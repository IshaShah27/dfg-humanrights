  ■    Annual one-on-one  director interviews are conducted by our lead independent director and chair of the Governance Committee and, every other year, by an independent third party.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The results of the director interviews are aggregated by our lead independent director, Governance  Committee chair, and if applicable, the independent third party, and reported to the Governance Committee and then to our full Board. Our Board will follow up on items identified in the evaluation process.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our Governance Committee discusses Board succession and reviews potential candidates. This process  takes place throughout the course of the year. Although the committee may retain third parties to assist in identifying potential nominees, it prefers internal references by directors who understand the needs and dynamics of the Board with a  particular focus on inclusion and diversity of ideas and background.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Feedback received in our 2018 Board evaluations noted the high-functioning nature of the Board and  the concern that a retirement age limit of 72 years would result in a near term imbalance of new and longer-tenured directors and the premature loss of valuable directors with years of company experience. The Board responded to this feedback by  amending our governance guidelines to increase the retirement age limit to 75 years.

Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Director Qualifications, Skills and Experience 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Each of the director nominees was chosen to serve on the Board based on his or her qualifications,  skills and experience, as discussed in their biographies, and how those characteristics serve the current needs of the Board and the company. For information about our business, strategy and goals, please see Compensation Discussion and  Analysis (CD&A).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    In making its nominations, the Governance Committee also assessed each director nominee by key  characteristics, including courage to voice opinions, integrity, experience, accountability, good judgment, supportiveness in working with others and willingness to commit the time needed to satisfy the requirements of Board and committee  membership.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    While the Governance Committee does not have a formal policy regarding diversity, the committee is  committed to maintaining Board diversity in thought, background and experiencea mix of gender, ethnic background, geographic origin and professional experience that supports our business strategy and the current needs of the Board.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    As discussed earlier, our governance guidelines provide that directors will not be nominated or  appointed to the Board if they are, or would be, 75 years or older at the time of the election or appointment. Term limits on directors service have not been instituted.  
[END TABLE]
Board composition and refreshment 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Governance Committee is focused on identifying qualified and diverse director candidates with  commensurate experience and background. The Boards current pool of potential candidates are mostly female and/or otherwise diverse candidates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Board comprises four directors with up to five years of tenure, four directors with tenure  between six and eleven years and four with over twelve years of tenure. This mix provides an even balance of experience and institutional knowledge with fresh perspectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Board is committed to regular refreshment to maintain an optimal balance of different  perspectives and proper oversight over the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Board was completely refreshed and rebuilt at the time of the Merger in 2011. The Merger  essentially created a new company with a new operating and corporate platform. At that time, all directors underwent intensive review to determine which directors would best fit the newly created combined company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Each director selected in this rebuilding process was onboarded as a new director to the newly  established company. These directors were required to perform in a new governance environment, with new structures, processes, committees, charters and guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We have continued to refresh the Board since the Merger. David OConnor onboarded as a new  director in 2015, Olivier Piani in 2017 and Cristina Bita and Philip Hawkins in 2018. Our director candidate search process actively identifies and assesses a pool of potential candidates through a variety of sources, primarily through internal  references. This process will serve to continue to refresh the Board and maintain a balanced mix of new perspectives and experience.

Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Director Independence 
We require that a majority of the Board be independent in accordance with NYSE rules. To determine whether a director is independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that there is no direct or indirect material relationship between the company and the director. 
92% of the Board is independent. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Board has determined that all our directors other than our chairman, Mr. Moghadam, are  independent.  
[END TABLE]
The Board reached this determination after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, reviewing director questionnaires and considering transactions and relationships, if any, between us, our affiliates, our executive officers and their affiliates, and each of the directors, members of each of their immediate families and their affiliates. 
Audit, Governance and Talent and Compensation Committees are 100% independent. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The Board has also determined that all members of the Audit, Governance and Talent and  Compensation Committees of the Board are independent in accordance with NYSE and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.  
[END TABLE]
Board Leadership Structure 
Our governance guidelines do not specify a leadership structure for the Board, allowing the Board the flexibility to choose the best option for the company as circumstances warrant. The Board believes that strong independent leadership ensures effective oversight over the company. Such independent oversight is maintained through: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    our lead independent director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    our independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    the Audit, Governance and Talent and Compensation Committees, which are all comprised entirely of  independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    annual review of the Board leadership structure and effectiveness of oversight through the Board  evaluation process; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    strong adherence to our governance guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
All of our independent directors have the ability to provide input for meeting agendas and are encouraged to raise topics for discussion by the Board. In addition, the Board and each Board committee has complete and open access to any member of management. 
Each committee has the authority to retain independent legal, financial and other advisors as they deem appropriate without consulting or obtaining the approval of any member of management. The Board also holds regularly scheduled executive sessions of only independent directors in order to promote free and open discussion among the independent directors.

Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Chairman and CEO assessment 
Our chairman and CEO and our lead independent director act together in a system of checks and balances, providing both strong oversight and operational insight. 
Our CEO, Mr. Moghadam, serves as chairman of the Board. The lead independent director role is focused on ensuring independent oversight of the company. Mr. Moghadam's roles as both CEO and chairman enable him to act as a bridge between management and the Board, ensuring that the Board understands our business when making its decisions. 
Mr. Moghadam has the breadth of experience to execute our unique business plan and provide special insight to the Board. 
Very few have experience running a public company with extensive global operations and substantial strategic capital and development businesses. Mr. Moghadam co-founded the company and has served on the Board since the company's initial public offering in November 1997. As one of our founders, Mr. Moghadam has extensive knowledge and expertise in the real estate and REIT industries, as well as history and knowledge of our company. 
Considering all of these factors, the Board believes that a structure that combines the roles of CEO and chairman, along with an independent lead director, independent chairs for each of the Board committees and independent non-employee directors, provides the best leadership for the company at this time and places the company in a competitive position to provide long-term value to our stockholders. 
Lead independent director 
If the offices of chairman and CEO are held by the same person, the independent members of the Board will annually elect an independent director to serve in a lead capacity. The lead independent director is generally expected to serve for more than one year. Mr. Lyons has been selected as the lead independent director by our Governance Committee and the independent members of our Board and has served in that capacity for nearly eight years. 
The lead independent director coordinates the activities of the other independent directors and performs such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine. 
The specific responsibilities of the lead independent director are currently as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Sessions/      Committee Meetings          ■  Presides at all  meetings of the Board at which the chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors (generally held at every regular Board meeting)   ■  Attends meetings  of the various Board committees regularly

Board Committees 
Pursuant to the Maryland General Corporation Law and our bylaws, our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. Members of the Board are kept informed of our business through our executive management team. 
The four standing committees of the Board are: Audit, Governance, Talent and Compensation (the "Compensation Committee") and Executive Committee (the "Executive Committee"). The Board has determined that each member of the Audit, Governance and Compensation Committees is an independent director in accordance with NYSE rules. 
The current membership information for our Board committees is presented below. 
Each committee has a charter which generally states the purpose of the committee and outlines the committee's structure and responsibilities. The committees, other than the Executive Committee, must review their charter on an annual basis.

CEO and management succession planning 
The Board is responsible for ensuring that we have a high-performing management team in place. The Board, with the assistance of the Compensation Committee, regularly conducts a detailed review of management development and succession planning activities to ensure that top management positions, including the CEO position, can be filled without undue interruption. 
Communications with directors 
We appreciate your input. You can communicate with any of the directors, individually or as a group, by writing to them in care of Edward S. Nekritz, Secretary, Prologis, Inc., Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Such communications will be reviewed and forwarded to the appropriate director. Each communication intended for the Board and received by the secretary that is related to the operation of the company and is not otherwise commercial in nature will be forwarded to the specified party following its clearance through normal security procedures. The directors will be advised of any communications that were excluded through normal security procedures as appropriate and they will be made available to any director who wishes to review them. 
Director attendance 
The Board held six meetings in 2018, including telephonic meetings, and all of the directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of Board and applicable committee meetings on which he or she served during 2018 (held during the periods they served). Each director standing for election in 2019 is expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, either in person or telephonically, absent cause. All of our directors except Mr. Zollars attended the annual meeting last year, in person or telephonically. 
Director compensation 
Please see "Director Compensation" and the table titled "Directors Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018." 
Stock ownership guidelines and prohibition on hedging/pledging 
Our directors must comply with our stock ownership guidelines which require the director to maintain an ownership level in our common stock equal to five times the annual cash retainer (a total of $600,000 as of December 31, 2018). Shares included as owned by directors for purposes of the guidelines include common stock owned, vested or unvested equity awards (restricted stock, restricted stock units, shares and share units deferred under the terms of

Until such time as the ownership thresholds are met, we will require directors to retain and hold 50% of any net shares of our common stock issued to our directors under our equity compensation plans. 
Additionally, our insider trading policy prohibits our directors and employees from hedging the economic risk of ownership of our common stock and from pledging shares of our common stock. 
All of our directors are currently in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines and the prohibition on hedging and pledging our common stock. 
Independent compensation consultant 
The Compensation Committee directly engages an outside compensation consulting firm, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") to assist the committee in assessing our compensation programs for our Board, our CEO and other members of executive management. FW Cook reports directly to the Compensation Committee. FW Cook receives no compensation from the company other than for its work in advising the Compensation Committee and maintains no other economic relationships with the company. FW Cook interacts directly with members of our management only on matters under the Compensation Committee's oversight. 
FW Cook conducted a comprehensive competitive review of the compensation program for our executive officers and our non-employee directors in 2018, which was used by the Compensation Committee to assist it in making compensation recommendations to the Board. Our CEO makes separate recommendations to the Compensation Committee concerning the form and amount of the compensation of our executive officers (excluding his own compensation). FW Cook has also assisted the Compensation Committee in evaluating the design of certain outperformance compensation plans implemented in 2012. 
Annually, the Compensation Committee considers the independence of FW Cook in light of the rules regarding compensation committee advisor independence mandated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"). The Compensation Committee reviewed factors, facts and circumstances regarding compensation consultant independence, including a letter from FW Cook addressing FW Cook's and their consulting team's independent status with respect to the following factors: (i) other services provided to us by FW Cook; (ii) fees we pay to FW Cook as a percentage of their total revenues; (iii) FW Cook's policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship between FW Cook or members of their consulting team that serves the Compensation Committee and a member of the Compensation Committee; (v) any shares of our stock owned by FW Cook or members of their consulting team that serves the Compensation Committee; and (vi) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and FW Cook or members of their consulting team that serves the Compensation Committee. After discussing these factors, facts and circumstances, the Compensation Committee affirmed the independent status of FW Cook and concluded that there are no conflicts of interest with respect to FW Cook. 
Compensation Committee interlocks and insider participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee (i) was, during the year ended December 31, 2018, or had previously been, an officer or employee of the company or (ii) had any material interest in a transaction with the company or a business relationship with, or any indebtedness to, the company. No interlocking relationships existed during the year ended December 31, 2018, between any member of the Board or the Compensation Committee and an executive officer of the company.

Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted a code of ethics and business conduct that applies to all employees and directors. The Board has formalized policies, procedures and standards of corporate governance that are reflected in our Governance Guidelines. 
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct outlines in great detail the key principles of ethical conduct expected of our employees, officers and directors, including matters related to conflicts of interest, use of company resources, fair dealing, and financial reporting and disclosure. The code establishes formal procedures for reporting illegal or unethical behavior to the company's internal ethics committee. These procedures permit employees to report any concerns, including concerns about the company's accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, on a confidential or anonymous basis if desired. Employees may contact the ethics committee by email, in writing, by web-based report or by calling a toll-free telephone number. Any significant concerns are reported to the Audit Committee in accordance with the code. 
Simultaneous Board service 
Our governance guidelines require that, if a director serves on three or more public company boards simultaneously, including our Board, a determination is made by our Board as to whether such simultaneous service impairs the ability of such member to effectively serve the company. Messrs. Fotiades, Losh, Lyons and Zollars and Ms. Kennard currently serve on at least three public company boards, including our Board. In each case, our Board has determined that such simultaneous board service does not impair the Board member's ability to be an effective member of our Board. None of our directors currently serve on more than five public company boards (including our Board). 
Certain relationships and related party transactions 
We do not have any related party transactions to report under relevant SEC rules and regulations. According to our Articles of Incorporation, the Board may authorize any agreement or other transaction with any party even though one or more of our directors or officers may be a party to such an agreement or is an officer, director, stockholder, member or partner of the other party if: (i) the existence of the relationship is disclosed or known to the Board, and the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the disinterested directors, even if they constitute less than a quorum of the Board; (ii) the existence is disclosed to the stockholders entitled to vote, and the contract or transaction is authorized, approved or ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote (excluding shares owned by any interested director or officer or the organization in which such person is a director or has a material financial interest); or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair and reasonable to the company. 
We recognize that transactions between us and related parties can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that our decisions are based on considerations other than the company's best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Related parties may include our directors, executives, significant stockholders and immediate family members and affiliates of such persons. Accordingly, several provisions of our code of ethics and business conduct are intended to help us avoid the conflicts and other issues that may arise in transactions between us and related parties, prescribing that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    employees will not engage in conduct or activity that may raise questions as to the companys  honesty, impartiality or reputation or otherwise cause embarrassment to the company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with, or leave the appearance of  conflicting with, the performance of their assigned duties;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    employees should avoid actual conflicts or the appearance of conflicts of interest.   
[END TABLE]
These provisions of our code of ethics and business conduct may be amended, modified or waived by the Board or the Governance Committee, subject to the disclosure requirements and other provisions of the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. 
No waivers of our code of ethics and business conduct were granted in 2018. 
Although we do not have detailed written procedures concerning the waiver of the application of our code of ethics and business conduct or the review and approval of transactions with directors or their affiliates, our directors would consider all relevant facts and circumstances in considering any such waiver or review and approval.

Prologis Environmental Stewardship: Innovating to Stay Ahead of Our 
Customers' Evolving Needs 
Anticipating the future and driving cost savings 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Future-proofing our building design allows us to stay ahead of our customers needs. With e-commerce acting as a tailwind for change, our customers are seeking locations closer to the end-consumer in the heart of urban consumption. Urban facilities in dense  population centers require compliance with noise, fuel emission and traffic ordinances, driving neighborhood friendly solutions like greater usage of electric vehicles and trucks and requiring design features, like EV charging stations, to  accommodate them.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Lighting is one of the primary drivers of electrical consumption in many distribution centers. We  are seeing our customers relying more heavily on robotics and electrical transport, which in turn lead to a heavier electrical load during peak hours. Energy efficient building design that can accommodate our customers changing needs is  essential. Efficient LED lighting is our standard for new development. Our LightSmart program has accelerated LED lighting upgrades throughout our portfolio, giving our customers the ability to tap into energy cost savings while they occupy the  space.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We are further advancing the efficiency of our building design by utilizing new sustainability  technologies and processes, including the installation of water-saving technologies and new ways to recycle construction materials during the development of new projects.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We have created Prologis Labs, an innovation incubator for testing products and  methods, often in collaboration with our customers, to stay in front of the logistics evolution. By tapping into our scale, we are mobilizing to employ data analytics across our global portfolio to help our customers be smarter in how they approach  their logistics spend.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    With customer-centricity at the forefront of how we approach our business, we are exploring  state-of-the-art technology to address our customers needs for improved operational efficiency, such as new systems to reduce dwell times of trucks waiting to unload goods. In addition to our modern, efficient facilities in prime infill  locations, such technological offerings can bolster the customer experience beyond what a typical real estate company can provide.

   Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis Summary  Our long-term planning has positioned us to take advantage of the future direction of the supply chain. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■     We anticipated the evolution of the global supply chain. Our business model  positions us to meet the logistics demands of our global customers who, in an ever-changing world, are increasingly focused on location and speed. Over years of planning, we have amassed approximately $87 billion in assets under management  (AUM) in the worlds most vibrant consumption markets in 19 countries.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■     Our structure positions us to not only withstand, but to thrive, in all economic  climates. Achieving our A3/A- credit rating(1) took years of careful balance sheet management and debt restructuring. Now we have $3.7 billion in liquidity and diverse sources of public and private  capital in seven strategic capital funds and three publicly traded companies. These vehicles operate primarily in their natural currency allowing us to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations. With our liquidity and ability to rebalance our  ownership in our strategic capital ventures, we can self-fund our run-rate deployment without the need to utilize the equity markets.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation correlates with the performance of our unique business model—a structure that drives our long-term operational and market growth. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■     Our forward-looking strategy sets us apart from our peers. Our global reach is  required by our global customers. Our strategic capital venture business gives us the funds to build scale in key global markets and share in balance sheet risk. Given the scarcity of modern facilities in urban centers, our development business  allows us to build what our customers need.  
[END TABLE]
And our vision enables us to stay ahead of what's next—to utilize our scale to provide benefits to our customers that surpass the capabilities of other logistics REITs.(2) Such benefits include global customer service, procurement cost-savings, data intelligence and innovation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■     Our business model works. Our three-year compound annual growth rates for net  earnings and Core FFO per share(3) were 20.5% and 10.8%, respectively. Our annualized three-year TSR(4) outperformed the Cohen & Steers REIT index(2) by 1191 basis points and the MSCI REIT Index(2) by 1168 basis points.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our global and comprehensive business model requires management with a greater universe of  responsibilities than our peers. Doing business in 19 countries expands the scope of our jobs beyond that of a company that focuses on a more limited platform. In addition to being in 18 more countries than any of our U.S. logistics REIT peers,  it is our job to serve 5,100 customers and manage 768 million square feet across seven strategic capital ventures and three publicly traded companiesmanaging nine times as many companies as our peers plus a development business that is  seven times bigger than our U.S. logistics REIT peer average. In fact, our AUM is 98% greater than all other U.S. logistics REITs combined.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We have structured our compensation program to address our greater scope of responsibilities  but only to the extent that performance justifies payment. We have targeted core compensation (base salary, bonus and annual equity awards) to the median of our peers, who are much smaller and more conventional in structure than us. To address  the greater size and scope of our business compared to other REITs, we have provided opportunities that only pay out when high-reach formulaic outperformance hurdles are met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our compensation reflects the level of our performance. 96% of our CEOs total  compensation in our 2018 Summary Compensation Table was determined based on performance, with most compensation components determined formulaically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our stockholders win when our compensation program pays out. When our outperformance plans  paid out in 2018, over $10.7 billion in value was created for our stockholders by exceeding the outperformance plan hurdles.(1)  The outperformance awards paid in aggregate were only  1.3% of the total value created for our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
2018 changes in our compensation program 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We continue to listen to our stockholders and assess our compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  In 2018, our CEO requested to take $1 for his base salary and be paid the remaining balance up to his previous  base salary of $1 million in equity contingent on performance with 4-year vesting. There is no upside to our CEO in this change. He cannot be paid any more than this remaining balance and could be paid  less depending on performance. This became effective starting in 2019, tying essentially 100% of his compensation to performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  We held NEO base salaries flat in the last three years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  We eliminated the bonus exchange premium for our NEOs starting with the 2018 performance year and extended  vesting from 3 to 4 years on the Prologis Promote Plan ("PPP") and our annual equity awards starting with the 2018 annual compensation cycle.

  –  We amended our Prologis Outperformance Plan ("POP") to add an absolute cap on potential performance  pools and 7-year cliff vesting on the bulk of earned equity starting with the 2018-2020 performance period. Application of the absolute cap reduced the maximum size of the estimated 2018-2020 performance pool  by 44% (compared to the pool applying the original cap).(2) Our NEOs voluntarily elected to apply the additional vesting restrictions retroactively to any of their POP awards earned for the  2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Common themes in 2018 outreach 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Our stockholders support our compensation program. They like to see a good balance of discretionary and formulaic  approaches in determining compensation, as long as the assessments are based on performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Stockholders appreciate longer-term vesting of equity awards for greater alignment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Some stockholders questioned the benefit of the bonus exchange premium offered to our NEOs.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Our stockholders were less focused on the size of compensation, provided the payouts are supported by performance  and value is created for the stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  Stockholders value our longstanding commitment to ESG (including inclusion and diversity) that is woven into the  fabric of the company. ESG is a growing focal point for our investors and their clients.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  Stockholders appreciated our outreach during proxy off-season at a time  when we did not have any particular requests, doing so to foster open communication.   
[END TABLE]
Changes we made 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Our CEO requested to take $1 for his base salary and shift the rest to equity compensation contingent on  performance and subject to 4-year vesting—to strengthen alignment of CEO compensation with performance. This change will be effective starting in 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  NEOs volunteered to forgo any retirement eligibility benefits in equity awards—to further demonstrate their  commitment to our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  We held our NEO salaries flat for the third year in a row.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  We amended POP to limit award size by applying an absolute cap on the potential performance pools and imposed a 7-year cliff vesting requirement on the bulk of any earned awards (starting with the 2018-2020 performance period). Our NEOs voluntarily elected to apply the additional vesting restrictions retroactively to any of  their POP awards earned for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods. Our NEOs did not receive any benefit in exchange for their election.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  We extended vesting periods on PPP and annual equity awards from 3 to 4 years starting with the 2018 annual  compensation cycle.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  We eliminated the bonus exchange premium for the NEOs, starting with bonuses for the 2018 performance year.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  We continue to demonstrate our industry-leading ESG practices. For example, we were the first in the logistics  sector to launch a community workforce initiative to help develop labor solutions for our customers. We were also the first to achieve employee health and wellness building design certification. Per investor feedback, we have enhanced our disclosure  on how we utilize ESG to advance our business.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Discussion of Compensation Comparison Group 
No REITs represent a true comparison to Prologis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our overall approach is to aim target core compensation at the median of our compensation  comparison group. To compensate for our much larger size and scope, we offer outperformance plan opportunities that can be earned only if superior performance is achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our Compensation Committee sets a competitive reference point for the elements of target total  core compensation (annual base salary, annual bonus and annual LTI equity awards) at the market median of a comparison group of large-cap REITs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Target compensation is positioned within a reasonable range of the competitive reference point  based on the NEOs level of experience, past performance and anticipated future contributions. Generally, this philosophy has contemplated base salaries and target bonuses around the 50th percentile and target annual LTI equity awards around  the 60th percentile of the competitive reference point. However, the Compensation Committee has decided to maintain aggregate core compensation of our NEOs at lesser levels than our philosophy might permit. According to our 2018 competitive  analysis, the aggregate core compensation of our NEOs on average was positioned lower than the median of the peer group. Although these findings support higher target core compensation, the Compensation Committee did not increase target core  compensation for the NEOs in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    In May 2018, FW Cook, our independent compensation consultant, conducted its annual compensation  analysis on behalf of the Compensation Committee. The comparison group used by FW Cook comprised 10 large-cap REITs that are generally the largest internally managed U.S. publicly traded equity REITs by market  capitalization.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
AUM is the most appropriate measure to gauge the size and scope of our business—it reflects the full portfolio upon which we are assessed by stockholders. 
 Due to the additional income generated by management fees and  promotes paid to us by our strategic capital ventures, our return  on assets held in our strategic capital business is greater than the  return on assets held on our balance sheet by approximately 300  bps. 
EXECUTIVES RESPONSIBLE FOR 100% OF AUM 
Consolidated financials do not capture a significant portion of our business performance.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Compensation Elements: Target Core Compensation is Aimed at the Median of Comparison Group 
Outperformance plans make up for the size and scope but only pay out with exceptional performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our overall approach is to aim target core compensation within a reasonable range of the median of  our comparison group. According to our 2018 competitive analysis, our NEO target core compensation on average was positioned lower than the median of our compensation group. We offer an outperformance opportunity to compensate for the difference in  the size and scope of our comparison group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The outperformance opportunities are not regular compensation elements. They are triggered only  when superior performance hurdles are met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our stockholders have voiced their support of this compensation structure through their 93%  approval of our previous say-on-pay proposal and their feedback during our outreach process prior to and after our say-on-pay vote. We consider these important factors in our continual assessments of our compensation programs, decisions and policies.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Strong correlation between CEO core compensation and relative three-year TSR and operational performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The following graphic illustrates the link between CEO core compensation and the companys  three-year TSR and Core FFO per share, demonstrating that core compensation is aligned with our TSR and operational performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Although we had strong operational performance in 2015, our three-year TSR at the end of 2015  underperformed the TSR indices of our equity formula. As core compensation primarily comprises annual LTI equity awards (measured by three-year TSR), our CEOs core compensation was impacted heavily when annual LTI equity awards were paid out  at only 50% of target due to TSR underperformance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we outperformed both operationally and in relative TSR performance,  correlating with CEO core compensation.

(2)  We calculate our outperformance by comparing the aggregate dollar value of our actual TSR versus  the aggregate value of our TSR had it tracked the TSR of the MSCI REIT Index over the same period of time. The aggregate dollar value of our TSR is generally the sum of (i) the increase in value of existing and newly issued shares, plus  (ii) cumulative dividends including reinvestment. Please see POP for further detail regarding the outperformance calculation. Prologis' aggregate TSR over 2016-2018 was $14.4 billion vs. $3.5 billion had our stock performance  matched the performance of the index.

  ■    About 100 participants receive an annual opportunity to earn awards under POP but only if  high-reach three-year relative TSR hurdles are met. A POP compensation pool only funds if and to the extent that our three-year, compound annualized TSR exceeds the three-year MSCI REIT Index annual return by 100 basis points.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The POP hurdle is high-reach and formulaic. Due to the difficulty of the performance hurdle, we  did not earn awards for the first two performance periods (2012-2014 and 2013-2015) under the plan.  
[END TABLE]

  ■    By surpassing the POP hurdle, we create value for our stockholders above the performance of the  MSCI REIT Index. In creating $10.1 billion of value by exceeding the POP hurdle for the 2016-2018 performance period, our CEO earned a $11.3 million POP award. This amount was only 0.1% of the $10.1 billion in outperformance generated  for our stockholders above the POP hurdle.

CEO PPP AWARDS VS. TOTAL VALUE CREATED FOR STOCKHOLDERS WHEN WE ACHIEVED PPP HURDLES(1)
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The "total value created when we achieved the PPP hurdles" is calculated by determining  our ownership share of the growth in net asset value (adjusting for dividends) of the applicable ventures during the incentive period, gross of any promote accrual for the applicable ventures, adding in management fees paid by such ventures to  Prologis during the same period. The "total value created when we achieved the PPP hurdles" excludes equity transactions that, while impacting net asset value, did not create value for the venture, such as capital contributions, returns of  capital, etc. It also excludes Prologis' ownership share of management fees paid to Prologis by the ventures. The promotes relevant to this calculation were the promotes related to the PPP awards paid in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
CEO PPP awards are a small fraction of the $618.1 million in value created when we achieved PPP hurdles.

  ■    PPP awards are earned if Prologis achieves certain high-reach promote hurdles. The promote  thresholds relating to PPP awards are certain investment rates of return established as an incentive to Prologis to drive exceptional performance of the applicable venture.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The promote hurdles are formulaic and difficult to achieve. Promotes are negotiated at arms  length with institutional investors whose interest is to set the hurdles at superior levels to warrant a payout of incentive fees to the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our stockholders and venture investors benefit when we exceed the strenuous promote hurdles.  $618.1 million in aggregate value was created for our stockholders over the relevant measurement periods, which represents Prologis ownership share of the net asset value growth of the three applicable ventures, the management fees paid  to Prologis during the measurement periods and the promotes paid to Prologis in achieving the hurdles. Surpassing these promote hurdles also means that we provided outsized returns to our venture investors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Due to surpassing the hurdles and earning the promotes, $9.5 million in aggregate PPP awards  was paid to our CEO in 2018. These PPP awards were only 1.5% of the $618.1 million in total value created for our stockholders when we achieved the strenuous hurdles.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our bonus structure allows for prudent decisions—downward discretion reduced 2018 bonuses despite strong operational performance. 
How we select our bonus metrics and set our targets 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We select bonus metrics and structure our bonus targets to reflect current company strategy. We  build our bonus targets accordingly to account for the interplay of bonus metrics in achieving our strategy as a whole. For example, our current strategy is to focus on rent increases, which is reflected in the levels of growth set in our targets.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our 2018 bonuses were largely determined by our performance on cornerstone operational metrics  (weighted at 40% of our total score): Core FFO per share, average occupancy, same store net operating income (SSNOI) growth and rent change on rollovers. These metrics are important to our  stockholders in assessing the health and performance of our business.  
[END TABLE]
Why our targets are rigorous 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our 2018 Core FFO bonus targets required performance better than 2017 actual performance. Our  target 2018 Core FFO per share(1) bonus metric (including a constant level of promotes) was 6% higher than our actual 2017 Core FFO per  share(1) similarly adjusted for a constant level of promotes. Our target 2018 rent change on rollover metric increased by 27% over our actual 2017 rent change on rollover. 2018 average occupancy  targets were about 100 bps higher than actual 2017 average occupancy. Our targeted 2018 SSNOI(1) was set at 3% growth over actual 2017 performance. Our performance over the long term exceeding  rigorous targets has resulted in 131% and 61% growth in our net earnings per share and Core FFO per share, respectively, over the past five years.(1)  
[END TABLE]
How the Compensation Committee approached our 2018 bonuses 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    As our compensation program is largely formulaic and bonuses are a relatively small component  (less than 10%) of our NEOs total compensation (per the 2018 Summary Compensation Table), the Compensation Committee believes it is appropriate to use a combination of quantitative and qualitative assessments in determining our bonuses.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Metrics constituting 75% of our bonus determination by weight (portfolio operations, deployment,  land and dispositions and strategic capital) are quantitatively assessed based on actual performance against metric levels set at a range between 50% to 200% of target. The committee does a qualitative assessment of how well we executed on our  strategic priorities, evaluating our quantitative results in the context of our overarching business plan. This also gives the committee the flexibility to avoid unintended consequences and ensure that we are not rewarding individuals hitting  formulaic benchmarks to the detriment of the long-term health of the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The committees past decisions have proven their ability to use their best judgment in a  prudent and responsible manner. They have rarely given a corporate score higher than 150% of target even in times of exceptional operational performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The committee exercised downward discretion for our bonuses for the 2018 performance year. In  2018, we continued to deliver solid operational performance but fell short on our new initiatives as outlined in the Prologis Five Drivers of Competitive Advantage (Five Drivers) bonus metric. This bonus metric, weighted at  25%, involved the start-up of a number of initiatives to push innovation. Given the early stages and the evolving structures of the Five Drivers initiatives, numerical targets were not set for the Five Drivers  metric and the committee based their determination on a qualitative assessment of performance for this metric.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Our CEO recommended to the Compensation Committee that the committee assign a below-target score  (75% of target) to our Five Drivers metric, as we had not made sufficient progress along this metric. Our CEO attributed responsibility to himself and the CFO to drive such initiatives and requested that the committee consider this factor in their  bonus assessment. After evaluating this recommendation along with our performance across all our bonus metrics, the committee gave our CEO and CFO overall scores (120% and 115% of target, respectively) lower than the corporate score.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Corporate score and NEO bonus assessments 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Similar to prior years, the Compensation Committee weighted portfolio operational metrics  significantly higher than any other bonus metric category (40% vs. 10%-25%) as the portfolio operational metrics have the most impact on the success of our business. Because our 2018 overall bonus score is  largely driven by portfolio operational results as the highest component of revenue of our business (and targets for other bonus metric categories are competitively sensitive), we only disclose targets for our operational metrics.

Mr. Reilly also drove G&A/AUM down across his regions leveraging scale and managing overhead growth. He, Mr. Nekritz and Mr. Olinger led the DCT acquisition and integration. Mr. Anderson delivered  exceptional operational and deployment performance with average occupancy greater than 97% and above target SSNOI growth in Europe and above target occupancy, rent change and SSNOI growth in Asia with record-breaking results in China.  Mr. Nekritz led his team in negotiations and execution of over $5 billion in real estate transactions (excluding the DCT transaction) as well as more than 2,000 lease transactions.   ■  Based on these results, the Compensation Committee scored our portfolio operations metric at 150% of target.

    ■  The profitability  of our development program continues to be excellent and, overall, above target. While our development stabilization, and land bank utilization results were below target, our development stabilization margin, disposition and contribution results  were all substantially above our stretch goals. Our land sales and monetization results were also above target.   ■  Mr. Curless  led our build-to-suit program with 29 development starts with $1.1 billion in total estimated investment. Mr. Anderson delivered strong development activity  and margins in Europe and Asia with record-breaking development starts in China. Mr. Reilly also oversaw $1.4 billion of new development starts in the Americas, ahead of plan. Under the leadership of Mr. Curless, we disposed of  $2.4 billion in non-strategic assets in 56 transactions. Mr. Curless and Mr. Nekritz led a $1.3 billion global disposition transaction.   ■  Based on these results, the Compensation Committee scored our development, land bank and dispositions metric at 162.5% of target.

Mr. Curless and Mr. Nekritz led a $1.3 billion global disposition transaction.   ■  Based on these results, the Compensation Committee scored our development, land bank and dispositions metric at 162.5% of target.      
    ■  The profitability  of our development program continues to be excellent and, overall, above target. While our development stabilization, and land bank utilization results were below target, our development stabilization margin, disposition and contribution results  were all substantially above our stretch goals. Our land sales and monetization results were also above target.   ■  Mr. Curless  led our build-to-suit program with 29 development starts with $1.1 billion in total estimated investment. Mr. Anderson delivered strong development activity  and margins in Europe and Asia with record-breaking development starts in China.

    ■  Our strategic  capital group had aggressive goals in 2018. Their strategic capital fair value AUM results were above target. Although our private fundraising was below target, the Compensation Committee also considered our deliberate change in strategy to not  require fund raising in 2018 in connection with the formation our Brazil joint venture. This decision was prudent but resulted in below target performance. This is another example of how our teams made decisions that were in the best interests of  the company even at the risk of missing their bonus targets.   ■  Fundraising teams  under Mr. Reilly and Mr. Anderson raised more than $2 billion in capital. Mr. Nekritz led the negotiations and execution of 35 equity investments, totaling $1.2 billion, in USLF and PELF, our U.S. and European logistics  funds. Mr. Reilly and Mr. Nekritz completed the negotiation of our new Brazil joint venture. The committee also considered the strength of our fund returns delivered by Mr. Reilly and Mr. Anderson, and the 30 billion yen  secondary offering by NPR, our Japanese public vehicle, led by Mr. Anderson and Mr. Olinger.   ■  All such factors  considered, the Compensation Committee scored our strategic capital metric at above target overall (at 125% of target).

    ■  Our Five Drivers  comprise five company priorities to push innovation, get ahead of the evolution of logistics and leverage our scale to capture value beyond real estate. These priorities focus on inclusion and diversity (the centerpiece of the Five Drivers),  customer experience, data analytics, procurement and ancillary revenues and services (PARS), and continuous improvement.   ■  We continued to  make progress on our Five Drivers. Our inclusion and diversity initiative made significant advances in the representation of women and ethnic diversity in our organization, increasing female representation in the ranks up to vice president, and  ethnic diversity amongst professional groups. We also completed key deliverables, including pilots of Prologis Essentials (our logistics customer e-commerce platform), customer data and property  characteristics projects, establishment of Prologis Labs and implementation of ways to optimize revenues.   ■  Mr. Anderson  led the roll-out of our PARS initiatives and the pilot of Prologis Essentials and gained significant traction under our LightSmart LED adoption program. Mr. Curless successfully rolled out a number of  customer experience deliverables, and Mr. Nekritz led our inclusion and diversity program and our ESG platform, supporting a number of our Five Drivers initiatives. Driving efficiency, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Nekritz and Mr. Olinger  further implemented lease automation technology, and Mr. Olinger made progress on our forecasting capabilities.   ■  Although we  advanced the Five Drivers, a number of projects were delivered late or not to the full scope of the original project. For this reason, on our CEOs recommendation, the Compensation Committee determined that our Five Drivers performance was  below target (75% of target).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ■  Under  Mr. Olingers leadership, we maintained our A3/A- ratings by Moodys and S&P(1), respectively, ending the year with $3.7 billion in  liquidity and one of the top balance sheets in our industry. Mr. Olinger successfully completed over $5.2 billion in debt transactions with an average rate of 2.1% and average term of 7.2 years and ended the year with U.S. dollar net  equity at 92.6%.   ■  Given that our bonus metrics reflect our current strategic goals, we did not allocate a portion of our bonus determination to a balance sheet/liquidity bonus metric as  we have already achieved our balance sheet goals. In short, we did not want to reward our executives for a goal already achieved.   ■  However, we do  account for the maintenance of our balance sheet health in our final assessment of our corporate and individual scores. The Compensation Committee will exercise its downward discretion to reduce the bonus payments if we fail to maintain our balance  sheet appropriately.

We closed the $8.5 billion DCT acquisition of high-quality complementary assets, realizing  $80 million in synergies. Results were ahead of plan on most performance targets. We delivered Core FFO of $2.89 per share (excluding promotes), representing an increase of 7% over 2017 and exceeding our 2018 target of $2.85 per share.(2)   ■  Our credit  metrics and balance sheet continue to be strong, showcasing our significant liquidity and capacity to self-fund our growth for the foreseeable future. Our annualized three-year TSR outperformed the Cohen & Steers REIT index by 1191 basis  points and the MSCI REIT Index by 1168 basis points. Mr. Moghadam and our other NEOs continue to drive innovation and improvement by leveraging our scale and global expertise to add value to our enterprise beyond our real estate.   ■  Considering the significantly above-target scores for the bulk of our bonus metrics (portfolio operations, deployment, land bank and dispositions and strategic capital)  and the below-target score for our Five Drivers metric, the Compensation Committee determined that our overall corporate score was above target (125% of target).

Our annualized three-year TSR outperformed the Cohen & Steers REIT index by 1191 basis  points and the MSCI REIT Index by 1168 basis points. Mr. Moghadam and our other NEOs continue to drive innovation and improvement by leveraging our scale and global expertise to add value to our enterprise beyond our real estate.   ■  Considering the significantly above-target scores for the bulk of our bonus metrics (portfolio operations, deployment, land bank and dispositions and strategic capital)  and the below-target score for our Five Drivers metric, the Compensation Committee determined that our overall corporate score was above target (125% of target).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Annual LTI equity award benchmarks are a balance of logistics and large-cap REITs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    We use two logistics REIT comparison groups (one domestic and one global) to compare our TSR  performance against other REITs operating in our asset class. Because the companies in these comparison groups are much smaller than Prologis, we also use a large-cap REIT index, the Cohen & Steers  REIT Index, to compare our performance against similarly-sized companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The weightings between the domestic and global logistics REIT comparison groups generally reflect  the relative breakdown between our global and domestic AUM.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Very few logistics REITs and even fewer global logistics REITs exist. The Cohen & Steers  REIT Index is a performance benchmark that includes approximately 30 well-capitalized REITs. The Cohen & Steers REIT Index mitigates volatility of our smaller logistics REIT comparison groups and prevents any one company from dominating the  indexs performance. This index is a measure important to our investors to evaluate our performance against other large-cap REITs.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    POP awards cannot be paid at a time when our absolute TSR is negative. If a pool funds because our  relative TSR exceeds the POP performance hurdle, but our absolute three-year TSR is not positive, then the awards will not be paid unless and until absolute TSR becomes positive. The award will expire seven years after the end of the performance  period if absolute TSR does not become positive within that period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    POP awards are a small percentage of the overall value created for our stockholders. As discussed  in the CEO analysis above, our CEOs POP award for the 2016-2018 performance period was only 0.1% of the $10.1 billion in value created for our stockholders in exceeding the POP hurdle.

(1)  The POP hurdle is 100 bps above the three-year compound annualized TSR of the MSCI REIT Index. See  footnotes to "CEO POP Award vs. Total Value Created for Stockholders in Exceeding POP Hurdle."

[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    For performance periods starting prior to 2018, the POP compensation pool for each performance  cycle is capped at the greater of $75 million and 0.5% of our equity market capitalization at the start of a performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    In response to stockholder feedback, we reduced the potential size of the pool by applying an  absolute maximum cap of $100 million starting with the 2018-2020 performance period and imposed 7-year cliff vesting on the bulk of the earned awards (in lieu of the additional performance hurdles for  amounts above $75 million to simplify the plan). Application of the absolute cap reduced the maximum size of the estimated 2018-2020 performance pool by 44% (compared to the pool applying the original cap).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Under the new construct, only 20% of POP awards are paid, if earned, at the end of the performance  period. 80% of such earned awards are subject to the additional 7-year cliff vesting. The 20% that is paid at the end of the 3-year performance period is subject to an  additional 3-year holding requirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Although the new construct is effective for performance periods starting in 2018, our NEOs  voluntarily elected to apply this construct retroactively to any of their awards earned for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods. The NEOs did not receive any benefit in exchange for their election. Please see Narrative Discussion to  Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 for further detail.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    PPP performance hurdles are the formulaic promote hurdles established by our strategic capital  ventures to incentivize superior performance. Promotes are earned by Prologis when returns in certain of our ventures exceed pre-negotiated preferred return hurdles. These promotes are third-party validated  measures of operational success.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    For a number of our ventures, meeting a promote hurdle requires an internal rate of return in  excess of a 7% to 9% annualized return (based on current hurdles as negotiated with our venture partners). Promotes are often structured such that the company receives 10% to 20% of returns above the negotiated return hurdles. For certain of our  ventures, we negotiated a structure with higher management fees and no promotes, determining that the structure was in the best interests of the company (even if the structure would not have promotes eligible for PPP award opportunities). The  performance period for promotes with respect to our operating portfolios is generally three years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    To meet or surpass the promote hurdles, we must make smart capital allocation decisions and manage  our assets to produce outstanding returns over an extended period of time.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Achievement of promote hurdles means we have created superior returns for our venture investors.  This also translates into tremendous value created for our stockholders over the applicable performance periods by increasing the value of our ownership share of the ventures as well as driving earnings from promote and management fee payments.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    When we achieve the difficult promote hurdle and the company earns the promote, the promote  proceeds are used to fund a PPP compensation pool. This pool is 40% of the promote (after excluding our ownership share in the applicable venture) typically paid to about 100 participants in total.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Individual awards under PPP are capped at the participants compensation (excluding awards  under the two outperformance compensation plans) for the two most recently completed years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    As discussed in the CEO analysis above, our CEOs PPP awards paid in 2018 were only 1.5% of  the total value created for our stockholders when we achieved the promote hurdles.

LTIP Units 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    LTIP Units are profits interests in Prologis, L.P., our operating partnership. Certain executives,  including NEOs, may elect to receive LTIP Units in lieu of RSUs. Generally, our NEOs elected to receive all of their equity awards granted in 2018 in LTIP Units, further aligning NEO and stockholder interests. Mr. Olinger elected to receive his  2018 PPP equity awards as RSUs.

  ■    LTIP Units were structured to be generally economically equivalent to RSUs and generally have the  same vesting terms as RSUs.  
[END TABLE]
NEO waivers of retirement eligibility benefits 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    For any equity awards granted starting in 2017, Mr. Moghadam waived any vesting benefits  related to meeting retirement-eligibility thresholds under our incentive plan. Vesting under such awards will continue after he terminates employment as long as he continues in a substantial role with the company or its affiliates. Our other NEOs  executed a similar waiver applicable to equity awards granted after September 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    To demonstrate their commitment to our company, our NEOs executed these waivers voluntarily  without receiving any benefit in exchange.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Had the NEOs not waived such provisions, they would be entitled to certain benefits such as the  acceleration of vesting of their equity awards upon termination of employment after they meet the retirement-eligibility thresholds under our compensation plans.

Hedging and pledging policies 
All hedging and pledging of common stock are prohibited: Our insider trading policy prohibits all NEOs, employees and directors from hedging or pledging shares of our common stock. All of our NEOs and directors are currently in compliance with this prohibition. 
Compensation recoupment (clawback) policy 
The Board has adopted a compensation clawback policy, which provides that in the event of a substantial restatement of our previously issued financial statements, a review will be undertaken by the Board of performance-based compensation awarded to certain officers that was attributable to our financial performance during the time periods restated. If the Board determines that an officer was improperly compensated and that it is in our best interests to recover or cancel such compensation, the Board will pursue all reasonable legal remedies to recover or cancel such performance-based compensation. The policy further provides that if the Board learns of any misconduct by certain officers that caused the restatement, the Board shall take such action as it deems necessary to remedy the misconduct, prevent its recurrence and, if appropriate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, punish the wrongdoer. Such punishment by the Board could include dismissal, legal action for breach of fiduciary duty or such other action to enforce the officer's obligations to us as may fit the facts surrounding the particular case. In determining the appropriate punishment, the Board may take into account punishments imposed by third parties. The Board's power to determine the appropriate punishment for the wrongdoer is in addition to, and not in replacement of, remedies imposed by such third parties. 
Equity grant policy and program administration 
Awards are administered by our human resources and stock plan administration departments. Grants are made generally in the first quarter of the year, after promotion, at the time of new hire or in accordance with PPP. Equity grant dates are not scheduled based on the timing of the release of material non-public information. 
We discontinued the issuance of stock option awards after February 2011. 
Impact of accounting and tax treatment 
To the extent reasonable, all executive compensation will be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes. However, the Compensation Committee may design compensation program components that are not

Compensation Discussion and Analysis deductible. Because we intend to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, we generally distribute 100% of our net taxable income each year, and therefore do not pay U.S. federal income tax. As a result, the possible loss of a federal tax deduction would not be expected to have a material impact on us. We intend that executive compensation comply with 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which may impose additional taxes on our NEOs for arrangements that provide for the payment of deferred compensation that is not exempt or in compliance with Section 409A. In addition, we expense base salaries paid in the year they are earned and annual bonus awarded in cash in the year they are earned. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, we expense the value of equity awards granted over the vesting period of such grants. The Internal Revenue Service has ruled privately that compensation paid by a REIT's operating partnership attributable to services provided to the operating partnership is not subject to Section 162(m).

Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Represents the allocation of the estimated POP compensation pool in January 2018 for the 2018-2020  performance period. Since POP rewards only extraordinary performance, there is no Threshold or Target value. Notwithstanding the values of allocations shown in this table, there can be no assurance that the company's performance at the end of  an applicable performance period will result in any payment under POP. The amount in column (h) represents the NEO's allocation of the maximum pool value for the 2018-2020 Performance Period of $100.0 million. The value in column  (l) is the grant-date fair value of the NEO's allocation based on a valuation of the future compensation pool using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the grant date to estimate a fair value for accounting purposes, estimated at  $22.7 million. Awards under POP may be paid in either cash or equity (with an additional 7-year cliff vesting requirement on 80% of the applicable award and no additional vesting on 20% of the applicable  award). The Compensation Committee has determined that the awards for the 2018-2020 Performance Period will be paid in equity, if at all. POP LTIP Units for the 2018-2020 performance period were issued on December 11, 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The NEO was awarded a compensation opportunity through participation in PPP. PPP compensation  pools were determined in January 2018, June 2018 and December 2018 after incentive fees, or promotes, were earned and paid to us by three of our co-investment ventures. As a result, the NEOs each earned PPP  awards related to these promotes. Mr. Moghadam's entire award was paid in the form of equity, and the remaining NEOs' awards were paid in the form of cash (35%) and equity (65%). Mr. Reilly, Mr. Nekritz, Mr. Anderson  and Mr. Curless elected to receive the equity portion of their award in the form of LTIP Units, and Mr. Olinger elected to receive the equity portion of his award in RSUs. The LTIP Units were issued in January 2018, July 2018 and December  2018, and the RSUs were issued in January 2018, June 2018 and December 2018. LTIP units and RSUs issued in January 2018 vest ratably over a three-year period. LTIP Units and RSUs issued in June, July and December 2018 vest ratably over a four-year  period. The values of the LTIP Units granted are included in column (l) of this table based on the fair value of $62.65 per share for the January 2018 grant, $63.51 per share for the July 2018 grant and $68.48 per share for the December 2018  grant and the value of the RSUs issued in June 2018 was 63.51 per share, which were the closing prices of our common stock on the applicable grant dates (the dates the Compensation Committee granted the awards). This value is used for accounting  purposes to expense the grant. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Represents the annual long-term equity incentive awards for the performance year ended in 2017  that were granted in 2018. These awards were approved by the Compensation Committee on February 9, 2018 at which time the NEO elected to receive the award in the form of LTIP Units. The LTIP Units were issued in March 7, 2018 and vest  ratably over a four-year period. The value in column (l) represents the award in column (i) valued at $60.32 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the February 9, 2018 award grant date. This value is used for  accounting purposes to expense the grant. Annual long-term equity incentive awards for the performance year ended in 2018 were granted by the Compensation Committee in February 2019 and are not included in this table.

The 2012 LTIP enables our executive officers, employees, directors and consultants to participate in the ownership of the company and allows us to attract and retain our executive officers, other employees and directors, as well as provide incentives to such persons to maximize our company performance. 
In addition, we have other equity compensation plans under which equity awards were outstanding as of December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    the Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and the Third Amended and Restated  1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, collectively, the AMB Plans, which were both approved by our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    the ProLogis 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the ProLogis 2000 Share Option Plan for Outside  Trustees and the ProLogis 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan, collectively, the Trust Plans, which were assumed by us under the Merger agreement with all outstanding awards converted based on the Merger exchange ratio. The Trust Plans were  approved by shareholders of the Trust.  
[END TABLE]
All future equity awards will be granted from the 2012 LTIP and we will no longer grant any awards from the AMB Plans or the Trust Plans. The available shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the AMB Plans and the Trust Plans as of May 3, 2012 were added to the share reserve of the 2012 LTIP. All outstanding awards under the AMB Plans and the Trust Plans will remain outstanding until they vest, expire or are forfeited by the participant. As of December 31, 2018, we had 6.1 million shares of common stock remaining available for future issuance under our plans and 9.8 million shares of common stock subject to outstanding unvested awards. 
The 2012 LTIP does not expire but no further awards can be granted under the plan after the tenth anniversary date of the plan's approval. The 2012 LTIP does not permit re-pricing of stock options without stockholder approval. Participants, including non-employee directors, in the 2012 LTIP may receive stock options, stock appreciation rights and full value awards, including dividend equivalents. Only employees may receive incentive stock options under the 2012 LTIP; however, we have not granted incentive stock options in the past and currently do not intend to grant stock options of any kind. 
For further detail, please see "Equity Compensation Plans" below. 
Equity award terms 
We currently intend to grant LTIP Units and RSUs for annual LTI equity and PPP awards. Restricted stock awards were last granted in 2012, and stock options were last granted in 2011. In addition, we provided certain executives with opportunities to earn awards under POP. Beginning in 2014, we offered to certain executives the option to elect to receive LTIP Units in lieu of RSUs that may be granted to them under our compensation program. The general terms of our equity awards outstanding at December 31, 2018 are as follows: 
RSUs 
Each RSU is convertible into one share of common stock upon vesting. The RSUs granted prior to the 2018 annual grant cycle generally vest ratably over a continued service period of three years, such that the awards vest 34% after the first year, 33% after the second year and 33% after the third year. RSUs granted in the 2018 annual grant cycle vest ratably over a period of four years, such that 25% of the award vests each year of the four-year period. Going

[END TABLE]
Discussion of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards forward, we intend to grant RSUs for annual LTI equity awards and PPP awards with four-year vesting periods. RSUs granted in accordance with the 2018 POP amendment will have a seven-year cliff vesting period (i.e., the entire award vests on a specified future date) after the end of the initial three-year performance period. RSUs have no voting rights. Certain awards, such as special grants due to hiring or retention considerations, may have different vesting terms, including cliff vesting terms. RSUs granted to NEOs as a part of the bonus exchange for 2016 and 2017 generally have a three-year vesting period, such that the bonus exchange awards vest 40% after the first year, 40% after the second year and 20% after the third year. As we eliminated the premium for bonus exchange starting in 2018, equity received by the NEOs in 2019 in exchange for their 2018 bonus did not include a premium and were fully vested upon issuance. Generally, RSUs earn dividend equivalents (either cash or equity) over the vesting period under the same payment terms as dividends paid on our common stock. RSUs are valued based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. 
LTIP Units 
Certain participants in the 2012 LTIP can elect to receive LTIP Units instead of RSUs. LTIP Units have similar terms to RSUs with respect to vesting provisions, voting rights and dividends. LTIP Units are different from POP LTIP Units granted under POP (as discussed below). LTIP Units are structured with the intent that the units will generally be economically equivalent to the RSUs that would be issued for the applicable awards and generally have the same vesting terms as the RSUs that are granted. Under certain conditions, an LTIP Unit is convertible into a common unit and then redeemable for one share of our common stock, or at our option, cash. Among other conditions, LTIP Units cannot be converted until they are vested and a waiting period of two years from the date of issuance is complete. Like RSUs, LTIP Units earn cash distributions equal to the dividend paid on our common stock. After vesting and other conditions are met, LTIP Units remain outstanding until such time as the holder of the LTIP Units elects to convert. 
For any equity awards granted starting in 2017, including issuances of LTIP Units, Mr. Moghadam has waived any vesting benefits related to meeting retirement-eligibility thresholds under our incentive plan. Vesting under such awards will continue after he terminates employment as long as he continues in a substantial role with the company or its affiliates. Our other NEOs executed a similar waiver applicable to equity awards granted after September 2018. 
POP Allocations 
Please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for a discussion of the general structure of POP and how it fits into our overall compensation program. 
Under POP, NEOs are allocated a percentage of a potential compensation pool for each performance period (the "POP Allocations"). We made POP Allocations to the NEOs in 2018 for the 2018-2020 performance period, in 2017 for the 2017-2019 performance period, and in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period. 
The POP Allocations are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the grant date. POP Allocations were structured with the intent that the allocations have no economic value to the participants unless and until performance criteria are met and an award is paid for the applicable performance period. 
For each performance period, the Compensation Committee made POP Allocations to the NEOs such that 15% of the compensation pool will be paid to Mr. Moghadam and 6% of the compensation pool will be paid to each of the other NEOs if such awards are earned. In allocating the percentage of the compensation pools to the NEOs, the Compensation Committee took into consideration external market data concerning the typical ratio of CEO compensation to that of other NEOs and employees. The Compensation Committee generally allocated a smaller portion of the total compensation pool to the NEOs relative to the other participants than is typical in the outperformance plans of other companies the committee reviewed at the inception of the plan. The compensation pool for each performance period covered approximately 100 participants at the beginning of each performance period. 
Earned POP awards can be paid in either cash or equity. The Compensation Committee has determined that the awards will be paid, if at all, in equity. Earned POP awards cannot be paid unless and until absolute TSR becomes

[END TABLE]
Discussion of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards positive. Any earned POP award will expire seven years after the end of the performance period, if absolute TSR does not become positive within that period. 
POP LTIP Units. Certain members of the executive management team, including the NEOs, elected to exchange their POP Allocations for special LTIP Units (the "POP LTIP Units") as defined under the operating partnership agreement of Prologis, L.P., as amended and/or restated from time to time. 
The POP LTIP Units are structured with the intent that the units will be comparable economically to the awards under POP. A participant electing to receive the POP LTIP Units will receive the same percentage of the pool as if the participant had not participated in the exchange. Like other forms of awards under the plan, the POP LTIP Units will have no economic value to the participants until and unless the performance criteria are achieved at the end of a performance period and other conditions are met. Once the Compensation Committee determines whether the performance criteria have been met, the POP LTIP Units will be forfeited to the extent not earned based on the terms of POP. To the extent an award is earned, a NEO will retain the number of POP LTIP Units equal in economic value to the percentage of the performance pool originally allocated to the NEO at the beginning of the applicable performance period. Any POP LTIP Units in excess of such amount will be forfeited. Additional LTIP Units will be issued to true up the original number of POP LTIP units issued for the performance period to the extent such original issuance was insufficient to cover the value of the earned award. 
Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including achievement of the relevant performance criteria, each POP LTIP Unit may be convertible into a common unit of the operating partnership and then redeemable for one share of our common stock, or cash at our option. 
As has become standard tax structuring for profits interests that only vest if performance hurdles are met, the POP LTIP Units are entitled to distributions during the performance period equal to 10% of our common stock dividend. However, contrary to most performance-based programs at other REITs, we are requiring participants to make a significant, non-refundable capital contribution for the POP LTIP Units they receive. This feature is intended to make POP LTIP Units comparable economically to POP Allocations to applicable participants. This structure is designed so that participants receive no additional compensation as a result of the exchange of POP Allocations into POP LTIP Units. This creates downside risk for participants if the performance hurdles are not achieved causing the forfeiture of the capital invested in their POP LTIP Units. 
As such, the issuance of POP LTIP Units in exchange for POP Allocations does not affect the compensation amounts for the NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table or in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The exchange of the POP LTIP Units for POP Allocations does not result in incremental fair value for accounting purposes and does not change the total compensation of the NEOs. As a result, the issuance of the POP LTIP Units in exchange for POP Allocations does not change the presentation of the value of the POP Allocations in the Summary Compensation Table or in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The POP LTIP Units are included in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table at their threshold value at December 31, 2018. 
As discussed in CD&A, the POP compensation pool only funds if and to the extent our three-year, compound annualized TSR exceeds the three-year compound annualized TSR of the MSCI REIT Index by 100 basis points.

  ■    2016-2018 performance period: This performance period began on January 1, 2016 and  ended on December 31, 2018, including 110 participants at its start. The value of the potential compensation pool on June 3, 2016, the date POP Allocations were awarded, was $26.6 million, determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.  Variables used in the simulation under a risk-neutral premise include: (i) expected volatility of our common stock of 23%; (ii) expected volatility of the MSCI REIT Index of 18%; and (iii) correlation between our common stock and the MSCI  REIT Index of 89%. The potential compensation pool was capped at $115.0 million, which was 0.5% of our equity market capitalization at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, the value of this compensation pool was  $115.0 million. Awards for the 2016-2018 performance period were determined by the Compensation Committee on January 9, 2019, resulting in a $11.3 million award paid to Mr. Moghadam and $4.5 million paid to each of our NEOs.  The remaining amount will be paid in accordance with the plan as described below.

The value of the potential compensation pool on January 2, 2018, the date POP Allocations were awarded, was $22.7 million, determined using a Monte Carlo  simulation. Variables used in the simulation under a risk-neutral premise include: (i) expected volatility of our common stock of 19%; (ii) expected volatility of the MSCI REIT Index of 14%; and (iii) correlation between our common stock  and the MSCI REIT Index of 87%. The potential compensation pool was capped at $100.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the projected value of this compensation pool was zero.  
[END TABLE]
The 2016 amendment of POP, applicable to the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods, requires us to exceed the initial performance hurdle (100 basis points above the three-year compound annualized TSR of the MSCI REIT Index) to earn awards for the applicable performance period. If the initial performance hurdle is met, the portion of the compensation pool up to $75 million will be paid out at the end of the initial three-year performance period. One-third of the excess amount of the compensation pool above $75 million will be paid at the end of each of the three years following the initial three-year performance period, if we perform at or above the index at the end of each applicable year. A holding requirement applies to any equity paid under the plan until the sixth year after the beginning of the performance period. If our absolute TSR is not positive, we will not be paid any amounts under the plan unless and until our absolute TSR turns positive. If our absolute TSR fails to turn positive within seven years after achieving the performance hurdle at the end of the initial three-year performance period, our awards will be forfeited. 
In the case of the 2016-2018 performance period, we met the initial performance hurdle and the Compensation Committee determined that the size of the compensation pool was $115.0 million (at the maximum cap of 0.5% of our market capitalization). As a result of such determination, awards of $75 million in aggregate were paid to approximately 100 participants in accordance with POP. One-third of $40.0 million (the amount of the total compensation pool exceeding $75 million) will be paid to all applicable participants according to their POP Allocations at the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021 only if we continue to perform at or above the MSCI REIT Index at the end of those years. If we meet these additional performance hurdles, then Mr. Moghadam has the opportunity to receive $2.0 million and the other NEOs have the opportunity to receive $0.8 million in POP awards after the end of each of the next three years. 
In 2018, our NEOs voluntarily elected to apply long-term cliff vesting to 80% of any awards earned for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods. Under their election, 20% of amounts earned under applicable hurdles will be paid at the time applicable hurdles are met. A holding requirement will apply to these amounts until the sixth year after the beginning of the performance period. 80% of amounts earned under applicable hurdles will be subject to cliff vesting until the tenth year after the beginning of the performance period. In the case of the 2016-2018 performance period, for example, Mr. Moghadam was paid an initial award of $11.3 million. 20% of the $11.3 million award was paid to him in LTIP units in January 2019. A holding period applies to this amount until 2022 (the sixth year after the beginning of the performance period). LTIP units comprising 80% of the $11.3 million are subject to cliff vesting until 2026 (ten years after the beginning of the performance period). If we meet or exceed the MSCI REIT Index at the end of 2019, Mr. Moghadam will be paid 20% of $2 million in LTIP units in January 2020 once the award is approved by the Compensation Committee. A holding period applies to this amount until 2022. LTIP units comprising 80% of the $2 million will be subject to cliff vesting until 2026. The same vesting construct will be applied to each of the $2 million awards that can be paid at the end of 2020 and 2021 if the additional performance hurdles are met, subjecting 80% of such awards to cliff vesting until 2026. See discussion of POP for the 2018-2020 performance period in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for further details. 
PPP Allocations

Discussion of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
Under PPP, NEOs receive an allocation representing their share of a potential compensation pool (the "PPP Allocations") that, if funded, will be awarded to the NEO in a percentage of equity with any remainder in cash. The equity portion of the earned award would be paid in RSUs or LTIP Units with a four-year vesting period (or three-year vesting period for awards granted prior to the 2018 annual grant cycle). The PPP Allocations have no value unless and until an incentive fee or promote is received and the Compensation Committee grants the applicable PPP award. No awards or values are reported as of the date of the PPP Allocations because it is not possible to determine whether any incentive fees or promotes will be received in future years from a particular venture. For accounting purposes, the cash awards will be expensed when earned and paid to participants and the equity awards are expensed over the vesting period. 
For each applicable venture, the Compensation Committee made PPP Allocations to the NEOs such that 15% of the compensation pool will be paid to Mr. Moghadam and 6% of the compensation pool will be paid to each of the other NEOs if such awards are earned. In determining the PPP Allocations to the NEOs, the Compensation Committee utilized a similar rationale as with the POP Allocations discussed above. 
PPP compensation pools were funded in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The value of a PPP award earned by a NEO is reported as compensation in the year the award is paid to the NEO on the date of determination by the Compensation Committee. The cash awards earned by the NEOs in 2018, 2017 and 2016 under PPP are included as "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 for the respective year. The equity awards (LTIP Units) are included as "Stock Awards" in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal Year 2018 for the respective year. 
Stock options 
We discontinued the issuance of stock options prior to the Merger in June 2011. Stock options outstanding are all vested and exercisable. Stock options granted generally vested ratably over a continued service period of three years, however; certain stock options previously granted as a result of the bonus exchange vested over a one-year period (25% per quarter). Stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. The exercise price for any outstanding stock option may not be decreased after the grant date except for reductions approved by our stockholders or if there is an overall adjustment to our outstanding shares, such as an adjustment triggered by a stock split. Stock options expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.

(2)  Participants in our nonqualified deferred compensation plans prior to the Merger received a lump-sum payment, triggered by the Merger, equal to the value of their account balance in June 2011. After the Merger, we established a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is discussed in further detail  below. Under this Notional Account NQDC Plan, an initial account credit value was established for the NEO who received distributions from this plan in June 2011 as a result of the Merger. Participants in the Notional Account NQDC are credited with  the excess in value, if any, of their Notional Earnings Account (representing the initial account credit value plus the cumulative earnings or losses associated with the underlying, hypothetical investments, if any) over the initial account credit  value. The amount in column (f) represents the excess of the participant's notional earnings account value over the initial account credit value as of December 31, 2018. The extent to which this excess is attributable to changes in  values during 2018 is reflected as earnings for 2018 in column (d). The initial account credit value is not reflected in this table because the participant does not have a right to the initial account credit value. See the narrative discussion that  follows these footnotes.

Narrative Discussion to Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018 Table 
2012 NQDC Plan 
Effective 2012, we established a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the "2012 NQDC Plan"). The 2012 NQDC Plan allows certain eligible employees and non-employee directors of the company and our participating subsidiaries to elect to defer up to 100% of their eligible compensation, such as annual salary, bonus, equity awards and directors' fees, that were earned and vested on or after January 1, 2012. The deferred compensation under the 2012 NQDC Plan is our unsecured obligation and amounts deferred are held in a rabbi trust. Participants select from various investment options available under the plan to earn investment credits on their elective deferrals. There are no guaranteed returns for any of the investment options or for any participants in the plans. The amount of earnings that a participant receives depends on the participant's investment elections related to cash balances in the account and, with respect to shares of our common stock that have been deferred, the dividends earned on that stock and the change in market value of the stock during the period. The 2012 NQDC Plan offers a variety of investment choices with respect to cash contributions. Our common stock is not an investment option available with respect to deferrals of cash compensation. The NEOs did not elect to defer any of their 2018 compensation (salary, bonus or equity awards) under the 2012 NQDC Plan.

[END TABLE]
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
If a participant elects to defer the receipt of an equity award, the underlying common stock is held in the rabbi trust, which cannot be reinvested in any other investment option. Cash dividends earned on these shares of our common stock after deferral are credited with earnings and losses based on specific investment options, other than our common stock, that are selected by the participant. Distributions under these plans are made in a lump sum payment upon termination of employment, or service as a non-employee director, or in the event of a change in control or death of a participant. With respect to equity awards deferred by non-employee directors, participants may elect to receive distributions prior to termination of service. 
We have reserved the right under the 2012 NQDC Plan to make discretionary matching contributions to participant accounts from time to time. No such discretionary contributions have been made. The participants' elective deferrals and matching contributions, if any, are fully vested at all times. We pay all of the administrative costs associated with the 2012 NQDC Plan. Generally, the compensation that is deferred is tax-deferred until it is distributed to the participant. However, amounts deferred are subject to FICA and Medicare employee and employer taxes in accordance with statutory requirements. 
In December 2014, the 2012 NQDC Plan was amended, primarily to allow for LTIP Units to be issued in lieu of other deferred compensation upon a distribution event. 
AMB NQ Plans 
Prior to the Merger, we maintained two nonqualified deferred compensation plans: (i) the Amended and Restated AMB 2005 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2005 NQ Plan") and (ii) the Amended and Restated Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2002 NQ Plan") (together, the "AMB NQ Plans"). The AMB NQ Plans allowed our directors and certain eligible employees to defer certain compensation, including the receipt of restricted stock awards and, in the case of the 2002 NQ Plan, gains from exercise of stock options, received under our equity compensation plans. The AMB NQ Plans provided that upon a change in control, such as the Merger in June 2011, participants would receive a lump-sum payment equal to the vested account balance. Such distributions were made in 2011. 
Compensation subject to deferral elections made under the AMB NQ Plans prior to the Merger with respect to compensation earned in 2011 and beyond was not subject to the distributions under the AMB NQ Plans triggered by the Merger. Mr. Moghadam has deferred certain gains resulting from the exercise of stock options under the 2002 NQ Plan. In addition, Mr. Moghadam and Mr. Olinger have deferred shares of our common stock received upon vesting of certain equity awards under the 2005 NQ Plan. 
The deferred compensation under the AMB NQ Plans is our unsecured obligation and amounts deferred are held in a rabbi trust. Participants select from various investment options available under the plans to receive investment credit on their elective deferrals. There are no guaranteed returns for any of the investment options or for any participants in the plans. The amount of earnings that a participant receives depends on the participant's investment elections related to cash balances in the account and, with respect to deferred shares of our common stock, the dividends earned on the stock and the change in market value of the stock during the period. Cash dividends earned on shares of our common stock after deferral are credited earnings and losses based on specific investment options, other than our common stock, selected by the participant. Distributions under these plans are made in either a lump sum payment or installments. Participants can elect a specific distribution date in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or, if no election is made, the amounts will be distributed upon termination of the participant's employment with us. Distributions are also made in the event of change in control or a participant's death or disability. 
In December 2014, the 2005 NQ Plan was amended, primarily to allow for LTIP Units to be issued in lieu of other deferred compensation upon a distribution event under the plan.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
Notional Account NQDC Plan 
The Notional Account NQDC Plan was adopted in conjunction with the Merger with the purpose of providing the opportunity for certain participants of the AMB NQ Plans to continue to receive tax deferred earnings with respect to taxes on distributions triggered by the Merger. 
Each participant in the AMB NQ Plans who continued to be employed by us after the Merger or continued as a non-employee director after the Merger received an initial account credit in a notional earnings account under the Notional Account NQDC Plan. Mr. Moghadam and Mr. Olinger participate in the Notional Account NQDC Plan. The initial account credit value for a participant was equal to the deemed amount of the tax liability on the distributions they received in 2011 that were triggered by the Merger. The initial account credit value is either invested in our common stock or hypothetically invested in measurement funds selected by the participant, which do not include our common stock. Measurement funds are used for measurement purposes only and plan participants do not have rights in or to the underlying hypothetical investments. 
A notional earnings account is credited with hypothetical earnings or charged with hypothetical losses associated with the underlying hypothetical investments in measurement funds. Upon a distribution event under the plan, the participant is entitled to the excess, if any, of the value in the notional earnings account (representing the value of the initial account credit plus cumulative earnings or losses associated with the underlying hypothetical investments, if any) over the initial account credit value. 
Mr. Moghadam's initial account credit value was in the amount of $25,798,616. A rabbi trust was created to hold shares of our common stock and cash in the amount of Mr. Moghadam's initial account credit balance. We issued 803,945 shares of our common stock to the rabbi trust representing Mr. Moghadam's initial account credit value. The number of shares was determined based on the price of our common stock at the time, $32.09 per share. Mr. Moghadam is entitled to direct the voting of these shares and, as such, they are reflected as beneficially owned by him in the stock ownership table presented below. Mr. Moghadam is not entitled to receive these shares upon distribution of his notional earnings account under the plan. Upon a distribution event under the plan, Mr. Moghadam is entitled to the excess, if any, of the value in the notional earnings account (representing the value of the initial account credit plus cumulative earnings or losses associated with the underlying common stock, if any) over the initial account credit value. 
Mr. Olinger's initial account credit value was hypothetically invested in measurement funds selected by him. The initial account credit value for Mr. Olinger was $122,697. 
In December 2014, the Notional Account NQDC Plan was amended, primarily to allow for LTIP Units to be issued in lieu of other deferred compensation upon a distribution event under the plan.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
We have change in control and noncompetition agreements (the "CIC Agreements") with our NEOs. The CIC Agreements are subject to automatic one-year extensions. Some form of severance benefits (cash payments and/or acceleration of vesting of unvested equity awards) are provided to our NEOs for: (i) in the CIC Agreements; (ii) under the equity award agreements; or (iii) under the terms of POP. These benefits are available under the following scenarios: (1) death; (2) disability; (3) retirement (as defined and under certain circumstances); and (4) termination without cause or termination by employee for good reason within two years of a change in control (as defined). 
In the event of a change in control, the CIC Agreements provide for severance benefits on a "double-trigger" basis with severance benefits payable only upon termination of employment (which is, generally, termination without cause or termination by employee for good reason as such term is defined in the CIC Agreements), within two years following the change in control. Under the CIC Agreements, in consideration for the rights to receive such severance payments, the NEO is subject to confidentiality obligations during employment and after termination, non-competition obligations during the term of employment and non-solicitation obligations for two years after the date of termination. A change of control, as defined in the CIC Agreements, generally occurs upon: (i) the consummation of a transaction, approved by our stockholders, to merge or consolidate the company with another entity, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or adopt a plan of liquidation; provided, however, that a change in control shall not occur if a transaction results in 50% or more of the beneficial ownership of the voting power of the company or other relevant entity being held by the same persons (although not necessarily in the same proportion) who held the voting power of the company immediately prior to the transaction (except that upon the completion of the transaction, employees or employee benefit plans of the company may be a new holder of such beneficial ownership); (ii) the beneficial ownership of securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the company is acquired, other than from the company, by any person (with certain exceptions); or (iii) at any time during any period of two consecutive years, board members at the beginning of such period cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board (unless the election or the nomination for election of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors still in office at the time of such election or nomination who were directors at the beginning of such period). 
Potential payments due to the NEOs under the scenarios listed above are presented in the table below based on the assumption that a termination occurred as of December 31, 2018. The acceleration of vesting of unvested equity awards benefit is estimated using the closing stock price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 of $58.72 per share. Under our company policy, each of our employees would be paid for their earned and unused vacation benefits upon termination under any termination scenario, so the value of this benefit is not included in the amounts below. Because the termination scenarios are as of December 31, 2018, the NEOs would have completed the performance year such that they would receive their annual bonus and their annual long-term equity incentive award for the 2018 performance year. Therefore, these payments are not considered to be severance benefits and such amounts are not included in the amounts presented.

(1)  Cause is generally defined in the CIC Agreements as: (i) the willful and continued failure by  the executive to substantially perform specified duties; (ii) the engaging in conduct that is demonstrably injurious to the company (monetarily or otherwise); or (iii) the engaging in egregious misconduct involving serious moral turpitude.  Termination by employee for good reason, as generally defined in the CIC Agreements, can occur should we: (i) change the executive's duties such that they are inconsistent with the position held prior to the change in control and

(2)  Under the death and disability scenarios contained in the CIC Agreements, the NEO would receive a  cash severance payment equal to his annual base salary plus the annual bonus amount that he received or was entitled to receive for the most recent annual period (target level for 2018) less amounts that would be paid to the executive from other  company benefits. The starting amount under each scenario ($2,500,000 for Mr. Moghadam and $1,350,000 for each of the other NEOs) is based on the executive's annual base salary as of December 31, 2018 ($1,000,000 for Mr. Moghadam  and $600,000 for each of the other NEOs) and the executive's annual bonus at target for 2018 ($1,500,000 for Mr. Moghadam and $750,000 for each of the other NEOs). Under the death scenario, each executive's severance payment has been  reduced by $1,000,000, which is the approximate present value of the life insurance benefit provided by the company. The life insurance benefit provided by the company is two times base salary with a limit of $1,000,000. Under the disability  scenario, the starting amount is the same as under the death scenario and each executive's severance payment has been reduced to zero based on the expected present value of future disability benefits that the executive would receive that are  provided and funded by the company. The annual disability benefit provided by the company is 60% of base salary subject to a maximum of $204,000 per year. For this purpose, it is assumed that the present value of the future annual disability  benefits to be received will be in excess of the payments required under the CIC Agreements. Under the change in control scenario, the NEO would receive cash severance equal to two times his annual base salary and two times his annual bonus (at  target) for the current year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  In the change in control scenario contained in the CIC Agreements, the NEO would receive a cash  payment equal to the cost of continuation of health insurance coverage in place at the date of termination for 24 months. Additionally, the CIC Agreements provide for the payment of an amount equal to two times the company's matching  contribution under the 401(k) Plan ($16,800) and for outplacement services for one year with an estimated value of $25,000.  
[END TABLE]

(4)  The CIC Agreements provide for the reduction of any payments to which the NEO is entitled after a  change in control should such payments constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code). Such payments shall be either (a) reduced (but not below zero) so that the aggregate present value  of the payment shall be $1.00 less than three times the officer's "base amount" (also as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code) so that no portion of the payment will be subject to the excise tax imposed by  Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or (b) paid in full, whichever produces the better net after-tax result for the NEO (taking into account any applicable excise tax under Section 4999  and any applicable income taxes). Under the scenarios for 2018, none of the NEOs would receive a better net after-tax result with a reduction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  The estimates for each scenario reflect the value that would be realized as of December 31,  2018 as a result of accelerated vesting of earned but unvested stock awards, LTIP Units and POP LTIP Units. Values are included to the extent that vesting would be accelerated under the applicable scenario under the terms of the applicable  agreements. All stock options held by the NEOs are vested so no additional value is realized under any scenario related to stock options. For each scenario, the value attributable to stock awards is computed based on the closing price of our common  stock on December 31, 2018 ($58.72).  
[END TABLE]
Under the death and disability scenarios, awards under POP would not be paid until the end of the applicable performance period and the actual awards paid would be based on performance for the entire performance period. Under these scenarios, the value of the POP Allocation to each NEO (and the POP LTIP Units exchanged for such POP Allocations) for the 2017-2019 performance period and 2018-2020 performance period is computed as of December 31, 2018 using estimated compensation pools based on actual performance for the performance period through December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated value of the aggregate compensation pool for these performance periods is $142.1 million for the 2017-2019 performance period and zero for the 2018-2020 performance period. We have included values based on these estimated amounts assuming that applicable performance hurdles will be met at the applicable measurement dates. 
As of December 31, 2018, the value of the aggregate compensation pool for the 2016-2018 performance period is $115.0 million. Awards for the 2016-2018 performance period were determined by the Compensation Committee on January 9, 2019. The portion of that award that vested immediately in January 2019 is excluded from the death, disability, and change in control calculations (as the participant would have been paid this portion regardless of death, disability or a change in control). The portion of the award that is subject to seven year cliff vesting or performance hurdles (which have not yet been met) are included in the death, disability and change in control calculations, assuming that such performance hurdles are met. 
Under the change in control scenario, the Compensation Committee would determine the size of the compensation pool and pay awards according to the applicable POP agreements. Under this scenario, the value of the POP Allocations allocated to each NEO (and the POP LTIP Units exchanged for such POP Allocations) for the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance periods is computed consistently with the value applicable to the death and disability scenarios (assuming that, upon a change in control, the Compensation Committee awards the full estimated value of the compensation pools (assuming all applicable performance hurdles are met) as of December 31, 2018). As we are including amounts that are contingent upon future performance, there is no assurance that these estimates will be realized.

(6)  Any applicable retirement benefit with respect to equity compensation has been waived by our NEOs.  Therefore, no acceleration benefit is reported for a retirement scenario except as stated below with respect to Mr. Moghadam.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  Mr. Moghadam had 221,319 shares for which retirement eligibility had not been waived.  Therefore, the vesting of these shares would accelerate under the retirement scenario on December 31, 2018. The value attributable to these shares is $12,995,852 based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018 ($58.72).

CEO Pay Ratio 
CEO Pay Ratio 
We provide fair and equitable compensation to our employees through a combination of competitive base pay, incentives, retirement plans and other benefits. As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Moghadam: 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    the annual total compensation of the employee identified at the median of our company as of  December 31, 2018 (other than the CEO) was $115,368; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included  in this Proxy Statement, was $28,201,400.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 244 to 1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
Pay ratios within our industry will also differ and may not be comparable depending on the size, scope, global breadth and structure of the company. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    To identify the median employee, we calculated compensation of our employees using their 2018  annual base salaries, bonuses for the 2018 performance year (including any bonus exchange premium received), annual LTI equity awards paid in 2018, value of POP Allocations for the 2018-2020 performance period, PPP awards paid in 2018 and company  contributions to applicable retirement plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We identified our median compensated employee as of December 31, 2018 and as of that date,  our employee population consisted of 1,617 individuals. The total number of U.S. and non-U.S. employees were 878 and 739, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We did not exclude any employees from our employee population. We excluded a limited number of  temporary agency employees, whose compensation is determined by the agency and who are not considered our employees for purposes of the pay ratio calculation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    We annualized the base pay and cash incentive bonus for 2018 new hires.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Foreign salaries were converted to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2018 exchange rate.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    No cost of living adjustments were utilized in the compensation calculation.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Once the median employee was identified, we calculated the total compensation for our median  employee using the same methodology we used to calculate Mr. Moghadams total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for the Fiscal Year 2018.

Advisory Vote to Approve the Company's Executive Compensation 
Advisory Vote to Approve the Company's Executive Compensation for 2018 (Proposal 2) 
The Dodd-Frank Act allows our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. 
The compensation of our NEOs is discussed above under "Executive Compensation." Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our NEOs, who are critical to our success. Under these programs, our NEOs are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read CD&A for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the compensation of our NEOs for 2018. 
This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation that is described in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the annual meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the company's 2018 executive compensation, as discussed and disclosed in the company's proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Executive Compensation Tables and related narratives." 
You may vote for, vote against or abstain from voting to approve the above resolution on the company's executive compensation for 2018. Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved by the stockholders, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are considered voting power present in person or by proxy and thus will have the same effect as votes cast "Against" the proposal. 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the company. However, the Compensation Committee values the opinions of our stockholders and reviews and considers the voting results when making executive compensation decisions. The company currently intends to hold an advisory vote on its executive compensation on an annual basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Board  unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, "FOR" the approval of our 2018 executive compensation, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and  Exchange Commission.

Director Compensation 
Director Compensation 
Non-employee directors are compensated with a mix of cash and equity-based compensation, with a higher percentage of the overall mix in equity-based compensation. An employee who also serves as a member of the Board, such as Mr. Moghadam, does not receive additional compensation for service on the Board. 
In May 2018, FW Cook conducted a competitive review of our non-employee director compensation to ensure that our compensation levels are competitive and the structure of the program is consistent with corporate governance best practices. The Compensation Committee has targeted our non-employee director compensation at the 75th percentile of the S&P 500, but not to exceed the 90th percentile of a comparison group of 10 large-cap REITs. These REITs are the same companies that are in the comparison group that is used to evaluate executive compensation and are listed above under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The targeted percentiles are reflective of our overall size, scope and breadth of our business, which approximates the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 and exceeds that of most of the companies in the comparison group. 
FW Cook's review found that (i) our non-employee director compensation is near the 75th percentile of the comparison group and near the median of the S&P 500, assuming a 5% increase from 2017 compensation levels for the comparison group and the S&P 500 and (ii) the mix between the cash and equity components of our non-employee director compensation (40% in cash and 60% in equity) was consistent with median competitive practice of both the comparison group and the S&P 500. 
FW Cook's analysis supported an increase in director compensation to target compensation closer to the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 (not to exceed the 90th percentile of the comparison group). As a result, the Compensation Committee recommended an increase of $10,000 to the director annual cash retainer and $25,000 to the director annual equity grant, which maintains the mix of 40% in cash and 60% in equity consistent with median competitive practice. The recommendations were approved by the full Board. 
Compensation applicable to service on the Board by our non-employee directors for 2018 (starting in July 2018) was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Annual cash retainer: $120,000  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Annual equity awards: Valued on the grant date at $190,000

  ■    Excess meeting fee: Meeting fee of $1,500 for each meeting attended in excess of a combined  20 Board and committee meetings per year.  
[END TABLE]
The equity component of the compensation paid to our directors is awarded under the terms of the 2012 LTIP. See the narrative discussion that follows the Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year 2018 table above under "Executive Compensation." In addition, we reimburse our directors for reasonable travel costs incurred to attend the meetings of the Board and its committees.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans for Directors 
2012 NQDC Plan and AMB NQ Plans 
Messrs. Fotiades, Losh and Webb elected to defer receipt of their annual retainers and other fees earned, as applicable, in 2018. The compensation earned by these directors has been converted into phantom shares in a hypothetical fee deferral account, under the terms of the 2012 NQDC Plan. The footnotes to the Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table below contain information on the amount of deferrals applicable to these directors. 
In 2012, Mr. Fotiades deferred his annual cash retainer into a cash account under the 2012 NQDC Plan. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Fotiades' balance in the cash account under the 2012 NQDC Plan was $168,940, including losses in 2018 of $9,705. 
See discussion of our deferred compensation plans in the narrative that follows the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018 table above under "Executive Compensation." 
Notional Account NQDC Plan 
Under the Notional Account NQDC Plan, Mr. Losh and Ms. Kennard received an initial account credit value in a notional earnings account equal to the amount of the deemed tax liability on the distributions they received in 2011 triggered by the Merger. The initial account credit value is hypothetically invested in measurement funds selected by the participant, which do not include our company stock. Measurement funds are used for measurement purposes only and plan participants do not have rights in or to the underlying hypothetical investments. Notional earnings accounts are credited with hypothetical earnings or charged with hypothetical losses associated with the underlying hypothetical investments. Upon their retirement from the Board, Mr. Losh and Ms. Kennard are entitled to the excess, if any, of the value in their notional earnings account (representing the value of the initial account credit plus cumulative earnings or losses associated with the underlying hypothetical investments, if any) over their initial account credit value. 
The initial account credit values for Mr. Losh and Ms. Kennard were $469,558 and $98,047, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the value of the notional earnings account exceeded the initial account credit value for Mr. Losh by $453,433, including a decrease attributable to 2018 of $43,168, and for Ms. Kennard by $25,081, including a decrease attributable to 2018 of $7,992. 
See discussion of our deferred compensation plans in the narrative that follows the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018 table above under "Executive Compensation." 
ProLogis Deferred Fee Plan for Trustees 
This plan, which was assumed by us in the Merger, allowed members of the Trust's board to receive their fees currently or elect to defer the receipt of their fees until after their board service ended. Deferrals were in the form of cash or Trust common shares. For those choosing shares, fees earned were credited to hypothetical fee deferral accounts based on the closing price of the common shares as of the date of the deferral. Under the Merger agreement, the Trust common shares in the deferral account were converted to our common stock using the Merger exchange ratio. Each share in the hypothetical account represents one share of our common stock and earns dividends under the same terms as dividends paid on our common stock. Upon retirement from the Board, the participant will be issued the shares of common stock included in their hypothetical fee deferral account pursuant to specific deferral elections, which generally delay payment until the next fiscal year after service on the Board ends. No additional deferrals could be made under this plan after December 31, 2011.

Mr. Fotiades participated in this plan at the time of the Merger. As of December 31, 2018, including amounts earned as dividends, Mr. Fotiades had a balance of 23,895 shares in his hypothetical fee deferral account. 
Mr. Lyons and Mr. Zollars have hypothetical fee deferral accounts associated with prior service on the Trust's board but were not participants in this plan at the time of the Merger. Mr. Lyons' balance (255 shares as of December 31, 2018) is being distributed to him in five annual installments that began in 2015. Mr. Zollars' balance (1,552 shares as of December 31, 2018) is being distributed to him in ten annual installments through 2020.

Under this plan, the  cash compensation is converted into phantom shares that are held in a hypothetical fee deferral account under the terms of the 2012 NQDC Plan. As of December 31, 2018, the balance in the hypothetical fee deferral accounts under the 2012 NQDC  Plan (which also includes deferrals prior to 2018) and the years in which the deferral was elected were as follows:  
[END TABLE]

The value of the DSUs is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant which was $64.75 per share. The DSUs  vest on the earlier of the date of our next annual meeting or the one-year anniversary of the grant date. These awards are expected to vest on May 1, 2019, the date of our 2019 annual meeting. Receipt of  the vested DSUs is deferred until three years from the grant date. Messrs. Fotiades, Losh, Lyons and O'Connor have elected to further defer the receipt of the DSUs granted in 2018 until their service on the Board ends. While they are  outstanding, DSUs earn DEUs, which are vested and paid to the director under the same terms as the underlying DSU award.

We awarded DSUs under similar terms to our directors in 2015, which were distributed (3,651 shares) in April 2018 to all directors other than Messrs. Fotiades, Losh and Lyons, each of whom had previously elected to defer receipt under our 2012 NQDC Plan, and Messrs. Hawkins and Piani and Ms. Bita who were not members of the Board in 2015. Awards granted in 2016 and 2017 are now fully vested and are scheduled to be distributed in May 2019 and May 2020, respectively, unless a specific deferral election has been made by the director. 
Prior to the Merger, we granted restricted stock to our directors, and the Trust granted DSUs to members of its board. The restricted stock had a one-year vesting period and directors could elect to defer the awards after vesting under the AMB NQ Plans discussed above. The DSUs granted by the Trust were immediately vested but were required to be deferred until after the director's service ended. The DSUs held by

Audit Committee Report 
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to be an informed, vigilant and effective overseer of our financial accounting and reporting processes consistent with risk mitigation appropriate in the circumstances. The committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. The committee is comprised of the five directors named below. Each member of the committee is independent as defined by SEC and NYSE rules. In addition, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an audit committee financial expert and is financially literate in accordance with applicable NYSE and SEC rules. Management is responsible for the company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the company's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), and issuing reports thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities. The committee's function is more fully described in its charter which has been approved by the Board. The charter can be viewed, together with any future changes, on our website at http://ir.prologis.com/governance. 
We have reviewed and discussed the company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and unaudited financial statements for the quarterly periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2018 with management and KPMG LLP, the company's independent registered public accounting firm. We also reviewed and discussed management's assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. The committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters that are required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communication With Audit Committees, issued by the PCAOB. KPMG LLP has provided to the company the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable PCAOB requirements regarding their communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. The committee also concluded that KPMG LLP's performance of non-audit services to us and our affiliates, as pre-approved by the committee and described in the next section, does not impair KPMG LLP's independence. 
Based on the considerations referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018. The foregoing report is provided by the following independent directors, who constitute the committee.

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee engaged KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. KPMG LLP was also retained to provide certain audit-related and tax services in 2018 and 2017. 
In the course of the provision of services on our behalf, we recognize the importance of our independent registered public accounting firm's ability to maintain objectivity and independence in its audit of our financial statements and the importance of minimizing any relationships that could appear to impair that objectivity. To that end, the Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures governing the pre-approval of audit and non-audit work performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm is

Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Proposal 3) 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit our financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019. KPMG LLP has been our external auditors since 2002. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the company's retention of KPMG LLP. In order to ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. In conjunction with the mandated rotation of KPMG LLP's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of KPMG LLP's new lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the company and our stockholders. 
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019. In the event our stockholders do not approve the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. 
KPMG LLP representatives are expected to attend the 2019 annual meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. 
You may vote for, vote against, or abstain from voting on ratifying the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019. Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved by the stockholders, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock having voting power present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are considered voting power present in person or by proxy and thus will have the same effect as votes cast "Against" the proposal. 
The Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019.

Proxy Materials and Voting Information 
Proxy and Annual Meeting FAQ 
Proxy materials 
We are required under SEC regulations to provide you with a proxy statement when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is a legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own, which person is also referred to as your "proxy." This designation may be done in a written document that is called a "proxy" or "proxy card." 
The proxy materials consist of our 2019 Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, which includes our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Your vote is very important. For this reason, our Board is requesting that you permit your common stock to be represented and voted at the annual meeting by the proxies named on the proxy card. 
Notice of Internet Availability 
We have implemented the Notice and Access Rule enacted by the SEC for distribution of materials for our annual meeting. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability to many of our stockholders of record and our beneficial owners. All stockholders will be able to access the proxy materials. We believe that the electronic availability of materials is an appropriate proxy communication solution that will allow us to provide our stockholders with the materials they need, while lowering the cost of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meetings. Stockholders may request to receive printed copies of the proxy materials. 
Distribution of proxy materials 
On or about March 22, 2019, the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability") will be distributed to many of our stockholders, either in printed form by mail or electronically by email, in lieu of mailing the printed proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability instructs stockholders as to how they may: (i) access and review all of the proxy materials through the Internet; (ii) submit their proxy; and (iii) receive printed proxy materials. Also on or about March 22, 2019, printed proxy materials, including our 2019 Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, will be mailed to all other stockholders, as requested or required. On the mailing date, all stockholders and beneficial owners will have the ability to access all of the proxy materials on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or http://ir.prologis.com/annuals.cfm. 
Stockholders may request to receive proxy materials electronically by email on an ongoing basis by selecting the link "Consent for Electronic Delivery" at http://ir.prologis.com/annual-reports. You can also sign up for electronic delivery of proxy materials by following the instructions on the proxy card and Notice of Internet Availability with respect to how to vote using the Internet and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access proxy materials electronically in future years. If you register to receive future proxy materials electronically by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions on how to access those proxy materials and how to vote. If you change your

Additional Information email address, you will need to update your registration. Your election on how to receive proxy materials will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
Stockholders will receive printed copies of the proxy materials if they have elected this form of delivery or they are participants in our 401(k) Plan. Printed copies of the proxy materials will be provided upon request at no charge by submitting a written notice to Investor Relations, Prologis, Inc., Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. 
Voting in person at the annual meeting 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and a Notice of Internet Availability or printed proxy materials and a proxy card are being sent directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to vote in person at the annual meeting. If you choose to vote in person at the annual meeting, you can bring the proxy card mailed to you if you received printed proxy materials, or you can vote using a ballot that will be provided to you at the annual meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we recommend that you authorize your proxy to vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted should you later decide not to attend the annual meeting. 
Most of our stockholders hold their shares in street name through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. In this case, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and a Notice of Internet Availability or printed proxy materials are being forwarded to you together with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend the annual meeting. However, because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the annual meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank, trustee, or nominee that holds your shares, which will give you the right to vote the shares at the annual meeting. You will need to contact your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee to obtain a legal proxy. You will need to bring that legal proxy to the annual meeting in order to vote in person. 
Voting without attending the annual meeting 
Whether you hold shares directly as a stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct your vote without attending the annual meeting. You may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee. In most cases, you will be able to do this by telephone, through the Internet, or by mail. If you are a stockholder of record, please refer to the summary instructions on the proxy card included with your proxy materials or the instructions on how to vote contained in the Notice of Internet Availability. If you hold your shares in street name, the voting instructions will be communicated to you by your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee. The Notice of Internet Availability also provides instructions on how you can request a printed copy of the proxy materials and proxy card, if you desire. 
By Telephone or through the Internet—If you have telephone or Internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions included with your proxy materials or, if you requested a printed copy of the proxy materials, on the proxy card. If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as you have instructed. 
By Mail—If you requested a printed copy of the proxy materials, you may submit your proxy by mail by signing the proxy card or, for shares held in street name, by following the voting instruction card included by your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee and mailing it in the postage-paid envelope that is included. If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as you have instructed. 
The telephone and Internet proxy voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April 30, 2019, unless the meeting is postponed or adjourned, in which case such voting facilities may remain open or be reopened until the day before the postponed or adjourned meeting.

[END TABLE]
Additional Information 
The availability of telephone and Internet voting for beneficial owners will depend on the voting processes of your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee. Therefore, we recommend that you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive from your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee. 
If you vote by telephone or through the Internet, you do not have to return a proxy card or voting instruction card. 
The telephone and Internet proxy voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by use of a control number and to allow stockholders to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. The method by which you vote will in no way limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you later decide to attend the annual meeting in person. 
Changing your vote 
You may revoke your proxy at any time and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the annual meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may do this by signing and submitting a written notice to Edward S. Nekritz, Secretary, Prologis, Inc., Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111, by submitting a new proxy card with a later date, by voting again by telephone or through the Internet (your latest telephone or Internet proxy is counted), or by attending the annual meeting in person and voting by ballot at the annual meeting. If you hold your shares beneficially in street name, you will need to contact your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee to determine the process for revoking a voting instruction. Merely attending the annual meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you specifically request your proxy to be revoked. 
All shares that have been properly voted (for which proxies have not been revoked) will be voted at the annual meeting. 
Specific voting instructions not given 
If you hold your shares directly in your name, and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, the shares of common stock represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board. If you hold your shares in street name through a broker, bank, trustee, or nominee and you do not provide specific voting instructions, your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee will have discretion to vote such shares but only with respect to routine matters (Proposal 3). 
If no voting instructions are received from you, and you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank, trustee or nominee will not turn in a proxy card for your shares on the non-routine matters proposed at our annual meeting. Non-routine matters are the election of directors (Proposal 1) and the advisory vote to approve the company's executive compensation for 2018 (Proposal 2). 
If you hold shares in your 401(k) Plan account and do not provide the trustee of the 401(k) Plan with specific voting instructions, the trustee will vote all uninstructed shares held in our 401(k) Plan in the same proportion as how instructed shares held in the 401(k) Plan are voted. 
Vote required for proposals 
Vote Required for Proposal 1 (Election of Directors): You may vote for, vote against or abstain from voting for any of the director nominees. Assuming a quorum is present, to elect a particular director nominee, the number of votes cast "For" a director nominee must exceed the number of such votes cast "Against" the director nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the election. A more detailed description of these majority voting procedures is provided below under "Majority Voting."

Additional Information 
Vote Required for Proposal 2 (Advisory Vote to Approve the Company's Executive Compensation for 2018): You may vote for, vote against or abstain from voting for the resolution on the company's executive compensation for 2018. Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved by the stockholders, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are considered shares present in person or by proxy and thus will have the same effect as votes cast "Against" the proposal. 
Vote Required for Proposal 3 (Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Accounting Firm): You may vote for, vote against or abstain from voting on ratifying the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019. Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved by the stockholders, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are considered shares present in person or by proxy and thus will have the same effect as votes cast "Against" the proposal. 
Proxy solicitation 
We pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by our directors, officers, or employees, in person or by telephone, facsimile, or other electronic means. These people will not be specially compensated for their solicitation of proxies. 
In accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and NYSE, we will also reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares of our common stock. 
NO PERSON IS AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR TO MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND, IF GIVEN OR MADE, SUCH INFORMATION MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED. THE DELIVERY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT SHALL, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, CREATE ANY IMPLICATION THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE AFFAIRS OF PROLOGIS, INC. SINCE THE DATE OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 
Admission to the annual meeting 
Stockholders must bring proof of current ownership of our common stock to be admitted to and to attend the 2019 annual meeting.

Additional Information 
Who can vote 
Each issued and outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the annual meeting. Holders of record of Prologis common stock at the close of business on the record date, March 6, 2019, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. As of March 6, 2019, there were 630,700,214 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
Quorum requirement 
There is no right to cumulative voting. A quorum is met if a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date are represented, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting. Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you are present and entitled to vote in person at the meeting, if you have properly submitted a proxy card, or if you authorize your proxy to vote your shares by telephone or through the Internet. 
If you are present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy, but you abstain from voting on any or all proposals, your shares are still counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Broker non-votes are also counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares of our common stock for a beneficial owner is present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote, but does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions on how to vote with respect to that item from the beneficial owner. 
Majority voting 
Our bylaws provide that the vote required for election of directors is a "majority vote of the votes cast" in uncontested elections of directors. Accordingly, directors are required to be elected by the majority of votes cast by the shares present in person or represented by proxy with respect to such director in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "For" a director nominee by the holders of shares of common stock entitled to vote on the election of directors and represented in person or by proxy at the annual meeting must exceed the number of such shares voted "Against" the director nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. 
In a contested election (where a determination is made that the number of director nominees is expected to exceed the number of directors to be elected at a meeting), the vote standard will be a plurality of the votes cast with respect to such director. In the event of a contested election where the plurality vote standard applies, stockholders shall be permitted to vote only "for" a director nominee or to designate their vote be "withheld" from such nominee. 
If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected by a majority vote at the annual meeting, then, under Maryland law, such director would continue to serve as a "holdover director." Under our bylaws, any director who fails to be elected by a majority vote shall tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will then act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of election results. If the resignation is not accepted, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until the director's successor is duly elected and qualified. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's decision. Non-incumbent directors who are not elected at the annual meeting would not become directors and would not serve on the Board as a "holdover director."

Additional Information 
Proxy access 
In 2016, we adopted proxy access with a "3/3/20/20" market standard. The amendment and restatement of our bylaws provides that, subject to certain requirements, a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning three percent or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, can require us to include in our annual meeting proxy materials director nominations for up to 20% of the number of directors, or two directors, whichever is greater. Proxy access rights are subject to additional eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements set forth in our bylaws. 
Stockholder recommended nominees for director 
The Governance Committee will evaluate nominees for director recommended by stockholders against the same criteria that it uses to evaluate other director nominees, as described under "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance—Director Qualifications, Skills and Experience." The committee will consider nominees to the Board recommended by stockholders with respect to elections to be held at an annual meeting if notice of the nomination is timely delivered in writing to our secretary prior to the meeting. See "Submitting Stockholder Proposals" for notice requirements prescribed by our Bylaws. 
Additional matters present at the annual meeting 
We do not anticipate any other business to be brought before the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. In addition to the scheduled items, however, the meeting may consider properly presented stockholder proposals and matters relating to the conduct of the meeting. As to any other business, the proxies, in their discretion, are authorized to vote on other matters that may properly come before the meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. 
Submitting Stockholder Proposals 
There are no stockholder proposals for consideration at the 2019 annual meeting. You may submit proposals, including director nominations, for consideration at our next annual meeting expected to be held in 2019 as follows: 
Deadline for submitting stockholder proposals for inclusion in our 2020 proxy statement.

Please refer to our annual and quarterly financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other public reports for further information about us and our business. 
Annualized TSR is calculated based on the stock price appreciation and dividends paid to show a total return to a stockholder over a period of time. This calculation assumes dividends are reinvested into the stock on the day the dividend is paid. We annualize TSR by converting the total return of the stock at the end of a prescribed time period to an annualized basis. 
Asset Management Fees represents the third-party share of asset management and transactional fees from both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
Assets Under Management ("AUM") represents the estimated fair value of the real estate we own or manage through both our consolidated and unconsolidated entities. We calculate AUM by adding Investment Capacity and the third-party investors' share of the estimated fair value of the assets in the co-investment ventures to our share of total market capitalization (calculated as market equity plus our share of total debt). 
BREEAM, also referred to as Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method, is a certification process to assess building sustainability.

Appendix A: Definitions and Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Estimated Weighted Average Margin is calculated on developed properties as the Value Creation less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by the TEI. 
The FTSE4Good Index Series is designed to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong ESG practices. 
Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders and unitholders ("FFO"). FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. 
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT" or "Nareit") defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures. 
Our FFO Measures. Our FFO measures begin with NAREIT's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis, and Core FFO, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook. 
We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity-by-entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests' share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods. 
These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs. 
We analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. 
FFO, as modified by Prologis attributable, to common stockholders and unitholders ("FFO, as modified by Prologis"). 
To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT-defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency-related items and deferred tax, specifically: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax  liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us  and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
We use FFO, as modified by Prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
Core FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders ("Core FFO"). In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with  the intent to contribute or sell;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition  costs related to the acquisition of real estate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of  our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred  stock; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    expenses related to natural disasters.  
[END TABLE]
We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. 
Limitations on the use of our FFO measures. While we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT's nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our modified FFO  measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO.  FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating  performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    Gains or losses from non-development property and  dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in  market conditions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures  result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures  are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are  limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our Core FFO may provide a  benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ■    The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP as follows (in millions).

GRI (formerly the "Global Reporting Institute") Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. 
Hauté Qualite Environmentale ("HQE") is a sustainability certification that can be earned by building construction, management and urban planning projects in France. 
Investment Capacity is our estimate of the gross real estate, which could be acquired by our co-investment ventures through the use of existing equity commitments from us and our partners assuming the ventures' maximum leverage limits are used. 
LEED. The U.S. Green Building Council ("USGBC") established the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ("LEED") rating system to assess buildings against key sustainability standards. 
LED lighting. LED stands for "light-emitting diode." LED lighting is a type of energy efficient lighting. 
LEED Volume Program streamlines the LEED certification process for high volume property owners. 
Liquidity is equal to the sum of the current availability of our consolidated credit facilities ($3.4 billion) plus our consolidated cash and cash equivalents ($0.3 billion). 
Loan-to-Market Value, or debt as a percentage of gross market capitalization, is a non-GAAP measure used by us to analyze the leverage risk in our debt risk portfolio. We make adjustments to reflect our economic ownership in each entity in which we invest, whether consolidated or unconsolidated. The following table presents the calculation of Loan-to-Market Value for the years ended December 31 (in thousands).

(2)  We exclude non-industrial real estate properties and  properties held for sale, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the reporting period or properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation  fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. Net  termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to  straight-line rents over the lease term.

(3)  Rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes,  insurance and utilities. In addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On  consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. These expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same  store portfolio and any adjustment is included as "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in this table.
