PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL MEETING 
Information About the Proxy Materials 
The board of directors of InvenTrust Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation (referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), is furnishing the enclosed Notice of Annual Meeting, proxy statement and proxy card to you, and to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2019, because the board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has adopted rules permitting the electronic delivery of proxy materials. In accordance with those rules, we are primarily furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders via the Internet, rather than mailing paper copies of the materials. Internet distribution of the proxy materials is designed to expedite receipt by stockholders and lower costs of the Annual Meeting. Beginning on or about March 11, 2019, we will mail a Notice of Annual Meeting and Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders as of the close of business on March 1, 2019, which contained instructions on how to access and review proxy materials, including our proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and how to submit proxies via the Internet or by telephone. If you received a Notice but would like to submit your proxy by mail or request paper copies of our proxy materials going forward, you may still do so by following the instructions described in the Notice. 
Choosing to receive your proxy materials over the Internet will help reduce the costs associated with the printing and mailing of the proxy materials to you. Unless you affirmatively elect to receive paper copies of our proxy materials in the future by following the instructions included in the Notice, you will continue to receive a Notice directing you to a website for electronic access to our proxy materials. 
On or about March 11, 2019, we also began mailing a full set of proxy materials to certain stockholders who previously requested a paper copy of the proxy materials. 
If you own shares of common stock in more than one account, such as individually or jointly with your spouse, you may receive more than one Notice or set of these materials. Please make sure to authorize a proxy to vote all of your shares. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on May 9, 2019. This proxy statement, the proxy card and our annual report on Form 10-K to stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
Information About the Annual Meeting 
The Annual Meeting will be held on May 9, 2019, beginning at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, at Chicago Marriott Oak Brook, 1401 West 22nd Street, Oak Brook, IL 60523. We welcome your attendance at the meeting. Please note that only stockholders as of March 1, 2019 (the record date) or the holders of their valid proxies will be permitted to attend. If you plan to attend the meeting in person, please bring: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a valid governmental-issued picture identification, such as a driver's license or a passport, which is  required before being admitted to the meeting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you hold shares through a broker or nominee (i.e., in "street name" as further described below under  the heading "Information about Voting – Beneficial Owners"), proof of your beneficial ownership as of March 1, 2019, such as a brokerage statement showing your ownership as of that date or a "legal proxy" authorizing  you to vote such shares; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if you are a representative of a corporate or institutional stockholder, proof that you are a representative of  such stockholder.  
[END TABLE]
Please contact Mr. Dan Lombardo, Investor Relations, at 630-570-0605 with any questions you have about attending the meeting, including requests for directions or other guidelines regarding admission to the meeting. 
Information About Voting 
Your presence in person or by proxy is needed to ensure that the proposals can be acted upon. We are a widely held company, and no large affiliated groups of stockholders own substantial blocks of our shares. As a result, a large number of our stockholders must be present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order for us to obtain a quorum. THEREFORE, YOUR PRESENCE IN PERSON OR BY PROXY IS VERY IMPORTANT, EVEN IF YOU OWN A SMALL NUMBER OF SHARES. Your immediate response will save us significant additional expense associated with soliciting stockholder votes and will help avoid potential delays and prevent repeated calls to you from our proxy solicitors. 
You will have one vote for each share of common stock that you owned at the close of business on March 1, 2019, which is the record date for the Annual Meeting. As of March 1, 2019, there were 728,558,989 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. There is no cumulative voting. 
Record Holders 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, DST Systems, Inc., you are, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record or record holder. Record holders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by granting us a proxy to vote on each of the proposals. You may authorize a proxy to vote your shares in any of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by mail: if you received a hard copy proxy card, you may complete and return it as instructed on the proxy  card. If you received a Notice, you may request a proxy card at any time by following the instructions on the Notice. You may then complete the proxy card and return it by mail as instructed on the proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• via telephone: dial 1-800-690-6903 any time prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2019, and with your Notice in hand follow the instructions; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• via the Internet: go to www.proxyvote.com any time prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 8, 2019,  and with your Notice in hand follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
If you are a record holder and grant a proxy, you may nevertheless revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by: (1) sending written notice to us, 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, Attention: Corporate Secretary; (2) providing us with a properly executed, later-dated proxy; or (3) attending the Annual Meeting in person and voting your shares. Merely attending the Annual Meeting, without further action, will not revoke your proxy. 
Beneficial Owners 
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by another nominee, you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and the Notice (or in some cases, a full set of proxy materials) is being forwarded to you automatically, along with instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Your broker, bank or other nominee has provided voting instructions for you to use in directing how to   vote your shares. If you do not provide specific voting instructions by the deadline set forth in the materials you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee can vote your shares with respect to "discretionary" items, but not with respect to "non-discretionary" items. See "Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes" below for more information about broker non-votes. Beneficial owners who desire to revoke a previously submitted proxy should contact their bank or broker for instructions. 
Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting. Please contact your broker, bank or other nominee for information about obtaining a legal proxy. 
Information Regarding Tabulation of the Vote 
Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") or its designee will act as the inspector of election and will count the votes. 
Information About Items to be Voted on and Vote Necessary for Action to be Taken 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the following matters, and such other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof: 
Proposal No. 1: Election of eight directors, to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. A plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting shall be sufficient to elect a director. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the holder is entitled to vote. The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR each of the nominees for director.
Proposal No. 2: Ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. A majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting shall be sufficient to approve Proposal No. 2. The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
If you return your proxy but do not indicate how your shares should be voted, they will be voted "FOR" each director in Proposal No. 1 and "FOR" Proposal No.  2. 
Quorum Requirement 
The presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting on any matter shall constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum present in order for us to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. 
Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
An "abstain" vote with respect to any proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is considered present and entitled to vote with respect to that proposal, but is not considered a vote cast with respect to that proposal. Therefore, an abstention will not have any effect on the outcome of the vote on any proposals, but will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
A "broker non-vote" occurs if your shares are not registered in your name and you do not provide the record holder of your shares (usually a bank, broker, or other nominee) with voting instructions on a matter and the record holder is not permitted to vote on the matter without instructions from you under applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) is considered a "non-discretionary" item, so if you do not provide instructions to the holder of record, your shares will be treated as broker non-votes. The ratification of appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 2) is a "discretionary" or routine item under NYSE rules. As a result, the shares for which instructions are not provided to the holder of record will not be treated as broker non-votes and brokers who do not receive instructions as to how to vote on this matter generally may vote on this matter in their discretion. A   broker non-vote is considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but is not considered a "vote cast" with respect to such matter. Because the election of directors (Proposal No. 1) requires a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, broker non-votes will not have any effect on the election of directors. 
Costs of Soliciting Proxies 
We will bear all costs and expenses incurred in connection with soliciting proxies. Our directors and executive officers may solicit proxies by mail, personal contact, letter, telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. These individuals will not receive any additional compensation for these activities, but may be reimbursed by us for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, Broadridge will solicit proxies on our behalf. We will pay Broadridge fees that we expect will not exceed $150,000 and any out-of-pocket expenses for soliciting proxies. 
Other Matters 
At this time, no other matters are being presented for your consideration at the Annual Meeting. Generally, no business aside from the items discussed in this proxy statement may be transacted at the meeting. If, however, any other matter properly comes before the Annual Meeting as determined by the chairperson of the meeting, your proxies are authorized to act on the proposal at their discretion. 
Householding 
Only one Notice or copy of this proxy statement and the 2018 annual report on Form 10-K have been sent to certain stockholders who share a single address, unless any stockholder residing at that address has given contrary instructions. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces mailing and printing costs. Additional copies of this proxy statement or our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 will be furnished to you, without charge, by writing us at: c/o InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, Attention: Investor Relations, or by telephoning us, toll free, at (855) 377-0510. If you share an address with another stockholder and the two of you would like to receive only a single set of our annual disclosure documents, please contact us by writing us at: c/o InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, Attention: Investor Relations, or by telephoning us, toll free, at (855) 377-0510, or, if a bank, broker or other nominee holds your shares, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee directly.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES 
Director Independence 
Our business is managed under the direction and oversight of our board. The members of our board are Paula J. Saban, our chairperson, Stuart Aitken, Amanda Black, Thomas F. Glavin, Thomas P. McGuinness, Scott A. Nelson, Michael A. Stein and Julian E. Whitehurst. As required by our charter, a majority of our directors must be "independent." As defined by our charter, an "independent director" means any director who qualifies as an "independent director" under the provisions of the NYSE Listed Company Manual in effect from time to time. The NYSE standards provide that to qualify as an independent director, in addition to satisfying certain bright-line criteria, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). 
Consistent with these considerations, after reviewing all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and the Company, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm, and considering each director's direct and indirect association with the Company and its management, the board has determined that Mses. Black and Saban and Messrs. Aitken, Glavin, Nelson, Stein and Whitehurst qualify as independent directors. 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
Mr. McGuinness, in his role as our president and chief executive officer, is responsible for managing the strategic direction and for providing the day-to-day leadership of the Company. Ms. Saban, in her role as our chairperson of the board, organizes the work of the board and ensures that the board has access to sufficient information to carry out its functions, including monitoring the Company's performance. Ms. Saban presides over meetings of the board and stockholders, establishes the agenda for each meeting and oversees the distribution of information to directors. We have separated the roles of the president and chairperson of the board in recognition of the differences between the two roles. Our board believes the current structure is appropriate and effective. 
To ensure free and open discussion and communication among the non-management directors of our board of directors, the non-management directors will meet periodically in private session with no members of management present. Ms. Saban, as our chairperson, presides at these sessions. 
Our board oversees the business and affairs of our Company, including its long-term health, overall success and financial strength. The full board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company. Our board oversees risk through the: (1) review and discussion of regular periodic reports to the board and its committees, including management reports, leasing activity and property operating data, as well as actual and projected financial results, the corporate model and outputs, and various other matters relating to our business; (2) required approval by the board of certain transactions, including, among others, acquisitions and dispositions of properties exceeding certain dollar amounts and financings exceeding certain dollar amounts, as set forth in investment policies adopted by the board; (3) oversight of risk associated with the various elements of compensation by the compensation committee; (4) oversight of risk policies and management as well as major financial risk exposures and steps taken to monitor and control such risks by the audit committee; and (5) review of regular periodic reports from our independent public accounting firm, third-party internal audit firm and other outside consultants regarding various areas of potential risk, including, among others, those relating to the qualification of the Company as a REIT for tax purposes and our internal control over financial reporting. 
Communicating with Directors 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, defined and discussed below under the heading "Corporate Governance Guidelines," anyone who would like to communicate with, or otherwise make his or her concerns known directly to the chairperson of our board of directors, the chairperson of any of the audit, nominating and corporate governance, compensation and executive committees, or to the non-management or independent directors as a group, may do so by (1) addressing such communications or concerns to the Secretary of the Company, InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, who   will forward such communications to the appropriate party, or (2) sending any emails to StockholderCommunications@inventrustproperties.com. Such communications may be done confidentially or anonymously. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee is comprised of Messrs. Aitken, Glavin and Stein, with Mr. Glavin serving as chairperson. 
Each of the current members of the nominating and corporate governance committee is independent, as defined by the rules of the NYSE and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying individuals qualified to become members of our board of directors, including conducting inquiries  into the background and qualifications of any candidate, and recommending and nominating candidates for election to the board at annual meetings of stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing the committee structure of the board of directors and recommending directors to serve as members of  each committee of the board of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• developing and recommending to the board of directors a set of corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics  and, from time to time, reviewing such guidelines and code and recommending changes to the board of directors for approval as necessary; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors.  
[END TABLE]
Our board of directors has adopted a written charter for our nominating and corporate governance committee, which is available on our website at www.inventrustproperties.com through the "Investor Relations – Corporate Governance – Board Committees and Charters" tab. In addition, a printed copy of the charter is available to any stockholder without charge by writing us at InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, Attention: Investor Relations. 
Selection of Director Nominees 
The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of potential director candidates and recommending those candidates to be nominated for election to the board of directors. The nominating and corporate governance committee considers relevant experience, skills and knowledge as well as individual qualifications, including personal and professional integrity, ethics and values; commitments to other businesses; independence, including absence of any personal or professional conflicts of interest; corporate governance experience; financial and accounting background; experience in our industry or familiarity with the issues affecting our business; diversity (including age, gender and ethnic and racial background, viewpoint and experience); academic expertise in an area of our operations; practical and mature business judgment, including ability to make independent analytical inquiries and the extent to which the interplay of the candidate's skills, knowledge and experience with that of other board members will build a board that is effective, collegial and responsive to the needs of the Company. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee screens all potential candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of the recommendation. The review is expected to be based on any written materials provided with respect to potential candidates, and the nominating and corporate governance committee will review the materials to determine the qualifications, experience and background of the candidates. Final candidates are expected to be interviewed by one or more members of the nominating and corporate governance committee. During 2018, the nominating and corporate governance committee retained a search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating potential director candidates and may do so in the future. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Any such recommendations must be submitted in   accordance with the procedures specified in Section 9 of Article II of our bylaws. Generally, this requires that the stockholder send certain information about the candidate to our secretary not later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 120th day and not earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. For our annual meeting to be held in 2020, a stockholder must provide written notice of a candidate recommendation not earlier than October 13, 2019 and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 12, 2019, to our corporate secretary, c/o InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515. The notice must identify the author as a stockholder, provide a brief summary of the candidate's qualifications and include the information required by our bylaws for advance notice of stockholder nominees for director. If the shares of our common stock held by the stockholder making the recommendation are held in "street name," notices should also attach proof of ownership of InvenTrust common stock as of the date of the notice. At a minimum, candidates recommended for nomination to the board of directors must meet the director independence standards of the NYSE. 
Audit Committee 
Our audit committee is comprised of four independent directors, Ms. Black and Messrs. Aitken, Glavin and Stein was established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The board has determined that Mr. Glavin, the chairperson of the committee, and Ms. Black and Mr. Stein each qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as such term is defined by the applicable SEC regulations, and that each member of the committee is independent, as defined by the rules of the NYSE and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the heightened independence standards applicable to audit committee members. The audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of our financial statements;

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This section discusses the principles underlying our policies and decisions with respect to the compensation of our executive officers who are named in the "Summary Compensation Table" below and the principal factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. In 2018, our "named executive officers" ("NEOs") and their positions were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Thomas P. McGuinness, President and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Michael E. Podboy, Former Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer and  Treasurer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ivy Z. Greaner, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Christy L. David, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adam M. Jaworski, Senior Vice President, Interim Principal Financial Officer, Interim Treasurer and Chief  Accounting Officer.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Podboy resigned from his position as an executive officer and all other employee and officer positions that he held with the Company and its subsidiaries effective August 27, 2018. In connection with Mr. Podboy's resignation, the Company and Mr. Podboy entered into a Severance Agreement and General Release, dated as of August 27, 2018 (the "Severance Agreement") as more fully described below under the caption "Severance Agreement and General Release with Mr. Podboy." 
This section provides an overview of our executive compensation philosophy, the overall objectives of our executive compensation program and each compensation component that we provided in 2018. Each of the key elements of our executive compensation program is discussed in more detail below. The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our NEOs should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to provide a total compensation package intended to align executive compensation with the Company's performance and with stockholder interests, and to attract, motivate and retain talented and experienced executive officers through competitive compensation arrangements. 
At our annual meeting of stockholders on May 9, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Meeting"), we provided our stockholders with an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs (the "say-on-pay proposal"). At the 2018 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs, with over 70% of the votes cast in favor of the say-on-pay proposal. Our board and our compensation committee believe this affirms the stockholders' support of our approach to executive compensation, and did not make any significant changes to our approach in 2018. Our board and our compensation committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs. In addition, when determining how often to hold future say-on-pay proposal votes to approve the compensation of our NEOs, our board and our compensation committee took into account the preference for a triennial vote expressed by our stockholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting, with over 71% of the votes cast in favor. Accordingly, our board and our compensation committee determined that we will hold a say-on-pay proposal vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs every three years. We presently expect that our next say-on-pay advisory vote will be conducted at our 2021 Annual Meeting. We are not conducting a say-on-pay advisory vote at our 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Executive Summary 
Summary of 2018 Financial and Operational Results 
We continue to execute on our strategy to enhance our multi-tenant retail platform. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed approximately $799.8 million in real estate transactions, which included   approximately $91.0 million of IAGM Retail Fund I, LLC ("IAGM") joint-venture owned property dispositions. IAGM is an unconsolidated retail joint venture partnership between the Company as 55% owner and PGGM Private Real Estate Fund ("PGGM"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acquired Retail Properties in Core Markets. For InvenTrust, the right properties mean open-air grocery anchored and certain necessity-based power centers, and the right markets mean those with above average growth in population, employment and wages. InvenTrust's targeted core markets include  those with above average population, employment and wage growth. In 2018, we acquired three retail properties, including one retail property classified as a consolidated variable interest entity ("VIE"), and two retail parcels adjacent to  two existing retail properties for an aggregate acquisition price of approximately $222.6 million. In addition, we increased average base rent per square foot for wholly-owned and consolidated retail properties 8.8% and for wholly-owned,  consolidated and IAGM owned properties 8.4% from the prior year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Opportunistically dispose of retail properties with maximized values and retail properties not located in our  core markets. We continue to opportunistically dispose of properties in low-growth markets or where we believe the properties' values have been maximized. Additionally, these types of dispositions  will allow the Company to re-deploy resources into properties in our core markets. In 2018, we disposed of 16 retail properties, including the surrender of two properties to their respective lenders in  satisfaction of non-recourse debt, and completed a partial condemnation at one retail property for an aggregate gross disposition price of approximately $466.2 million. In addition, in 2018 we disposed of  two IAGM retail properties for a gross disposition price of approximately $91.0 million.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintain low leverage and a flexible capital structure. We continually evaluate the economic and credit  environment and its impact on our business. We believe we are appropriately positioned to have significant liquidity to continue executing on our strategy. We expect to have the ability to repay, refinance or extend any of our debt, and we believe  we have adequate sources of funds to meet short-term cash needs related to these refinancings or extensions. In 2018, an aggregate of approximately $231.9 million of cash was used to pay-off debt, debt  prepayment penalties, principal payments of mortgage debt, and payment of loan fees and other deposits. In addition, as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, in  2018 we entered into an amended and restated unsecured term loan credit agreement which provides for $400.0 million in unsecured term loans and a second amended and restated unsecured revolving credit agreement which provides for a  $350.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2018, we had $352.0 million outstanding on the unsecured term loans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pursue re-development opportunities at our current retail  properties. We have a coordinated program to increase rental income by maximizing existing re-development opportunities and identifying locations in our current multi-tenant retail platform where we can  develop pad sites. In addition, we are working with our tenants to expand rentable square footage at select retail properties where demand warrants. Certain redevelopment opportunities may include a mixed-use  component.

In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018, we achieved net income of $83.8 million and funds from operations ("FFO") (a non-generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") ("non-GAAP") financial measure) of $134.7 million. Our FFO, which is based on the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") definition, is net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable real property, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we hold an interest. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our calculation of FFO Applicable to Common Shares as management considers FFO a widely accepted and appropriate non-GAAP measure of performance for REITs. For more information regarding FFO and a reconciliation of FFO to net income, please see "Part II. Item 6. Selected Financial Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  On March 2, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution paid in April 2018, from $0.0695 per share to $0.0716 per share, on an annualized basis. The adjustment to the distribution rate equates to a 2018 calendar year total distribution of $0.0711 per share (an annual rate of $0.0695 per share paid in January 2018, an annual rate of $0.0716 per share paid in each of April, July and October 2018). On November 7, 2018, our Board approved an increase to our annual distribution rate effective for the quarterly distribution payable in April 2019, from $0.0716 per share to $0.0737, on an annualized basis. 
Compensation Elements 
Our executive compensation program for 2018 consisted of the following elements: base salary, annual cash bonus, equity-based long-term incentive awards, retirement benefits and health/welfare benefits. Each of these elements taken separately, as well as each of these elements taken as a whole, was necessary to support our overall compensation objectives. The following table sets forth the key elements of our NEOs compensation for 2018, along with the primary objective associated with each element of compensation. 
The compensation committee believes that executive compensation should reflect the value created for our stockholders, while supporting our operational goals and long-term business plans and strategies. In addition, the compensation committee believes that such compensation should assist us in attracting and retaining key executives critical to our long-term success. 
Good Governance and Best Practices 
With respect to our executive compensation program, we are committed to staying apprised of current issues, emerging trends, and best practices. To this end, when considering executive officer compensation packages for 2018, our compensation committee worked with our independent compensation consultant, FPL Associates ("FPL"), to conduct a comprehensive market analysis of our executive compensation program and pay, and to generally align target direct compensation for our NEOs conservatively relative to the median of the applicable peer group. 
Our executive compensation programs and practices for 2018 included the following features, which we believe are mindful of the concerns of our stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our NEOs were eligible to earn annual bonuses based upon achievement of specific annual financial, operational  and individual objectives that were designed to challenge the NEOs to strong performance.  
[END TABLE]

Pay for Performance 
Our 2018 compensation program for our NEOs was designed to align key financial and operational achievements with the annual cash bonuses to such NEOs. Annual cash bonuses were focused primarily on financial performance for 2018, as well as individual performance. Under our annual bonus programs for 2018, our NEOs were eligible to earn cash bonuses based on each of their individual performances in support of our financial, operational, and cultural goals for 2018, as well as our achievement in 2018 of performance goals relating to adjusted funds from operations ("Adjusted FFO") and/or modified retail net operating income ("Modified NOI") (each a non-GAAP financial measure). For more information regarding FFO and Modified NOI, why management believes they are useful for investors and a reconciliation of FFO and Modified NOI to net income, please see "Item 6. Selected Financial Data" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Our compensation committee believes these annual targeted operational and financial goals align with our strategy to attain long-term financial stability that will support sustained cash flows beneficial to our stockholders. Performance of each NEO was not evaluated solely upon satisfaction of pre-determined performance goals, but was also evaluated subjectively by the compensation committee. Depending on actual results, each such NEO (other than Mr. Jaworski) was eligible to earn a maximum of 150% of his or her target bonus amount if the maximum performance targets were achieved or exceeded. In determining each executive's actual cash bonus under the bonus program, each executive's target bonus percentage was weighted between each applicable performance metric based on the officer's core responsibilities within the Company. Our compensation committee did not establish a maximum bonus amount with respect to Modified NOI goal. 
Stockholder Interest Alignment 
Equity awards granted in 2018 to our NEOs included grants of restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards, which vest over time based on the executive's continued employment, and which entitle each executive to receive shares of our common stock upon vesting of the RSU award. Our annual bonus program, combined with grants of equity-based awards, creates a balanced focus on the achievement of short-term and long-term financial and operational goals. Our compensation committee believes that this "at risk" compensation in the form of annual bonuses and long-term equity-based incentives plays a significant role in aligning management's interests with those of our stockholders. 
Determination of Compensation 
Roles of Our Compensation Committee and Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions 
Our board and our compensation committee are (or were, as applicable) responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, as well as determining and approving the ongoing compensation arrangements for our NEOs. Our compensation committee evaluates the individual performance and contributions of our Chief Executive Officer. Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the individual performance and contributions of each other NEO, and reports to our compensation committee his recommendations regarding the other NEOs' compensation.  Engagement of Compensation Consultant 
For 2018, our compensation committee retained the services of FPL to serve as the compensation committee's independent compensation consultant. FPL was engaged to assist the compensation committee with a variety of tasks, which included among other things, analyzing executive and board compensation relative to peer companies. FPL did not provide any other services to the Company in 2018. Our compensation committee has determined that FPL is independent and does not have any conflicts of interest with the Company. 
Peer Group Review 
With respect to the compensation packages offered to our NEOs, the compensation committee reviewed total cash and long- term compensation levels for executive officers of the Company against those of our peer group companies in an effort to set executive compensation at levels that will attract and motivate qualified executives while rewarding performance based on corporate objectives. The compensation committee set compensation levels for each executive officer on the basis of several factors, including the executive officer's level of experience, competitive market data applicable to the executive officer's positions and functional responsibilities, promoting recruitment and retention, the performance of the executive officer and the Company's annual and long-term performance, as applicable. 
The peer group used to set 2018 base salaries, bonus targets and long-term equity awards for our NEOs consisted of the following 17 similarly sized retail real estate investment trusts ("REITs"): 
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
The market for experienced management is highly competitive in our industry. One of our principal goals and keys to our success is to attract and retain the most highly qualified executives to manage each of our business functions. Our compensation committee works with FPL to understand competitive pay practices within the REIT industry and to design executive compensation programs that fit our business strategy and align the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders. We seek to provide total compensation to our NEOs that is competitive with the total compensation paid by comparable REITs and other real estate companies in our peer group. 
Elements of Executive Compensation Program 
The following describes the primary components of our executive compensation program for each of our NEOs for 2018, the rationale for each component and how compensation amounts were determined. 
Base Salary 
In 2018, we provided our NEOs with a base salary to compensate them for services rendered to us during the year. The base salary payable to each NEO is intended to provide a fixed component of compensation reflecting the executive's skill set, experience, role and responsibilities. The base salaries for each of the NEOs for 2018   were determined based in part on the analysis by FPL of the compensation practices of companies in the Company's peer group. The following table sets forth the annual base salary rates for each of our NEOs for 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Thomas P. McGuinness    $ 772,500   
  Michael E. Podboy      515,000   
  Ivy Z. Greaner      475,000   
  Christy L. David      359,000   
  Adam M. Jaworski      301,790   
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Bonuses 
In 2018, our NEOs participated in an annual bonus program for employees of the Company under which each of the NEOs was eligible to receive an annual cash bonus based upon the achievement of certain performance criteria. Target annual cash bonus awards for Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy were specified in each of their respective employment agreements, and for Ms. Greaner and Mr. Jaworski were specified in their offer letters, with threshold and maximum bonus levels determined on an annual basis. With respect to Ms. David, who was appointed as an executive officer of the Company during 2018, a portion of her 2018 annual bonus opportunity (with respect to the period prior to her appointment) was subject to satisfaction of the Modified NOI performance goal and a portion of her annual bonus opportunity (with respect to the period following to her appointment) was subject to satisfaction of the Adjusted FFO performance goal. The target bonus levels for our NEOs for 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name     Target Annual Bonus         (% of annual base salary)           
Name     Target Annual Bonus         (% of annual base salary)           
  Thomas P. McGuinness    125% 
  Michael E. Podboy    90% 
  Ivy Z. Greaner    90% 
  Christy L. David    51% 
  Adam M. Jaworski    40% 
[END TABLE]
Under the annual bonus program for Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy, Ms. Greaner and Ms. David (with respect to the portion of the year following her appointment as an executive officer), the 2018 performance goals were: (1) Adjusted FFO, weighted at 75% of each NEO's target annual bonus opportunity, and (2) individual performance, weighted at 25% of each NEO's target annual bonus opportunity. 
Under the annual bonus program for Mr. Jaworski and Ms. David (with respect to the portion of the year prior to her appointment as an executive officer), the 2018 performance goals were: (1) Modified NOI, and (2) individuals performance. 
Adjusted FFO, as we define it, is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects components of financial performance related to our multi-tenant retail business for which our NEOs have influence and responsibility. Adjusted FFO is generally calculated as FFO (as defined above), but (i) including net operating income at our proportionate share and fee income earned on our unconsolidated retail joint venture; (ii) excluding the effects of non-retail joint ventures, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and sales of marketable securities, and general and administrative expenses related to discontinued operations; and (iii) excluding adjustments in accordance with GAAP related to amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs and the effect of straight-line rental revenue. Adjusted FFO should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of liquidity. Our method of calculating Adjusted FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs. Accordingly, our Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements reported by such other REITs. 
Modified NOI, as we define it, reflects the income from operations excluding lease termination income and GAAP rent adjustments (such as straight line rent and above/below market lease amortization). Modified NOI excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, and other investment income from corporate investments.  The table below reflects the Adjusted FFO and Modified NOI performance goals for 2018. The individual performance bonus component for each of our NEOs was based on a qualitative assessment of their individual performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted FFO    $83.38 million    $104.23 million    $125.07 million 
 Modified NOI    N/A    $151.93 million    N/A 
[END TABLE]
With respect to the Adjusted FFO goal, no bonus would be earned for performance below the threshold level, 50% of the executive's bonus target would be earned for performance at the threshold level, 100% of the executive's bonus target would be earned for performance at the target level and 150% of the executive's bonus target would be earned for performance at the maximum level. Performance between threshold and target and between target and maximum levels would be interpolated on a straight-line basis. 
For 2018, the Company achieved Adjusted FFO of $119.33 million, which was above the target goal of $104.23 million. Therefore, each of Mr. McGuinness and Mses. Greaner and David were entitled to 136.23% of their target bonus with respect to the Adjusted FFO performance metric. Further, the Company achieved a Modified NOI of $162.55 million, which was 106.99% above the target goal of $151.93 million. Therefore Mr. Jaworski and Ms. David were entitled to 106.99% of their respective target bonus with respect to the Modified NOI performance metric. 
Our compensation committee determined that the bonus amounts for individual performances were payable at 112% of target for Mr. McGuinness, 110% of target for Ms. Greaner and 110% of target for Ms. David. Mr. Jaworski's bonus amount will be paid at 44.95% of target, calculated at 106.99% of target and then multiplied by individual performance metric of 105%. 
Pursuant to his Severance Agreement with the Company, Mr. Podboy received an amount equal to a pro-rated portion of his 2018 target bonus and did not otherwise receive an annual bonus for 2018. 
Based on these results, bonuses were determined as follows for Messrs. McGuinness and Jaworski and Mses. Greaner and David: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Thomas P. McGuinness    $ 986,591        N/A      $ 313,828      $ 1,300,419   
  Ivy Z. Greaner    $ 209,416        N/A      $ 64,052      $ 273,468   
  Christy L. David    $ 74,605      $ 77,675      $ 22,818      $ 175,098   
  Adam M. Jaworski      N/A      $ 135,612        N/A      $ 135,612   
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive 
The goals of our long-term equity-based awards granted in 2018 were to promote and encourage efforts towards the execution of our long-term business plans and, thereby, to align the interest of our officers, including our NEOs, with those of our stockholders by directly linking the value of the RSUs granted to our NEOs with the value of the Company.  Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
In 2018, our compensation committee approved the following RSU awards (with dividend equivalents) to our NEOs (the "RSU Awards") under the InvenTrust Properties Corp. 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the "Incentive Award Plan") and pursuant to one or more restricted stock unit award agreements (the "RSU Award Agreement"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]

  Christy L. David    111,465* 
  Adam M. Jaworski    78,453** 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Ms. David was granted an annual RSU award on May 9, 2018 (65,685 RSUs) and an additional RSU award on  November 6, 2018 in connection with her promotion to Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary (45,780 RSUs).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
**  Mr. Jaworski was granted an annual RSU award on May 9, 2018 (72,084 RSUs) and an additional RSU award  on November 6, 2018 in connection with the additional services provided by him as Interim Principal Financial Officer (6,369 RSUs) which vested in full on December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Each of the RSU Awards (other than the RSU Award granted to Mr. Jaworski on November 6, 2018) vests in three equal annual installments on the last business day of each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to the executive's continued service. The RSU Award granted to Mr. Jaworski on November 6, 2018, vested in full on December 31, 2018. If an executive's service is terminated by us other than for "cause," or by the executive for "good reason," in either case, on the date of, or during the twenty-four month period following, a change in control of the Company, or due to the executive's death or "disability" (as defined in the RSU Award Agreement), any then-unvested RSUs will vest in full upon such termination. Upon an executive's termination of service for any other reason, any then-unvested RSUs will automatically be cancelled and forfeited by the executive. Any RSUs that become vested will be paid to the executive in whole shares of our common stock within 60 days after the applicable vesting date. 
Each RSU was granted in tandem with a corresponding dividend equivalent. Each dividend equivalent entitles the executive to receive payments equal to the amount of the dividends paid on the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs (whether vested or unvested) to which the dividend equivalent relates. 
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Podboy's Severance Agreement with the Company, Mr. Podboy forfeited all unvested RSU awards which he then held. 
Additional information regarding the vesting terms and conditions applicable to all outstanding RSU awards held by our NEOs is set forth under the heading "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Share Unit Awards 
Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy were previously granted awards under the Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. 2014 Share Unit Plan (the "Retail Plan") in the form of "annual share unit" awards and "contingency share unit" awards. 
Effective as of June 19, 2015, in connection with the adoption of the Incentive Award Plan, we terminated the Retail Plan. Awards outstanding as of the termination of the plan remained outstanding and subject to the terms of the plan and the applicable award agreement. Mr. Podboy's share unit awards terminated as of August 27, 2018 in connection with his resignation and termination of employment. In addition, if a payment event does not occur for purposes of the awards on or prior to March 12, 2019 (i.e., the fifth anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date), all share unit awards held by Mr. McGuinness will be forfeited and terminated as of such date. No additional awards will be granted under the Retail Plan.  The Retail Plan provided for the grant of "share unit" awards to eligible participants. The value of a "share unit" was determined based on a phantom capitalization of our retail/non-core business, and does not necessarily correspond to the value of a share of common stock of the Company. 
Similarly, vesting of the share units is conditioned upon the occurrence of a triggering event, such as a Listing Event (such as an initial public offering or other listing of shares on a national securities exchange) or a change in control of the retail/non-core business, and if no triggering event occurs within five years following the applicable vesting commencement date, then the share units are forfeited. 
Subject to applicable vesting conditions, each share unit represents the right to receive a cash payment or shares of common stock of the Company or an acquiror thereof, as applicable, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the share unit on the date of the triggering event. The "fair market value" of a share unit will be determined by the board of directors in good faith, and prior to a Listing Event of the applicable entity, will be determined by reference to the third party valuation performed to estimate the value of a share unit on a fully diluted basis, using methodologies and assumptions substantially similar to those used in prior valuations. 
Each "annual share unit" award (an "Annual Share Unit Award") will vest and be settled on the later to occur of (i) the date of a change in control or Listing Event with respect to our retail/non-core business, as applicable, and (ii) the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award, subject to the executive's continued employment through the applicable settlement date, provided that in no event will the Annual Share Unit Awards vest or be settled unless such a change in control or Listing Event occurs on or before the fifth anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award. In the case of a Listing Event, the Annual Share Unit Award will be settled in shares of common stock of our retail/non-core business, and in the event of a change in control, the Annual Share Unit Award will be settled in cash (or, if the acquiring entity is a publicly traded company and the Annual Share Unit Award is converted into another form of equity award of the acquiring entity at the time of the change in control, then the Annual Share Unit Award will be settled in shares of the acquiring entity). 
The vesting and settlement of each "contingency share unit" award (a "Contingency Share Unit Award") is contingent upon the occurrence of a change in control or Listing Event with respect to our retail/non-core business, as applicable, that occurs no later than the fifth anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date. If a Listing Event occurs, the Contingency Share Unit Award will vest and settle in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Listing Event, subject to the executive's continued employment through each vesting date. If a qualifying change in control occurs, 100% of the Contingency Share Unit Award will vest and settle on the one-year anniversary of the change in control event, subject to the executive's continued employment through the vesting date. The awards will be settled in shares or cash in the same manner described above with respect to the Annual Share Unit Awards. 
Each of the share unit awards granted to the NEOs has a vesting commencement date of March 12, 2014. The value of each share unit was equal to $10.00 at the time of grant and was determined by reference to the third-party valuation performed for us as of December 31, 2013. On November 9, 2018, our compensation committee recommended and our Board approved an adjustment to the value of the share unit awards to $7.98 per share unit as result of intercompany activity from January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2018 which included intercompany transfers of assets and debt between the retail business and the hotel and student housing businesses, the spin-off of non-core assets into Highland REIT and company repurchase of shares through dutch tenders. The adjustment to the value also resulted in an adjustment to the number of share units previously awarded to individuals. 
Additional information regarding the vesting terms and conditions applicable to all outstanding share unit awards held by our NEOs is set forth under the heading "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Other Elements of Compensation 
In 2018, we provided customary employee benefits to our full- and part-time employees, including our NEOs, including medical and dental benefits, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and group life insurance.  We have established a 401(k) retirement savings plan for our employees, including our NEOs, who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. In 2018, our NEOs were eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan on the same terms as other full-time employees. The Code allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation, within prescribed limits, on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the 401(k) plan. For 2018, we matched dollar for dollar the contributions made by participants in the 401(k) plan for the first $6,000 of the employee's contributions. These matching contributions are subject to vesting based on the participant's years of service. We believe that providing a vehicle for tax-deferred retirement savings though our 401(k) plan, and making matching contributions, adds to the overall desirability of our compensation packages and further incentivizes our employees in accordance with our compensation policies. 
Severance and Change in Control-Based Compensation 
As more fully described below under the caption "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," the employment agreements with Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy provided for certain payments and/or benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment. On July 9, 2018, our compensation committee adopted the Company's Executive Severance and Change of Control Plan (the "Severance Plan") and designated each of Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy and Ms. Greaner as participants in the Severance Plan. On August 9, 2018, the compensation committee designated Ms. David as a participant in the Severance Plan. In connection with their participation in the Severance Plan, the employment agreements previously in effect with Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy were terminated. In addition, Mr. Jaworski and, prior to her designation as a participant in the Severance Plan, Ms. David, were eligible to participate in the InvenTrust Properties Corp. Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Severance Plan"). 
The terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the CIC Severance Plan and the payments and benefits to which the NEOs may become entitled under such plans in the event of a qualifying termination of employment are more fully described below under "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," 
We believe that job security and terminations of employment, both within and outside of the change in control context, are causes of significant concern and uncertainty for senior executives and that providing protections to our NEOs in these contexts is therefore appropriate in order to alleviate these concerns and allow the executives to remain focused on their duties and responsibilities to the Company in all situations. 
Furthermore, the award agreements covering the share unit awards granted to Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy and the RSU Award Agreements provide for accelerated vesting of the awards upon certain terminations of employment. A detailed description of the acceleration provisions applicable to the share unit awards and the RSU Awards is set forth under the heading "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Severance Agreement and General Release with Mr. Podboy 
Effective as of August 27, 2018, Mr. Podboy resigned as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer and as an employee of the Company, and from all other officer, director or other positions he held with any subsidiary, division or affiliate of the Company. 
In connection with Mr. Podboy's resignation, the Company and Mr. Podboy entered into the Severance Agreement. Subject to Mr. Podboy's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the Severance Agreement and the general release of claims set forth therein, Mr. Podboy received the following compensation and benefits: (i) $85,833.32 paid on the second regularly scheduled payroll date following the effective date of Mr. Podboy's resignation (the "Separation Date"); and (ii) payment by the Company of continued health and other insurance coverage for a period of 60 days following the Separation Date. 
Additionally, subject to Mr. Podboy's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the Severance Agreement and Mr. Podboy's execution of a second general release of claims in favor of the Company, which became effective within 30 days following the Separation Date, Mr. Podboy will be entitled to the following compensation and benefits: (iii) $1,467,750 payable over a period of 12 months commencing with the Company's regular payroll date that coincides with or next follows the 60th day following the Separation Date   (the "Cash Severance"); (iv) $378,216 (in respect of a pro-rated 2018 bonus) payable in a lump-sum on the Company's regular payroll date that coincides with or next follows the 60th day following the Separation Date; (v) continued health insurance coverage at the Company's expense for the period beginning on the 60th day following the Separation Date and ending up to 18 months following the Separation Date; and (vi) 12 months of outplacement assistance at the Company's expense. 
Effective as of the Separation Date, all unvested share unit awards and unvested restricted stock unit awards held by Mr. Podboy were forfeited. 
The Severance Agreement further provides that Mr. Podboy will continue to be bound by the confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and other restrictive covenants contained in Mr. Podboy's participation agreement under the Severance Plan, provided that Mr. Podboy's non-competition covenant has been amended such that (i) it will apply for a period of six months following the Separation Date, and (ii) the competing businesses covered by the covenant will include certain companies enumerated in the Severance Agreement. Additionally, in the event that Mr. Podboy becomes employed or engaged by any person or entity that, during the two-year period following the Separation Date, makes an offer to acquire all or substantially all of the equity interests, business or assets of the Company, Mr. Podboy will promptly repay to the Company the Cash Severance, and the Company will have no further obligation to pay any additional Cash Severance to Mr. Podboy. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Code Section 162(m) 
Generally, Section 162(m) of the Code disallows a tax deduction for any publicly-held corporation for individual compensation exceeding $1.0 million in any taxable year to certain of its executive officers. We believe that we qualify as a REIT under the Code and generally are not subject to federal income taxes, provided that we distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year. As a result of the Company's tax status as a REIT, the loss of a deduction under Section 162(m) may not affect the amount of federal income tax payable by the Company. Therefore, our board and our compensation committee generally have not taken the deductibility limit imposed by Section 162(m) into consideration in setting compensation. 
Code Section 409A 
Section 409A of the Code, or Section 409A, requires that "nonqualified deferred compensation" be deferred and paid under plans or arrangements that satisfy the requirements of the statute with respect to the timing of deferral elections, timing of payments and certain other matters. Failure to satisfy these requirements can expose employees and other service providers to accelerated income tax liabilities, penalty taxes and interest on their vested compensation under such plans. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is our intention to design and administer our compensation and benefits plans and arrangements for all of our employees and other service providers, including our NEOs, so that they are either exempt from, or satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A. 
Code Section 280G 
Section 280G of the Code disallows a tax deduction with respect to excess parachute payments to certain executives of companies which undergo a change in control. In addition, Section 4999 of the Code imposes a 20% excise tax on the individual with respect to the excess parachute payment. Parachute payments are compensation linked to or triggered by a change in control and may include, but are not limited to, bonus payments, severance payments, certain fringe benefits, and payments and acceleration of vesting from long-term incentive plans including share units and other equity-based compensation. Excess parachute payments are parachute payments that exceed a threshold determined under Section 280G based on the executive's prior compensation. In approving the compensation arrangements for our NEOs, our board and our compensation committee consider all elements of the cost to our company of providing such compensation, including the potential impact of Section 280G. However, our board or our compensation committee may, in their judgment, authorize compensation arrangements that could give rise to loss of deductibility under Section 280G and the imposition of excise taxes under Section 4999 when they believe that such arrangements are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent.  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or ASC Topic 718, for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to calculate the grant date "fair value" of their stock-based awards using a variety of assumptions. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based awards in their income statements over the period that an employee is required to render service in exchange for the award. Grants of Annual Share Unit Awards and Contingency Share Unit Awards under the Retail Plan and RSU Awards under the Incentive Award Plan are accounted for as equity awards under ASC Topic 718. Our compensation committee regularly considers the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions. As accounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.

Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
The following provides a description of the material terms of the employment agreements and offer letters, as applicable, for our named executive officers. 
Employment Agreements – Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy 
On June 19, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement with Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy and on November 9, 2017, we amended Mr. Podboy's Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (each, an "Amended Employment Agreement"). In connection with the Company's adoption of the Severance Plan, each of the Amended Employment Agreements was terminated. 
The Amended Employment Agreements provided for the following annual base salaries: Mr. McGuinness – $700,000; Mr. Podboy – $395,000. Our compensation committee approved increases to these base salaries as follows for 2018: Mr. McGuinness – $772,500; Mr. Podboy – $515,000. In addition, pursuant to their Amended Employment Agreements, Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy were eligible to receive an annual cash performance bonus based upon the achievement of performance criteria established and approved by our compensation committee. The target awards for Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy under the Amended Employment Agreements were no less than 125% and 90% of such executive's annual base salary, respectively. In the event of a change in control or Listing Event of the Company, the NEO was eligible to receive a pro-rated portion of the executive's target annual bonus for the year in which such event occurs. 
The Amended Employment Agreements also contained a confidentiality covenant by the executive that extended indefinitely, a non-competition covenant that extended during the executive's employment and for a period of one year following a termination of the executive's employment and an employee and independent contractor non-solicitation covenant that extended during the executive's employment and for a period of three years following a termination of the executive's employment. The non-competition covenant contained in the Amended Employment Agreements generally prohibited the executive from engaging or associating with any person or entity that owns properties having an aggregate appraised value of at least $500 million and is actively engaged in the acquisition, ownership, development, improvement, operation, management, leasing or sale of community centers, grocery-anchored centers, strip centers and/or power centers. Each Amended Employment Agreement also included a mutual non-disparagement covenant by the executive and the Company. 
In addition to the terms described above, each of the Amended Employment Agreements also provided for certain payments and benefits upon a termination without "cause" or for "good reason" (each, as defined in the applicable employment agreement), which are described under the caption "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
As discussed above, in connection with Mr. Podboy' departure, the Company and Mr. Podboy entered into the Severance Agreement. Pursuant to the Severance Agreement, Mr. Podboy is entitled to certain severance payments and benefits, as more fully described below under the caption "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Offer Letter – Greaner 
In connection with Ms. Greaner's appointment as Chief Operating Officer, effective as of July 9, 2018, the Company entered into an employment offer letter with Ms. Greaner pursuant to which she is entitled to an annual base salary of $475,000 and will be eligible to participate in the Company's annual cash bonus program with a target annual bonus equal to 90% of her annual base salary. Ms. Greaner also received a one-time signing bonus of $100,000, $50,000 of which was payable on the first regular payroll date following Ms. Greaner's start date, with the remaining $50,000 paid two pay periods later. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, Ms. Greaner received an RSU Award valued at $500,000 under the Incentive Award Plan. The RSU Award will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2018, subject to Ms. Greaner's continued employment on each of the vesting dates. The Company also reimbursed Ms. Greaner for certain costs in connection with her relocation to the Chicago area.  Offer Letter – Jaworski 
On November 8, 2016, the Company entered into an employment offer letter with Mr. Jaworski pursuant to which he is entitled to an annual base salary of $293,000, subject to review for increase on an annual basis, and is eligible to participate in the Company's annual cash bonus program with a target annual bonus equal to 40% of his annual base salary. Mr. Jaworski's annual base salary has since been increased to $301,790. In addition during his service as the Company's Interim Principal Financial Officer, the Company has paid Mr. Jaworski additional bonus compensation in the amount of $5,000 per month. Mr. Jaworski also received a one-time signing bonus of $155,000, $55,000 of which was payable on the first regular payroll date following Mr. Jaworski's start date, with the remaining $100,000 paid at the same time as 2016 cash bonuses were paid to other Company employees. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the offer letter, Mr. Jaworski received an RSU Award valued at $184,000 under the Incentive Award Plan. The RSU Award vested in three equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2016, subject to Mr. Jaworski's continued employment on each of the vesting dates. 
Severance and Change In Control Plans 
On July 9, 2018, our compensation committee adopted the Severance Plan and has designated each of Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy and Mses. Greaner and David as participants in the Severance Plan. In addition, Mr. Jaworski and, prior to her designation as a participant in the Severance Plan, Ms. David, were eligible to participate in the CIC Severance Plan. 
The terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and the CIC Severance Plan and the payments and benefits to which the NEOs may become entitled under such plans in the event of a qualifying termination of employment are more fully described below under "- Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."

[END TABLE]
(1) Amounts represent the number of outstanding RSUs multiplied by $3.14, which is equal to the most recent estimated value per share of our common stock, which was as of May 1, 2018. 
(2) Represents outstanding RSUs, which vest, subject to the executive's continued service on the vesting date, at 100% on the last business day of 2019. If the executive's service is terminated by us other than for "cause" or by the executive for "good reason," in either case, on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control of the Company, or due to the executive's death or "disability" (as defined in the RSU Award Agreement), the RSU Award will vest in full upon such termination.  (3) Represents outstanding RSUs, which vest, subject to the executive's continued service on each applicable vesting date, as follows: 49% on the last business day of 2019 and 51% on the last business day of 2020. If the executive's service is terminated by us other than for "cause" or by the executive for "good reason," in either case, on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control of the Company, or due to the executive's death or "disability" (as defined in the RSU Award Agreement), the RSU Award will vest in full upon such termination. 
Outstanding Share Unit Awards at 2018 Year End 
The following table represents the Share Unit Awards outstanding as of December 31, 2018, granted under the Retail Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Thomas P. McGuinness   October 9, 2014 October 9, 2014   187,970(2) 187,970(3)   $1,500,000    1,500,000 
[END TABLE]
(1) Amounts represent the number of share units that were granted on the grant date multiplied by the estimated value of each share unit on the grant date as determined by our compensation committee by reference to the third-party valuation performed for the Company that was the most recent third-party evaluation available at the time of the grant. The estimated value of a share unit was determined based on a phantom capitalization of our retail/non-core business. Vesting of the share units is conditioned upon the occurrence of a triggering event, such as a Listing Event or a change in control of the retail/non-core business and, therefore, the market value of the share units cannot be definitively determined until the occurrence of such an event. 
(2) Represents an Annual Share Unit Award granted under the Retail Plan, which will vest and be settled on the later to occur of (i) the date of a change in control of the Company, or a Listing Event with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company, and (ii) the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award, subject to the executive's continued employment through the applicable settlement date, provided that in no event will the Annual Share Unit Award vest or be settled unless such a change in control or Listing Event occurs on or before the fifth anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award. The vesting commencement date for each Annual Share Unit Award is March 12, 2014. If a payment event does not occur for purposes of the awards on or prior to March 12, 2019 (i.e., the fifth anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date), all Annual Share Unit Awards held by Mr. McGuinness will be forfeited and terminated as of such date. 
(3) Represents a Contingency Share Unit Award granted under the Retail Plan, the vesting and settlement of which is contingent upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company, or a Listing Event with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company, in each case that occurs no later than the fifth anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date. If a Listing Event occurs, the Contingency Share Unit Award will vest and settle in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Listing Event, subject to the executive's continued employment through each vesting date. If a qualifying change in control occurs, 100% of the Contingency Share Unit Award will vest and settle on the one-year anniversary of the change in control event, subject to the executive's continued employment through the vesting date. The vesting commencement date for each Contingency Share Unit Award is March 12, 2014. If a payment event does not occur for purposes of the awards on or prior to March 12, 2019 (i.e., the fifth anniversary of the applicable vesting commencement date), all Annual Share Unit Awards held by Mr. McGuinness will be forfeited and terminated as of such date.

(1) Amounts represent the number of shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the vesting of RSUs multiplied by $3.14, which is equal to the estimated value per share of our common stock as of May 1, 2018 and was the latest valuation available on December 31, 2018, the vesting date.  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Our NEOs are entitled to certain payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment (whether or not such termination is in connection with a change in control) or upon a change in control or Listing Event. The following discussion describes the payments and benefits to which our NEOs, other than Mr. Podboy, would have become entitled upon a qualifying termination or change in control, as applicable, occurring on December 31, 2018. With respect to Mr. Podboy, the discussion describes the payments and benefits payable under the Severance Agreement in connection with his resignation of employment effective as of August 27, 2018. 
McGuinness Employment Agreement 
The following provides a description of the material terms of Mr. McGuinness' Amended Employment Agreement, as in effect prior to the termination of such agreement in July 2018. In connection with the Company's adoption of the Severance Plan, Mr. McGuinness' Amended Employment Agreement was terminated. 
Under Mr. McGuinness' Amended Employment Agreements, if his employment was terminated by the Company, without "cause" or by Mr. McGuinness for "good reason" (each, as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement), Mr. McGuinness would be entitled to the following severance payments and benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment in an amount equal to a multiple of the sum of Mr. McGuinness' annual base salary and target  bonus for the year in which the termination occurred, payable in equal installments over a period of 12 months commencing within 60 days following the termination date (except as described below); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment or reimbursement by us, of premiums for healthcare continuation coverage under COBRA for  Mr. McGuinness and his dependents for up to 18 months after the termination date.  
[END TABLE]
The cash severance multiple for Mr. McGuinness under his Amended Employment Agreement for both non-change in control and change in control termination scenarios was 2x (non-change in control) and 3x (change in control). Under Mr. McGuinness' Amended Employment Agreement, the change in control severance multiple would apply in the event of a termination by us without "cause" that occurs on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control transaction or a sale of our retail business, or in the event of a termination by Mr. McGuinness for "good reason" that occurs on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control transaction (each, as defined in the Amended Employment Agreement). Cash severance payable in the event of a qualifying change in control termination would be made in a single lump sum within 60 days following the termination date (rather than installments over 12 months). Mr. McGuinness' right to receive the severance or other benefits described above would be subject to him signing, delivering and not revoking a general release agreement in a form generally used by us. 
Mr. McGuinness' Amended Employment Agreement further provided that, to the extent that any payment or benefit received by him in connection with a change in control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such payments and/or benefits would be subject to a "best pay cap" reduction if such reduction would result in a greater net after-tax benefit to Mr. McGuinness than receiving the full amount of such payments. 
Executive Severance and Change In Control Plan 
On July 9, 2018, our compensation committee adopted the Severance Plan and designated each of Messrs. McGuinness and Podboy and Ms. Greaner as participants in the Severance Plan. On August 9, 2018, the compensation committee designated Ms. David as a participant in the Severance Plan. 
Under the Severance Plan, in the event a participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without "cause" (other than by reason of death or disability) or by the participant for "good reason" (each, as defined in the Severance Plan), the participant will be entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A severance payment in an amount equal to a multiple of the participant's annual base salary and target cash  bonus, payable in equal installments over a period of 12 months commencing within 60 days following the participant's termination date (except as described below); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment or reimbursement by the Company of premiums for healthcare continuation coverage under COBRA for the  participant and his or her dependents for up to 18 months after the termination date.  
[END TABLE]
The cash severance multiple for each executive for both non-change of control and change of control termination scenarios is as follows: Mr. McGuinness – 2x (non-change of control) and 3x (change of control); Ms. David and Ms. Greaner – 1.5x (non-change of control) and 2.5x (change of control). The change of control severance multiple will apply in the event of a qualifying termination of employment that occurs on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a "change of control" (as defined in the Severance Plan). Cash severance payable in the event of a qualifying change of control termination will be made in a single lump sum payment within 60 days following the participant's termination date (rather than installments over 12 months). A participant's right to receive the severance or other benefits described above will be subject to the participant signing, delivering and not revoking a general release agreement in a form generally used by the Company. 
The Severance Plan also provides that in the event of a change of control or certain specified events resulting in a listing of the Company's shares on a national securities exchange (including an initial public offering), a participant will be eligible to receive a pro-rated portion of the participant's target annual bonus for the year in which such event occurs. 
The Severance Plan further provides that, to the extent that any payment or benefit received by a participant in connection with a change of control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, such payments and/or benefits will be subject to a "best pay cap" reduction if such reduction would result in a greater net after-tax benefit to the participant than receiving the full amount of such payments. 
Each letter agreement entered into with the executives contains a confidentiality covenant by the executive that extends indefinitely, a noncompetition covenant that extends during the executive's employment and for a period of one year following a termination of the executive's employment, and an employee and independent contractor nonsolicitation covenant that extends during the executive's employment and for a period of three years following a termination of the executive's employment. Each letter agreement also includes a mutual non-disparagement covenant by the executive and the Company. 
The Company may amend or terminate the Severance Plan at any time and for any reason, provided that a participant's right to receive payments and benefits under the Plan may not, without the participant's written consent, be adversely affected by an amendment or termination of the Severance Plan made within 12 months prior to the participant's termination of employment or within 12 months before and after a change of control. The Company is required to provide notice to participants within 15 days of any amendment or termination of the Severance Plan. 
CIC Severance Plan 
Mr. Jaworski and, prior to her designation as a participant in the Severance Plan, Ms. David, were eligible to participate in the CIC Severance Plan. The CIC Severance Plan provides severance benefits to eligible participants in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company or a sale of its retail business. 
Under the CIC Severance Plan, in the event of a "qualifying termination" of employment, Mr. Jaworski is, and Ms. David would have been, entitled to receive the following payments and benefits, subject to his or her execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims against the Company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 150% of the  executive's annual base salary, plus (ii) the executive's target annual performance bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, plus (iii) a pro-rated portion of the  executive's target annual performance bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, payable no later than 60 days following the executive's termination date (or, if earlier, three days following the date on which the general release  of claims executed by the executive becomes effective); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment or reimbursement by the Company for the COBRA premiums for the executive and the executive's covered  dependents for up to 12 months following the executive's termination date.  
[END TABLE]
 Under the CIC Severance Plan, a "qualifying termination" includes a termination of the participant's employment by the Company without "cause" or by the participant for "good reason," in any case, on or within 24 months after the first to occur of a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company's retail business (each as defined in the CIC Severance Plan). However, in no event will a participant be deemed to have experienced a qualifying termination as a result of the participant's death or disability, or if in connection with such change in control or sale of the retail business, the participant's employment with the Company was terminated and the participant was offered comparable employment or accepted comparable employment with the successor entity. 
A participant's right to receive and/or retain the severance benefits payable under the CIC Severance Plan is conditioned upon on the participant's continued compliance with any confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition and similar covenants with respect to which the participant is bound pursuant to any agreement with the Company. 
The CIC Severance Plan further provides that, to the extent that any payment or benefit received by a participant in connection with a change of control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, such payments and/or benefits will be subject to a "best pay cap" reduction if such reduction would result in a greater net after-tax benefit to the participant than receiving the full amount of such payments. 
The CIC Severance Plan provides that during the 24-month period following a change in control or sale of the retail business, neither the Company nor any successor entity may terminate the plan or any participation notice, nor may the Company or any successor entity amend the plan or any participation notice if any such amendment would have an adverse impact on the interests of any participant under the plan, in either case, without the express written consent of each affected participant. Additionally, following a participant's qualifying termination, no termination or amendment of the CIC Severance Plan or any participation notice may adversely affect the rights of such participant under the plan without such participant's written consent. 
RSU Awards 
The RSU Agreements provide for accelerated vesting of the awards in the event of certain terminations of service. If an NEO's service is terminated by us other than for "cause" or by the NEO for "good reason," in either case, on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control of the Company, or due to the NEO's death or "disability" (as defined in the RSU Award Agreement), the RSU Award will vest in full upon such termination. 
Share Unit Awards 
The award agreements covering the share unit awards made to Mr. McGuinness provide for accelerated vesting of the awards in the event of certain terminations of service. 
If Mr. McGuinness' employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by him for "good reason" (each, as defined in the applicable award agreement or Retail Plan), in either case, following the occurrence of a change in control or Listing Event, the unvested portion of the award will vest in full and be settled on the date of such termination or resignation. In addition, in the event that Mr. McGuinness' employment is terminated on account of his death or "disability" (as defined in the applicable award agreement) after the occurrence of a change in control or Listing Event, then with respect to all share units which are unvested as of that time, Mr. McGuinness will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the share units on the date of the termination. In the event that Mr. McGuinness' employment is terminated on account of his death or "disability," and a change in control or Listing Event had not yet occurred, then upon the occurrence of a change in control or Listing Event, Mr. McGuinness will be entitled to a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the share units on the date of the change in control or Listing Event, as applicable. 
Podboy Severance Agreement 
Under the Severance Agreement, subject to Mr. Podboy's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the Severance Agreement and the general release of claims set forth therein, Mr. Podboy received the following   compensation and benefits: (i) $85,833.32 paid on the second regularly scheduled payroll date following the Separation Date; and (ii) payment by the Company of continued health and other insurance coverage for a period of 60 days following the Separation Date. Additionally, subject to Mr. Podboy's continued compliance with the terms and conditions of the Severance Agreement and Mr. Podboy's execution of a second general release of claims in favor of the Company, which became effective within 30 days following the Separation Date, Mr. Podboy will be entitled to the following compensation and benefits: (iii) Cash Severance equal to $1,467,750 payable over a period of 12 months commencing with the Company's regular payroll date that coincides with or next follows the 60th day following the Separation Date; (iv) $378,216 (in respect of a pro-rated 2018 bonus) payable in a lump-sum on the Company's regular payroll date that coincides with or next follows the 60th day following the Separation Date; (v) continued health insurance coverage at the Company's expense for the period beginning on the 60th day following the Separation Date and ending up to 18 months following the Separation Date; and (vi) 12 months of outplacement assistance at the Company's expense. The following table summarizes the amount of compensation and benefits paid or payable to Mr. Podboy under the Severance Agreement.

Summary of Potential Payments 
The following table summarizes the payments that would be made to our NEOs, other than Mr. Podboy, upon the occurrence of certain qualifying terminations of employment or a change in control, Listing Event or a sale of our retail business (a "retail sale"), assuming such NEO's termination of employment with the Company occurred on December 31, 2018 and, where relevant, that a change in control or Listing Event of the Company or a retail sale occurred on December 31, 2018. Amounts shown in the table below do not include (1) accrued but unpaid salary or bonuses and (2) other benefits earned or accrued by the NEO during his employment that are available to all salaried employees, such as accrued vacation.  Mr. Podboy resigned from his position as an executive officer and all other positions that he held with the Company and its subsidiaries effective as of August 27, 2018. Payments made to Mr. Podboy under the Severance Agreement in connection with his resignation of employment are described above under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - Podboy Severance Agreement."

(1) Includes (i) with respect to the RSU Awards, amounts to which NEOs would be entitled to upon a termination of employment on account of death or "disability" and (ii) with respect to the share unit awards, amounts to which Mr. McGuinness would be entitled to upon a change in control or Listing Event occurring following a termination of employment on account of death or "disability." 
(2) Includes (i) amounts which would be payable by reason of accelerated vesting of RSU Awards upon a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control and (ii) amounts which would be payable by reason of accelerated vesting of share unit awards upon a qualifying termination of employment following the change in control or Listing Event. 
(3) Represents amounts to which NEOs would be entitled upon a qualifying termination of employment occurring on the date of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control, Listing Event or, retail sale, as applicable. In the event the NEO incurred a qualifying termination of employment beyond the 24 month period following a change in control, Listing Event or retail sale, as applicable, the executive would remain entitled to acceleration of unvested share unit awards (Mr. McGuinness), but not the change in control cash severance, reimbursement of COBRA premiums amounts or, unless the executive was terminated on account of death or disability, acceleration of unvested RSU Awards. 
(4) Represents a multiple of the sum of the NEO's annual base salary and target bonus for the year in which the qualifying termination occurs. The multiple varies by executive, and whether the executive's qualifying termination occurs on the date   of, or during the 24 month period following, a change in control. For Mr. Jaworski, represents the sum of 150% of his annual base salary, his target bonus and a pro-rated portion of his target bonus for the year in which the qualifying termination occurs. For additional details, see " -Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan" and "CIC Severance Plan" above. 
(5) Represents the aggregate value of the NEO's unvested RSUs which would vest in connection with the executive's termination of employment, calculated by multiplying the applicable number of RSUs subject to each RSU Award by $3.14, which is equal to the estimated value per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2018. 
(6) Represents the aggregate value of Mr. McGuinness' unvested share unit awards that would vest in connection with the change in control or Listing Event or his termination of employment, as applicable. Amounts represent the number of share units on the grant date multiplied by the estimated value of each share unit on the grant date as determined by our compensation committee by reference to the third-party valuation performed for the Company that was the most recent third-party evaluation available at the time of the grant. The estimated value of a share unit was determined based on a phantom capitalization of our retail business and does not directly correspond to the value of a share of common stock of the Company. Vesting of the share units is conditioned upon the occurrence of a triggering event, such as a Listing Event or a change in control of the business and, therefore, the market value of the share units cannot be definitively determined until the occurrence of such an event. 
(7) Represents reimbursement of COBRA premiums. The amounts associated with COBRA premiums were calculated using 2018 enrollment rates, multiplied by the maximum 18 month period during which the executive may be entitled to reimbursement of COBRA premiums. Mr. Jaworski did not participate in our group health plan as of December 31, 2018, and therefore no amount is included for him.  CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our median employee to the annual total compensation of Thomas McGuinness, our Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO"). We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For 2018, our last completed annual period: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee (other than our CEO)  was $102,173; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $3,830,014.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the annual total compensation of our CEO was approximately 37.49 times the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO). 
Determining the Median Employee 
Employee Population 
The Company used our employee population data as of December 1, 2018 as the reference date for identifying our median employee. As of such date, our employee population consisted of approximately 116 individuals. 
Methodology for Determining Our Median Employee 
To identify the median employee from our employee population, we used 2018 annual base salary, bonus earned in 2018 and any long term incentive stock awards granted in 2018. In identifying the median employee, we annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who were new-hires and/or on leave of absence in 2018. 
Compensation Measure and Annual Total Compensation of Median Employee 
With respect to the annual total compensation of the employee who represents our median compensated employee, we calculated such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. 
Annual Total Compensation of CEO 
With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.  COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT 
We believe that our compensation policies and practices appropriately balance near-term performance improvement with sustainable long-term value creation, and that they do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. In 2018, our management conducted an extensive review of the design and operation of our compensation program and presented their findings to the compensation committee. The review included an assessment of the level of risk associated with the various elements of compensation. Based on this review and assessment, we believe that our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT1 
The compensation committee of the board of directors of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (the "Company") has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Proxy Statement") and, based on such review and discussions, recommended to the board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Proxy Statement.

Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of these forms furnished to us during, and with respect to, the year ended December 31, 2018, or written representations that no additional forms were required, we believe that all of our executive officers and directors and persons that beneficially owned more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock complied with these filing requirements during the year ended December 31, 2018.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures with Respect to Related Party Transactions 
Our board of directors has adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our "related person policy." Our related person policy requires that management present to the audit committee any proposed "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any "related person" (as defined in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K)) had, has or will have a direct or indirect interest), including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. The audit committee will review the relevant facts and circumstances of each related person transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third party and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, take into account the conflicts of interest and corporate opportunity provisions of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, and either approve or disapprove the related person transaction. 
If advance audit committee approval of a related person transaction requiring the audit committee's approval is not feasible, then the transaction may be preliminarily entered into by management upon prior approval of the transaction by the chair of the audit committee subject to ratification of the transaction by the audit committee at the audit committee's next regularly scheduled meeting; provided, that if ratification shall not be forthcoming, management shall make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul such transaction. Any related person transaction shall be consummated and shall continue only if the audit committee has approved or ratified such transaction in accordance with Section 2-419 of Maryland Code, Corporations and Associations (if applicable), or any successor provision thereto, our charter and bylaws and the guidelines set forth in the related person policy.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT1
The audit committee of the board of directors of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (the "Company") assists the board of directors in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, the reporting process and maintaining an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's independent auditors are engaged to audit and express opinions on the conformity of the Company's financial statements to United States generally accepted accounting principles. 
In addition to fulfilling its oversight responsibilities as set forth in its charter and further described in the section of the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders titled "Audit Committee," the audit committee has performed the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year  ended December 31, 2018, reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG LLP ("KPMG") the Company's audited consolidated financial statements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  ("PCAOB"), as adopted in Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), and any other matters required to be communicated to the committee by KPMG under auditing standards established from time to time by the PCAOB  or SEC rules and regulations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluated KPMG's qualifications, performance and independence (consistent with SEC requirements), which  included the receipt and review of the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG's communications with the audit committee concerning independence and discussions with KPMG  regarding its independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the reviews and discussions with management and KPMG cited above, including the review of KPMG's disclosures and letter to the audit committee and review of the representations of management and the reports of KPMG, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2 – RATIFY APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP 
The audit committee has selected KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection. 
KPMG also served as our independent registered accounting firm for year ended December 31, 2018. Representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make such statements as they may desire. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, the board of directors is submitting the selection of KPMG to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance practice. Furthermore, the audit committee will take the results of the stockholder vote regarding KPMG's appointment into consideration in future deliberations. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. Our board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Fees to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, together with fees for audit-related services and tax services rendered by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

 TOTAL      1,162,107           $ 1,444,344   
[END TABLE]
(1) Audit fees consist principally of fees paid for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and review of our consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports. 
(2) Tax fees are comprised of tax compliance and consulting fees. 
Approval of Services and Fees 
Our audit committee, or the chairperson of our audit committee, must pre-approve any audit and non-audit service provided to us by the independent auditor, unless the engagement is entered into pursuant to appropriate pre-approval policies established by the audit committee or if such service falls within available exceptions under SEC rules. If approved by the chairperson of the audit committee, such approval will be presented to the audit committee at its next meeting. The audit committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to approve audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that the decision of the subcommittee to approve any service shall be presented to the full audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
The audit committee has reviewed and approved all of the fees charged by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and actively monitors the relationship between audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG. The audit committee concluded that all services rendered by KPMG during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were consistent with maintaining KPMG's independence. As a matter of policy, we will not engage our primary independent registered public accounting firm for non-audit services other than "audit-related services," as defined by the SEC, certain tax services and other permissible non-audit services that are specifically approved as described above.  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
The deadline has passed to submit any proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting. We have not received any timely stockholder proposals for inclusion in this year's proxy statement. 
Nominations of Director Candidates for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Stockholder nominations of director candidates must be submitted in advance to the Company in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 9(a) of Article II of our current bylaws. Generally, this requires that the stockholder send certain information about the candidate to our secretary not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day and not earlier than the 150th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. For our annual meeting to be held in 2020, a stockholder must provide written notice of a candidate nomination not earlier than October 13, 2019 and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 12, 2019, to our corporate secretary, c/o InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515.

A copy of our bylaws may be obtained by written request to our corporate secretary at the same address. Additional information regarding director nominations is included above under the heading Corporate Governance Principles – Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Other Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Stockholders intending to present any other proposal for action by the stockholders at an annual meeting are subject to the same notice provisions under our bylaws for director candidate nominations as discussed above. Accordingly, for our annual meeting to be held in 2020, a stockholder must provide written notice to the Company of a proposal not earlier than October 13, 2019 and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 12, 2019. 
Our bylaws do not change the deadline for a stockholder seeking to include a proposal in our proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act or affect a stockholder's right to present for action at an annual meeting any proposal so included. Rule 14a-8 requires that notice of a stockholder proposal requested to be included in our proxy materials pursuant to that Rule must generally be furnished to our corporate secretary not later than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of our proxy statement for the previous year's annual meeting. For our annual meeting to be held in 2020, stockholder proposals to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 must be received by our corporate secretary no later than November 12, 2019. 
Each of these stockholder proposals should be submitted in writing and addressed to our corporate secretary, c/o InvenTrust Properties Corp., 3025 Highland Parkway, Suite 350, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515.  ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS
