PROXY STATEMENT 
January 7, 2019 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
February  20, 2019 
SOLICITATION AND VOTING RIGHTS 
The accompanying proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Powell Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Wednesday, February 20, 2019, at 11:00 a.m., Houston time, at the offices of the Company at 7232 Airport Boulevard in Houston, Texas 77061, or at any adjournment thereof. 
This Proxy Statement, proxy and the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended September 30, 2018, including consolidated financial statements, will be mailed to stockholders on or about January 7, 2019. The Board has fixed January 3, 2019, as the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 3, 2019, there were 11,516,148 shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), outstanding. Each holder of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote for each share owned, except as noted below. 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting. Brokers holding shares of record for their customers generally are not entitled to vote on certain matters unless they receive voting instructions from their customers. When brokers complete proxy forms, they generally vote on those matters as to which they are entitled to vote. On those matters as to which brokers are not entitled to vote without instructions from their customers and have not received such instructions, brokers generally indicate on their proxies that they lack voting authority as to those matters. As to those matters, such indications are called "broker non-votes." 
The vote of a plurality of the shares entitled to vote and represented at a meeting at which a quorum is present is required for the election of directors. The persons receiving the greatest number of votes cast at the meeting to fill the directorships with terms to expire in 2022 will be elected as directors of the Company, class of 2022. Thus, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors. The proposal related to the non-binding approval of executive compensation is advisory only and therefore does not require a particular number of affirmative votes. Although the advisory vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the compensation committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") values the opinions of the Company's stockholders, and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation arrangements. 
Shares of the Common Stock present or represented at the Annual Meeting that abstain from voting or that are the subject of broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
The shares represented by each valid proxy received by the Company on the form solicited by the Board will be voted in accordance with instructions specified on the proxy. A stockholder giving a duly executed proxy may revoke it before it is exercised by filing with or transmitting to the Secretary of the Company an instrument or transmission revoking it, or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. 
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of this Proxy Statement, directors, officers and employees of the Company may solicit the return of proxies by mail, personal interview, telephone or the Internet. Officers and employees of the Company will not receive additional compensation for their solicitation efforts, but they will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries will be requested, in connection with the stock registered in their names, to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of such stock. 
All costs of preparing, printing, assembling and mailing the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, this Proxy Statement, the enclosed form of proxy and any additional materials, as well as the cost of forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of stock and all other costs of solicitation, will be borne by the Company. 
Delivery of One Proxy Statement and Annual Report to a Single Household to Reduce Duplicate Mailings 
Each year in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders, the Company is required to send to each stockholder of record a proxy statement and annual report, and to arrange for a proxy statement and annual report to be sent to each beneficial stockholder whose shares are held by or in the name of a broker, bank, trust or other nominee. Because some stockholders hold shares of Common Stock in multiple accounts, this process results in duplicate mailings of proxy statements and annual reports to stockholders who share the same address. Stockholders may avoid receiving duplicate mailings and save the Company the cost of producing and mailing duplicate documents as follows: 
Stockholders of Record.    If your shares are registered in your own name and you are interested in consenting to the delivery of a single proxy statement or annual report, you may contact the Company by mail at 8550 Mosley Road, Houston, Texas 77075 or by telephone at (713) 947-4422. 
Beneficial Stockholders.    If your shares are not registered in your own name, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee that holds your shares may have asked you to consent to the delivery of a single proxy statement or annual report if there are other stockholders of the Company who share an address with you. If you currently receive more than one proxy statement or annual report at your household, and would like to receive only one copy of each in the future, you should contact your nominee. 
Right to Request Separate Copies.    If you consent to the delivery of a single proxy statement and annual report but later decide that you would prefer to receive a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, for each stockholder sharing your address, then please notify the Company or your nominee, as applicable, and the Company or your nominee will promptly deliver such additional proxy statements or annual reports. If you wish to receive a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report for each stockholder sharing your address in the future, you may contact the Company by mail at 8550 Mosley Road, Houston, Texas 77075 or by telephone at (713) 947-4422.  PROPOSAL NO. 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The terms of three directors are scheduled to expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified under the Company's bylaws. The terms of the remaining directors continue after the Annual Meeting. The Nominating and Governance Committee has nominated Brett A. Cope, Thomas W. Powell and Richard E. Williams for election as directors with terms scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2022 or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Messrs. Cope, Powell and Williams currently serve as directors of the Company. 
Although the Board does not contemplate that any nominee will be unable to serve, if such a situation arises prior to the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote in accordance with their best judgment for a substitute nominee. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
The Board recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the election of each of the nominees. 
PROPOSAL NO. 2 
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the preference for annual non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation expressed by the Company's stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board is providing the stockholders with the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the Company's executive compensation (commonly known as "say-on-pay") through consideration of the following non-binding advisory resolution: 
"Resolved, that the stockholders approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this proxy statement." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making decisions regarding future executive compensation arrangements. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation. Unless otherwise indicated on your proxy, your shares will be voted FOR the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The following table sets forth for each nominee and for each director whose term of office continues after the Annual Meeting, his or her name, age as of the date of the Annual Meeting, principal occupation and employment for the past five years, offices held with the Company, the date he or she first became a director, and the date of expiration of his or her current term as director.

Board Structure, Committee Composition and Meetings 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board was comprised of eight members, divided into three classes. 
The Board is comprised of a majority of independent directors. The Board has determined that, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, Ms. Bonnie V. Hancock and Messrs. Christopher E. Cragg, Perry L. Elders, Thomas W. Powell, James W. McGill, John D. White and Mr. Richard E. Williams, are "Independent Directors" as such term is defined by Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and that the current members   of the audit committee are also independent for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"). The Board based its determinations of independence primarily on a review of the responses the directors provided to questions regarding employment and compensation history, affiliations and family and other relationships. 
Six meetings of the Board were held during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"). No incumbent director attended fewer than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings of the Board and (2) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board during the period that such director served on such committees. 
It is the Company's policy that directors attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on February 21, 2018, all of the Company's directors at that date were present. Stockholders may communicate with directors of the Company by writing to them at the Company's headquarters. Communications addressed to the Board will be reviewed by the Secretary of the Company and directed to the members of the Board for their consideration. 
Committees, Memberships and Meetings 
The Board has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board may also establish other committees from time to time as necessary to facilitate the management of the business and affairs of the Company and to comply with the corporate governance rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities as to accounting policies and reporting practices of the Company and all subsidiaries and the sufficiency of the audits of all Company activities. It is the Board's agent in ensuring the integrity of financial reports of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the adequacy of disclosures to stockholders. The Audit Committee is the focal point for communication among other directors, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal audit and management as their duties relate to financial accounting, reporting and controls. The Audit Committee Charter does not expressly permit the Audit Committee to delegate its authority. The Audit Committee held four meetings during Fiscal 2018 and all meetings of the Audit Committee were separate and apart from meetings of the full Board. 
The Audit Committee is comprised of Perry L. Elders, Christopher E. Cragg and Richard E. Williams. The Board has determined that each of Messrs. Elders and Cragg qualify as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, and that each member of the Audit Committee is an independent director. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website, powellind.com, under the section entitled "Investor Relations." The Audit Committee has been structured to comply with the requirements of Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee provides oversight on behalf of the full Board on development and administration of the Company's executive compensation program and all subcomponent plans in which officers or directors are eligible to participate. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the Company's   compensation practices, including the methodologies for setting the total compensation for senior management and officers. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining compensation paid to the executive officers and for reviewing and recommending director compensation to the Board. 
The Compensation Committee also strives to make the Company's compensation competitive by comparing the Company's practices and compensation levels against the results of surveys of related-industry companies. The Compensation Committee has the authority to directly engage independent consultants and periodically utilizes consultants to provide advice and recommendations regarding executive compensation. The Compensation Committee has the flexibility to exercise its independent judgment when establishing compensation policies, especially when rewarding individual performance. The Compensation Committee Charter does not expressly permit the Compensation Committee to delegate its authority. 
The Compensation Committee is comprised of Christopher E. Cragg, Bonnie V. Hancock and James W. McGill. The Compensation Committee held four meetings during Fiscal 2018. A copy of the Compensation Committee Charter is available on the Company's website, powellind.com, under the section entitled "Investor Relations." 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for selecting director nominees for election by the stockholders to fill directorships with expiring terms and for appointing new members to the Board to fill unexpired terms of directorships vacated during the terms. Annually, the Nominating and Governance Committee is also responsible for establishing director qualifications and the selection criteria for new directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends to the Board a slate of directors to serve on each standing committee of the Board and recommends one member of each standing committee to serve as chairman of the committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the adherence to the Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by the Board. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is comprised of John D. White, James W. McGill and Richard E. Williams. During Fiscal 2018, the Committee held five meetings. In December 2018, the Nominating and Governance Committee met and discussed the current director candidates, and recommended to the Board the election of the three candidates nominated above. A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter is available on the Company's website, powellind.com, under the section entitled "Investor Relations." 
Director Compensation 
The Company uses a combination of cash and equity based compensation in the form of restricted stock to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. In setting director compensation, the Company considers the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill level required by the Company of members of the Board. Only directors who are not employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are entitled to receive a fee or reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses for their services as directors.  For Fiscal 2018, compensation for non-employee directors was comprised of the following components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Quarterly Retainer — Chairman of the Board          $ 21,500         
 Quarterly Retainer — Audit Committee Chair          $ 12,000         
 Quarterly Retainer — Compensation Committee Chair          $ 11,000         
 Quarterly Retainer — Nominating and Governance Committee Chair          $ 10,500         
 Quarterly Retainer — All other directors          $ 9,000         
 Committee Meeting Fees      Audit      $ 1,500         
 (For each meeting attended)      Compensation      $ 1,000         
 Annual Restricted Stock Award (shares)                  2,000   
[END TABLE]
In addition to the above, the Company reimburses expenses related to attendance at meetings to non-employee directors. 
The Company has stock ownership guidelines for its non-employee directors. Under these guidelines, each non-employee director is required to own and hold a minimum of 6,000 vested or unvested shares of the Company. Each non-employee director has three years to comply with the stock ownership guidelines and all non-employee directors are in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. 
The stockholders voted at the February 26, 2014, meeting to approve the 2014 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan (the "Director Plan"). The total number of shares of Common Stock reserved under the plan is 150,000 shares. The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Eligibility to participate in the plan is limited to those individuals who are members of the Board of the Company and who are not employees of the Company or any affiliate of the Company. 
Under the terms of the Director Plan, the maximum number of shares subject to stock options and stock appreciation rights that may be granted during any calendar year to any individual under the Director Plan is 12,000 shares. The total number of shares that may be issued for awards to any single participant during a calendar year for other stock-based awards (excluding stock options and SARs) is 4,000 shares. The Compensation Committee has determined that each non-employee director will receive 2,000 restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock annually.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL 2018

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Company has established Corporate Governance Guidelines, which may be found on the Governance page of the Company's website, powellind.com. The Corporate Governance Guidelines include the definition of independence used by the Company to determine whether its directors and nominees for directors are independent, which are the same qualifications prescribed under the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company's non-management directors are required to meet in separate sessions without management on a regularly scheduled basis four times a year. Generally, these meetings occur as an executive session without the management director in attendance in conjunction with regularly scheduled meetings of the Board throughout the year. From time to time during executive sessions, the independent directors meet with individual members of senior management. Because the Chairman of the Board is a member of management, the separate non-management sessions are presided over by an independent director elected by a majority of the non-management directors. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Chairman of the Board is elected by the Board on an annual basis. Mr. Powell currently serves as Chairman. The Board has determined that Mr. Powell should continue to serve in the role of Chairman based on   various factors. First, as the Company's long-time Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. Powell's leadership and vision for the Company as well as his extensive knowledge and experience of the electrical manufacturing business derived from his decades of experience as CEO have been instrumental in its development. Second, Mr. Powell is uniquely qualified to be the Company's Chairman because he has years of experience in that role. Third, Mr. Powell has the confidence of the Board, the Company and its stockholders to continue to oversee the implementation of the Company's business plan. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board utilizes the Company's risk management process to assist in fulfilling its oversight of the Company's risks. . In its risk oversight role, the Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. A fundamental aspect of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the company. The involvement of the full Board in approving the Company's business plans as promoted by management is a key part of its assessment of management's appetite for risk and also a determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. 
While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk exposures, including internal controls, and discusses with management and the Company's independent auditor the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Audit Committee also assists the Board in fulfilling its duties and oversight responsibilities relating to the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with conflict-of-interest issues that may arise. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs. At least annually, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers risks related to corporate governance. 
Risk Assessment in Compensation Programs 
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual risk assessment to determine whether the Company's compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This risk assessment process for Fiscal 2017 included: a review of program policies and practices; program analysis to identify risk and risk control related to the programs; and determinations as to the sufficiency of risk identification, the balance of potential risk to potential reward, risk control and the support of the programs and their risks to company strategy. Although the Compensation Committee reviewed all compensation programs, it focused on the programs with variability of payout, with the ability of a participant to directly affect payout and the controls on participant action and payout. 
The Compensation Committee took the following risk considerations into account in developing the incentive plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive plan metrics are aligned with our business strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance objectives are balanced with the quality and sustainability of business results;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full range of potential payouts under each plan is understood;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short term incentive payouts are capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long term incentive payouts are capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leverage and ratio of incentive compensation to salary and total compensation are understood;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance, structure and target incentive plan opportunities are comparable to those of industry or peers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee may exercise discretion where appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's focus on long-term performance aligns with stockholder interests, and incentives are  calculated over a time horizon that takes into account the risk horizon; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses material risks when considering incentive programs.   
[END TABLE]
Further to emphasize the alignment of our named executive officers' interest with the interests of our stockholders, the Company has adopted the following policies and programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership policy for executives ranging from 1 to 5 times base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to recoup compensation paid to an executive in the event the Company's financial statements are  restated and such restatement resulted from material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit an executive from engaging in a transaction to purchase a hedging instrument that protects  the executive from downward changes in the Company's stock price;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy that generally prohibits an executive from pledging stock of the Company that is otherwise held by him  or her;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit an executive from holding stock of the Company in a margin account;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit the use of excise tax gross-ups in executive  employment agreements, commencing with executive employment agreements entered into on or after October 1, 2013; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adoption of a limit on the number of shares that may be earned by each executive under long-term incentive  awards, which replaces a prior compensation practice of no share limitation.  
[END TABLE]
The above policies and procedures are designed to, among others, mitigate risk that any of our compensation policies or practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
We believe that our incentive compensation programs provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization's ability to effectively identify and manage significant risks; are compatible with effective internal controls and the risk-management practices of the Company; and are supported by the oversight and administration of the Compensation Committee with regard to executive compensation programs. Based on the foregoing, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Company reviews any transaction exceeding $120,000 between the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and any of our directors, executive officers or any of their immediate family members or any nominee for director or a holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities. The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires disclosure by directors of any situation that involves, or may reasonably be inferred to involve, a conflict between a director's personal interests and the interests of the Company. The Company's practice when such matters have been disclosed has been to refer the matter for consideration and final determination by the Audit Committee or the independent directors of the Board, or both, who then consider the fairness of the transaction to the Company, as well as other factors bearing upon its appropriateness. In all such matters, any director having a conflicting interest abstains from voting on the matters. 
Code of Ethics 
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including its executive officers, and directors. A copy of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may be obtained at the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, powellind.com, or by written request addressed to the Secretary, Powell Industries, Inc., 8550 Mosley Road, Houston, Texas 77075. The Company intends to satisfy the requirements under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding disclosure of amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that apply to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer by posting such information on the Company's website. 
Communications with the Board 
The Board, comprised of a majority of independent directors, has unanimously approved a process for stockholders, or other interested persons, to communicate with the Board. This process is located on the Governance page of the Company's website, powellind.com. The relevant document is titled "Procedures for Communication with Directors." 
In addition, stockholders, or other interested persons, wishing to communicate with the Board for anonymous complaints about accounting, internal accounting control and auditing issues may call the Company's toll-free governance hotline at 1-877-888-0002. The Audit Committee monitors these calls. All calls are documented, and those reports that are deemed to be substantive will be passed on to the Board. Stockholders, or other interested persons, calling the hotline should provide a sufficiently detailed description of the nature of the matter that the person wishes to communicate with the Board, as well as a name, telephone number, email address, or other contact information so that the Company can either respond to the communication or obtain additional information about the matter. 
Nomination Process 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider written recommendations from stockholders for nominees for director. Any such nominations should be submitted to the Nominating and Governance Committee c/o the Secretary, Powell Industries, Inc., 8550 Mosley Road, Houston, TX 77075 and should be accompanied by the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the  Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name(s) and address(es) of the stockholder(s) making the nomination and the number of shares of the  Company's Common Stock which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder(s); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appropriate biographical information and a statement as to the qualifications of the nominee.   
[END TABLE]
The written recommendation should be submitted in the time frame described under the caption "Stockholder Proposals" below. 
Nominees for director are selected on the basis of a number of qualifications including their independence, knowledge, judgment, character, leadership skills, education, experience, financial literacy, standing in the community and ability to foster a diversity of backgrounds and views and to complement the Board's existing strengths. The Nominating and Governance Committee initiates the process for identifying and evaluating nominees to the Board by preparing a slate of candidates who meet the criteria for selection as a nominee and have specific qualities or skills being sought based on input from members of the Board. When formulating its recommendations for potential Board nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee seeks and considers advice and recommendations from management and other members of the Board and may seek or consider advice and recommendations from consultants, outside counsel, accountants or other advisors as the Nominating and Governance Committee or the Board may deem appropriate. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the candidates by reviewing their biographical information and qualifications, with qualified nominees being interviewed by at least one member of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Members of the Board also have an opportunity to interview qualified nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee then determines, based on the background information and the information obtained in the interviews, whether to recommend to the Board that a nominee be nominated to fill a directorship with an expiring term. Candidates recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee to fill a directorship with an expiring term are presented to the Board for selection as nominees to be presented for the approval of the stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee anticipates that a similar process will be used to evaluate nominees recommended by stockholders, but has not previously received a stockholder recommendation for a nominee for director. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for appointing new members to the Board to fill the unexpired term of a directorship vacated during the term or new directorships created by any increase in the size of the Board. 
Board membership criteria, which are disclosed in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines on the Governance page of the Company's website, powellind.com, are determined by the Board with input from the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board is responsible for periodically determining the appropriate skills, perspectives, experiences and characteristics required of Board candidates, taking into account the Company's needs and current makeup of the Board. This assessment should include appropriate knowledge, experience and skills in areas deemed critical to understanding the Company and its business, the candidate's commitments to the boards of other companies, and personal characteristics, such as integrity and judgment. Each Board member is expected to ensure that other existing and planned future commitments do not materially interfere with the member's service as a director and that he or she devotes the time necessary to discharge his or her duties as a director. It is the Board's opinion that the qualification guidelines included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines are currently appropriate, but it may change these guidelines as the Company's and Board's needs warrant. The Board established the age of 75 as the age after which an independent director will not stand for reelection at the end of such director's then current term and has established five as the maximum number of consecutive terms a director may serve. The Board has waived these restrictions for Mr. Powell.  Practices for Considering Diversity 
The minimum criteria for selection of members to serve on our Board ensures that the Nominating and Governance Committee selects director nominees taking into consideration that the Board will benefit from having directors that represent a diversity of experience and backgrounds. Director nominees are selected so that the Board represents a diversity of experience in areas needed to foster the Company's business success, including experience in the electrical equipment and energy industries, engineering, manufacturing, finance, consulting, international affairs, public service, governance and regulatory compliance. Each year the Board and each committee participates in a self-assessment or evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its committees as a group. These evaluations assess the diversity of talents, expertise, and occupational and personal backgrounds of the Board members. 
Director Qualifications 
When identifying director nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The person's reputation, integrity and independence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The person's skills and business, government or other professional experience and acumen, bearing in mind  the composition of the Board and the current state of the Company and the electrical distribution and energy industries generally at the time of determination;

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This compensation discussion and analysis describes the design and purpose of our compensation programs applicable to our officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table. We refer to these officers as our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"). For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"), they include Mr. Brett A Cope, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Don R. Madison, former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, Secretary and Treasurer; and Mr. Milburn E. Honeycutt, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The Compensation Committee of the Board has responsibility for establishing, implementing and continually monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy. 
Overview 
Our executive compensation program covering our NEOs is designed to attract and retain critical executive talent, to motivate behaviors that align with stockholders' interests and to pay for performance. The majority of our NEOs' pay is variable and contingent on performance. 
For Fiscal 2018, the Company has structured its compensation programs so that the annual cash incentive program is 100% performance-based and 40% of annual grants of equity vest based on targets established by the Compensation Committee. The Company has adopted a peer group comprising companies that operate primarily in Powell's industry and are of reasonably comparable size. To ensure pay is competitive with market practices, we conduct periodic studies that, in conjunction with individual performance assessments, are used to assist in determining the total target direct compensation of our NEOs. 
It is the judgement of the Compensation Committee that the judicious use of relevant market surveys and the structuring of performance-based compensation communicate the Company's commitment to reasonable compensation opportunities for the Company's executive officers that are consistent with returns realized by stockholders. Further, to emphasize the alignment of our NEOs' interests with the interests of our stockholders, the Company has adopted the following policies and programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership policy for executives ranging from 1 to 5 times base salary. While all executives are in  compliance with the Company's policy, Brett Cope has not yet reached the ownership target due to his time in position;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A recoupment policy, to recoup compensation paid to an executive in the event the Company's financial  statements are restated and such restatement resulted from material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit an executive from engaging in a transaction to purchase a hedging instrument that protects  the executive from downward changes in the Company's stock price;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy that generally prohibits an executive from pledging stock of the Company that is otherwise held by him  or her;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit an executive from holding Company stock in a margin account;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A policy to prohibit the use of excise tax gross-ups in executive  employment agreements, commencing with executive employment agreements entered into on or after October 1, 2013; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adoption of a limit on the number of shares that may be earned by each executive under long-term incentive  awards, which replaces a prior compensation practice of no share limitation.  
[END TABLE]
Finally, the Compensation Committee took the following considerations into account in developing the incentive plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive plan metrics are aligned with our business strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance objectives are balanced with the quality and sustainability of business results;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full range of potential payouts under each plan is understood;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentive payouts are capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive payouts are capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leverage and ratio of incentive compensation to salary and total compensation are understood;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance, structure and target incentive plan opportunities are comparable to those of the industry or peers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee may exercise discretion where appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's focus on long-term performance aligns executives with stockholder interests, and incentives  are determined over a time horizon that is consistent with the Company's business cycle; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses material risks when considering incentive programs.   
[END TABLE]
Our Fiscal 2018 Performance 
Although target incentive opportunities are set by reference to market data, the incentive plan terms provide for actual payouts to be based upon actual performance results. For Fiscal 2018, short-term incentives were paid at above target levels for the NEOs as performance results exceeded the Company's established goal. For Fiscal 2018, long-term equity incentives were awarded below target because the Company's performance results over the three year period ending September 30, 2018 fell short of the Company's target performance established by the Board of Directors. 
Executive Total Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
The Compensation Committee works to ensure that the total compensation paid to the Company's executive team is fair, reasonable and competitive. 
The Compensation Committee's philosophy regarding the executive compensation program for our NEOs has been to provide compensation structured to maximize shareholder value by aligning the short-term and long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our investors. Our programs are intended to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, motivate, reward and retain key executive talent required to achieve corporate strategic objectives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforce the relationship between strong individual performance of executives and business results; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage our executives to focus on both the short-term and long-term performance of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
The compensation offered by the Company to its officers is intended to be competitive within the markets in which we compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee considers market reference points developed from peer company data and surveys and uses this information to assure that compensation programs are sufficient to attract and retain executive talent. 
Compensation programs are designed so that a significant portion of executive pay opportunities are "at risk," meaning that the ultimate compensation realized by our NEOs is tied to the Company's financial and equity performance. In structuring incentive pay, the Compensation Committee is mindful that incentive programs should be reflective of the market conditions in which the Company operates while not encouraging excessive risk taking. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee structures programs that are designed to balance short-term results and long-term, multi-year outcomes. 
The response from the Company's stockholders at the annual meetings held in 2018 in regard to the advisory vote relating to compensation paid to executives was positive. Nevertheless, the Compensation Committee will, as a matter of practice, continually review the effectiveness and appropriateness of compensation practices and make adjustments based on internal considerations and external input as required and has responded as described in the "Overview" above. 
Committee Overview 
The Compensation Committee is comprised of Ms. Hancock and Messrs. Cragg and McGill. Mr. Cragg serves as the Compensation Committee's Chairman. Each member of the Compensation Committee is considered to be (1) "independent" under the currently applicable listing standards of the NASDAQ; (2) a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act; and (3) an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. 
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all compensation elements for the NEOs, including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). In fulfilling its duties, the Compensation Committee considers information and recommendations from the CEO and may, under its charter, engage the services of an independent compensation consultant. 
The Compensation Committee has engaged the services of independent consultants. Prior to entering into such engagements, the Compensation Committee determined that the consultant(s) met the independence criteria under guidelines adopted by the NASDAQ in regards to compensation committee advisor independence and (ii) the consultant's work did not raise any conflicts of interest. Under the scope of past engagements, these consultant(s) have advised the Compensation Committee on market compensation levels and incentive plan matters. 
The Compensation Committee works with the Company's CEO to establish an agenda for each meeting of the Compensation Committee and to prepare meeting materials. The Compensation Committee on occasion meets with the Company's CEO and other executives to obtain recommendations with respect to the Company's compensation programs and practices. Although management makes recommendations to the Compensation   Committee regarding compensation of NEOs, the Compensation Committee is not bound by and does not always accept management's recommendations. While our CEO attends Compensation Committee meetings, he is not present during voting or deliberations with respect to his compensation. The Compensation Committee also regularly holds executive sessions not attended by members of management or non-independent directors. 
Executive Compensation Elements 
The Company's executive compensation program is comprised of the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-Term Cash Incentive Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Compensation Plan, or LTCP; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benefits and Certain Perquisites.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary.    The Company pays base salaries to executive officers in order to compensate them for day-to-day services rendered to the Company over the course of each year. Salaries for executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. In determining individual salaries, the Compensation Committee considers the scope of the executive's job responsibilities, unique skill sets and experience, individual contributions, market conditions, current compensation as compared to the results of peer analyses and surveys of related-industry companies, as well as the specific actions and strategic activities of such executive officer for the prior year. In particular, the Compensation Committee reviews the CEO's job performance for the prior year, from both a quantitative aspect and a qualitative aspect as noted below under "Compensation Opportunities for Fiscal 2018." 
Short-Term Cash Incentive Compensation.    The Company utilizes cash incentive pay in order to incentivize the achievement of specific operating and financial objectives that are determined on an annual basis. The methodology for determining annual cash incentive pay is identical for each of our NEOs. 
Long-Term Compensation.    It is the Company's opinion that the interests of stockholders are best served when a portion of employee compensation is tied to the long-term performance of the Company and the value realized by its investors. Pursuant to the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and other equity-based awards. Recently, the Company has used time and performance-vesting restricted stock unit awards as a means to incentivize long-term employment and performance and to align individual compensation with the objective of building long-term stockholder value. 
The Compensation Committee's goal is to make all annual compensation decisions, including approval of equity awards to NEOs, at its regularly scheduled September meeting. These awards become effective upon the Board of Director's approval of the Company's annual operating plan. 
Benefits and Certain Perquisites.    The Company provides its NEOs with a very limited number of perquisites that the Compensation Committee believes are reasonable and consistent with its overall goal of offering competitive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites provided to the NEOs to assure they remain reasonable and appropriate. 
401(k) Plan.    Powell Industries, Inc. 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees, including the NEOs, are eligible to participate. Key elements of the plan include: participants   may elect to make contributions on a pre-tax basis, contributions are limited by the Code, the Company matches 50% of the first 6% of pay that is contributed to the savings plan, and all employee contributions vest immediately. NEOs participate in the 401(k) Plan on the same basis as other employees of the Company. 
Deferred Compensation Plan.    The NEOs are eligible to participate in the Powell Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, which is a non-qualified, unfunded retirement savings plan intended to comply with Code Section 409A in terms of its design and administration. This Plan provides the opportunity to increase deferrals of base salary and to elect deferrals of annual cash incentive compensation awards. Key elements of the plan include: participants can contribute up to 50% of their base salary and 100% of their short-term cash incentive compensation awards in excess of the amounts eligible to be contributed to the Company's 401(k) Plan. Base salary and short-term cash incentive compensation deferrals are eligible for an employer matching contribution. Employee contributions and earnings credits on account balances vest immediately. 
Factors Considered When Determining Total Compensation 
Peer Group Information.    The Compensation Committee sets base salaries and short-term and long-term incentive target levels based in part on market reference points that reflect its consultant's analysis of the compensation practices of a peer group of companies in similar industries, of reasonably similar size and with comparable business cycles. Additional market information may be considered using survey data obtained from Equilar, Inc. While the Company does not use the median of market practice as a reference point, it does consider the market median as an informal benchmark for measuring the overall competitiveness of executives' total compensation opportunity given each individual's performance, qualifications and experience and the performance of the Company. 
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee made a thorough review of the companies that had comprised the peer group in prior years and determined that no changes in its composition were necessary. It is the Compensation Committee's intent to routinely review the make-up of the peer group and, in consultation with its independent consultant, to make adjustments to the composition of the group as deemed appropriate. The companies approved as the Fiscal 2018 peer group are listed below. 
Compensation Peer Group for Fiscal 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Altra Industrial Motion Corporation    Ameresco, Inc.    A. O. Smith Corporation

 Littelfuse, Inc.    LSI Industries, Inc.    Preformed Line Products Company 
 McDermott International, Inc.    Thermon Group Holdings, Inc.    Woodward, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
External Market Conditions and Individual Factors.    In addition to using peer and survey data, the Compensation Committee also takes into account external market conditions and individual factors when establishing the total compensation of each NEO. Some of these factors include the executive's performance, level of experience, tenure and responsibilities and position, in addition to competitive pressures for that position within the industry, economic developments, the condition of labor markets and the financial and market performance of the Company. The Compensation Committee uses tally sheets that outline the executive's   historical and proposed compensation. The Compensation Committee also considers internal equity when evaluating the compensation of our NEOs relative to one another. 
The Company has adopted the following policies to assure that executives' interests are aligned with those of stockholders, that there is a mechanism to recover compensation when this payment was not consistent with Company policy and to mitigate against risks inherent in compensation programs: 
Executive Incentive Award Recoupment Policy 
The Company has adopted a policy that (i) in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial results (a "Restatement") due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement or misconduct by an executive or (ii) in the event no Restatement is required but the Board determines an executive engaged in misconduct that contributed to inaccurate operation metrics; with (i) or (ii) resulting in any performance-based compensation paid during the 12 months preceding such Restatement that would have been lower had it been calculated based on such restated results, the Compensation Committee may, to the extent practicable and permitted by applicable law, seek to recover from such executive all of the incentive compensation paid to such executive or credited to such executive's deferred compensation account for the relevant period. 
Executive Stock Ownership Policy 
The Company has adopted an executive stock ownership policy to (i) emphasize the link between the Company's executives and the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders and (ii) enhance the image of the Company by openly communicating to investors, lenders, market analysts and the public that the interests of the Company's executives are directly tied to the long-term success of the Company through personal capital investment in stock of the Company. Pursuant the Company's stock ownership policy, certain executives are expected to accumulate and retain shares of the Company's stock in order to achieve target ownership levels that are one to five times the executive's base salary, depending on the executive's position and title with the Company. 
For Fiscal 2018 the ownership targets were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 President and Chief Executive Officer    5 times base salary 
 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer    3 times base salary 
 Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer    1 times base salary 
[END TABLE]
Executive Hedging and Pledging Policy 
The Company has adopted a policy that prohibits certain executives from (i) engaging in any transaction to purchase hedging instruments that protect against downward changes in the Company's stock price or (ii) holding securities of the Company in a margin account or pledging securities of the Company as collateral for any other loan. Shares subject to the Executive Hedging and Pledging Policy are limited to shares of the Company's Common Stock that are subject to the Executive Stock Ownership Policy. In limited circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, an exception to the prohibition described in "(ii)" above may be granted by the Chief Executive Officer (or the Compensation Committee if the executive in question is the Chief Executive Officer).  How the Company Determines Changes in Compensation for Named Executive Officers 
Chief Executive Officer.    The Compensation Committee evaluates the CEO's performance based on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's financial performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The accomplishment of long-term strategic objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The development of the Company's top management team;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Specific objectives assigned to the CEO; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership accomplishments.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers the performance of the CEO compared to objectives and the general economic environment when determining his compensation. The Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that the views of the Board with respect to the performance of the CEO are reviewed and discussed with him on a periodic basis. The Compensation Committee makes final decisions regarding the CEO's compensation. 
Other Named Executive Officers.    Each year the CEO submits to the Compensation Committee a performance assessment and compensation recommendation for each of the other NEO's. The CEO also participates in the discussions with the Compensation Committee prior to their approval of compensation for such officers. The performance evaluation is based on factors such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of individual and the Company's objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Contribution to the Company's performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership accomplishments.  
[END TABLE]
While the Compensation Committee gives weight to the views of the CEO on executive compensation matters, the Compensation Committee may take other considerations into account. Ultimately, final compensation determinations are made at the Compensation Committee's discretion. 
Compensation Opportunities for Fiscal 2018 
The base salary, short-term incentive opportunity and long-term incentive opportunity established for each of our NEOs are intended to provide total target compensation appropriately positioned competitively for individuals in comparable positions and in markets in which we compete for executive talent. Consistent with our objectives, 67% of our CEO's total target pay opportunity is offered in the form of short-term and long-term incentives. The following table shows Fiscal 2018 target direct compensation opportunities for our NEOs: 
Target Pay Opportunity for Fiscal 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Salary and Total Pay Opportunity.    In September 2017, the Compensation Committee considered whether adjustments to NEO salaries and incentive opportunities were appropriate for Fiscal 2018. After review, all NEO salaries and incentive opportunities were left unchanged for Fiscal 2018. 
Short-Term Incentives.    In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the use of EBITDA and working capital as the determinant of short-term cash incentive compensation for Fiscal 2018. The table below sets forth the short-term cash incentive compensation opportunity for each NEO.

The amounts set forth below show the target values for achieving the threshold, target and maximum levels established for each financial objective. The table below discloses the Fiscal 2018 program threshold, target and maximum targets that were approved in advance of the fiscal year as well as the actual outcomes that led to payouts that were above target.

[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives:    In September 2017, the Compensation Committee elected to use two long-term compensation vehicles for each of our NEOs for Fiscal 2018. All officers participate in long-term performance-vesting restricted stock unit awards and in time-vesting restricted stock unit awards; 40% of the target value of each executive's long-term incentive opportunity is performance-vesting restricted stock unit awards, and 60% of the target value of each executive's long-term incentive opportunity is time-vesting restricted stock units. The number of performance-based restricted stock units and time-vesting restricted stock awards was determined by dividing the target compensation amount by the value of one share of the Company's Common Stock. The value used in the calculation was the average of the high/low stock price on September 30, 2017. 
Time-vesting restricted stock unit awards vest on a pro-rata basis over a three-year period. Vesting of performance-based restricted stock unit awards awarded executive officers is dependent on (i) such officer's continued service for three years following the award and (ii) the Company achieving a specified performance objective over such three-year period. The Compensation Committee chose a three-year vesting period because it believes such a requirement is consistent with the practices of other companies in the markets in which Powell competes. The Compensation Committee chose net income as a performance measure for the performance-vesting awards because it believes that consistent delivery of net income over time is, for the Company, the most reliable indicator of the outcomes that drive the value of our stock. 
The actual number of performance shares earned will be determined according to the table below by multiplying the percentage earned by the number of performance-based restricted stock units initially awarded on October 1, 2017. The number of performance units earned when performance falls between threshold and target is determined by straight-line interpolation. The slope of the line established for performance between threshold and target is extended for results above target. The number of units that may be earned is capped, and amounts of net income in excess of 250% of target will not be considered in determining performance-based long-term incentive outcomes. 
Time-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted units awarded to NEOs on October 1, 2017, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Performance-Vesting Restricted Shares      Time-Vesting Restricted Units   
 Brett A. Cope      6,700        10,000

Severance and Employment Agreements 
Beginning in fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, the Company has entered into executive employment agreements with certain executives, including the NEOs. In order for the Company to recruit and retain the best possible executives, the Company seeks to negotiate employment agreements that provide for the mutual benefit of the Company, its stockholders and the executive. 
Our executive employment agreements exclusively govern the executive's rights upon termination of employment with the Company which include: A) Termination by the Company for Cause or Resignation by Executive without Good Reason (in each case, as defined in the employee's employment agreement); B) Retirement, Disability or Death; C) Termination by the Company for Poor Performance; D) Termination by the Company without Cause and not for Poor Performance or Resignation by executive for Good Reason prior to a Change in Control; and E) Termination by the Company without Cause and not for Poor Performance or Resignation by executive for Good Reason during the Protected Period following a Change in Control.  Due to existing contractual relationships with Messrs. Madison and Honeycutt that were individually negotiated, the Company is obligated to provide for a gross-up of excise taxes that may apply to certain contractual payments made on account of a change in control. However, on December 2, 2013, the Compensation Committee adopted a policy that the Company will no longer enter into agreements that provide tax gross-ups to executives. 
Tax and Accounting Implications of Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee considers tax and accounting implications in the design of the Company's compensation programs. While the Compensation Committee intends most compensation paid by the Company to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code, it may exercise discretion to pay compensation that does not meet the requirements of Section 162(m) if it judges that doing so would better serve shareholder interests. The Company's long-term and short-term plans are designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) and other provisions of the Code and to meet the conditions necessary for tax deductibility.

 CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Company is providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of the Company's employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Cope, our Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Pay Ratio"). 
The CEO Pay Ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. For Powell's last completed fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Cope to the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year    Mr. Cope's Total Compensation ($)(1)      Median Employee Total Compensation ($)      Pay Ratio of CEO Compensation To Median Employee ($)   
 2018    $ 1,862,653      $ 55,385        33.6 : 1   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   The annual total compensation of Mr. Cope, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented on  page 32 in the Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected September 30, 2018, as the date upon which the Company identified the "median  employee," which is within the last three months of the Company's fiscal year end and enables us to make an identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that as of September 30, 2018, Powell's employee population consisted of approximately  1,984 individuals (full-time, part-time and our variable workforce) working at the Company and its subsidiaries. Of these individuals, 1,550 were located in the United States and 434 were located in the following countries:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Country    Number of Employees (#)   
 Bahrain      1   
 Canada      243   
 Singapore      3   
 United Arab Emirates      1   
 United Kingdom      186   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Given the limited scale of our operations in many of these foreign countries, we elected to exclude all of our  employees in the above listed countries, except for Canada and the United Kingdom, as permitted by the SEC rules, as these employees account for less than 5% of our total U.S. and non-U.S. employee.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Powell's employee population, after taking into consideration the adjustments permitted by SEC rules as  described above, consisted of approximately 1,979 individuals as of September 30, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We identified our median employee based on the total cash compensation paid during the 12-month period ending September 30, 2018 as reflected in our payroll records, which was consistently applied to  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     all of our employees included in the calculation. We annualized the compensation of all full-time employees hired during this period. Since we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to our  employees, such awards were excluded from our compensation measure. For purposes of determining the median employee, we considered for each of our employees (i) actual base salary (in the case of hourly workers, base wages including overtime  pay); (ii) cash bonuses paid during the year; and (iii) sales commissions, if applicable. For our employees located in Canada and the United Kingdom, we applied a Canadian and United Kingdom to U.S. dollar exchange rate as of September 30,  2018, to the compensation elements paid in Canadian or United Kingdom currency.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After identifying our median employee using the above compensation measure, we calculated the employee's  annual total compensation in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  
[END TABLE]
The CEO Pay Ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the CEO Pay Ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
All members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors, and none of them are present or past employees of the Company.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and   greater-than ten percent stockholders are required by the regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on the Company's review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5 reports were required for those persons, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers and directors and greater-than ten percent beneficial owners during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, were in complied with in a timely manner. 
OTHER MATTERS 
As of the date of this statement, the Board has no knowledge of any business which will be presented for consideration at the meeting other than the election of three directors of the Company, and to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of executives. Should any other matters be properly presented, it is intended that the enclosed proxy will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the persons voting the matter.
