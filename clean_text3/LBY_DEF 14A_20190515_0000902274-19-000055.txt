A MESSAGE FROM THE  LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR  
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 2018 marked Libbey's 200th anniversary. Celebrating such a historic milestone provides an opportunity to reflect on the past and look to the future. We value our shareholders, customers, and employees whose dedication and support during the past two centuries have helped us to become the world's leading global glass tableware manufacturer. In turning to the next 200 years, we are inspired to accelerate Libbey's evolution and deliver improved performance and value to our stakeholders. On March 25, 2019, Michael P. Bauer became Libbey's new Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Bill Foley, who retired from the CEO role effective March 24, 2019. As part of Libbey's succession planning process, which has been underway for some time, we undertook an extensive search and our Board believes that Mike is the ideal candidate to succeed Bill. Mike's considerable knowledge of manufacturing, marketing, supply chain and finance will complement our business and help us continue to drive profitable growth, operational excellence and organizational excellence. We are confident that Mike, working together with our strong management team, will build upon the momentum created under Bill's leadership.  Bill has overseen a critical period in Libbey's commercial transformation over the past several years, including the creation of our highly successful and expanding e-commerce platform, reinvigoration of a culture of product innovation that is driving new product choices for our customers and significant contributions to net sales, and technology investments that are critical to improving our operational performance. Bill has guided Libbey through a particularly challenging competitive environment, helping to maintain and grow our leading industry position. We sincerely appreciate his hard work and commitment. We are also grateful to continue to have his insights and contributions as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors.  The Board believes that the mix of institutional knowledge and fresh perspectives among our leadership team, combined with the significant progress made toward executing our strategic priorities, makes Libbey poised to deliver future growth and stability. We thank you for your continued support. Sincerely, John C. Orr Lead Independent Director

Proxy Statement Summary
PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY
[BEGIN TABLE]
Company Overview and Business Highlights 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, we continued to execute our Creating Momentum strategic priorities:
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROFITABLE GROWTH   OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE   ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE 
Improving marketing capabilities in new product development and innovation to drive profitable growth   Improving operating processes, systems and technology   Building winning teams that foster high performance and live our core values 
[END TABLE]
The value of our Creating Momentum strategy is evidenced by the following significant accomplishments in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New products, which we define as products introduced within the previous 36 months, contributed $54.1 million in net sales. 
• E-commerce sales were approximately 12.1% of total U.S. and Canada retail sales, representing an increase of 34.1% compared to 2017. 
• We expanded our U.S. foodservice business into the healthcare market with product launches in August and October. 
• We launched the Adulting™ Collection, the Master's Gauge™ flatware collection, as well as melamine, premium plastic and aluminum products for worry-free serving. 
• We achieved strong customer service levels globally, with 90% of orders being delivered on time and in full during the last six months of the year. 
• We began implementation of a new ERP system that we anticipate, when fully implemented, will help us achieve run rate benefits between $15 million and $20 million annually. 
• We developed and implemented a leadership training and assessment program to ensure leaders at every level of the organization are equipped to support achievement of the Company's goals. 
[END TABLE]
Our financial results in 2018 were affected by heightened competitive pressures, continued declines in U.S. foodservice traffic, and perceived economic uncertainty in many of the markets in which we operate. We achieved top-line revenue growth, but our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted cash earnings fell far short of our expectations.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 net sales of $797.9 million reflected an increase of 2.1% from prior year. 
• Net loss was $8.0 million in 2018, compared to a net loss of $93.4 million in 2017. Our results in 2017 were affected by a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $79.7 million associated with our Mexico reporting unit. 
• Our adjusted EBITDA (calculated as shown in Appendix A) for 2018 was $71.0 million, compared to $70.6 million in 2017. 
• We fell short of target with respect to the financial performance measures under our 2018 Senior Management Incentive Plan ("SMIP") and our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"). 
[END TABLE]
While we are focused on taking advantage of opportunities we see in our markets to drive long-term growth, we need to continue to improve both our operational and organizational excellence. Therefore, in 2019 we plan to focus on improving cash generation, improving our operating efficiency and execution, and aligning our teams around critical initiatives to drive growth and stability.
Management and Board Leadership
Effective March 24, 2019, William A. Foley retired from his role as Chief Executive Officer. The Board has appointed Mr. Foley to serve as Executive Chairman of Libbey's Board of Directors.  The Board will review Mr. Foley's role as Executive Chairman within the next year. John Orr continues to serve as Independent Lead Director. For more information regarding the Board's leadership structure, see page 17.

Base Salaries
After voluntarily agreeing to a 10% reduction in his base salary in 2017, Mr. Foley's annualized base salary returned in 2018 to $825,000, the same initial rate established at his time of hire in January 2016. Effective April 1, 2018, Mr. Burmeister and Ms. Kovach received modest base salary increases of 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Mr. Mossing did not receive a salary increase in 2018, as he was hired in December 2017. When we hired Ms. Zibbel in April 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an initial base salary of $310,002. Mr. Miñarro did not receive a salary increase, as his employment ended January 15, 2018.
Equity Awards
Under our 2018 LTIP, named executives were awarded RSUs with ratable, four-year vesting. In light of the decline in our stock price during 2017 and in order to responsibly manage share availability under our Omnibus Incentive Plans, the Committee elected to use a new method to determine the number of RSUs to be granted to each executive. This change in methodology resulted in each executive receiving RSUs with an economic value on the grant date 21% to 26% lower than the economic value on the grant date would have been had the Committee used the method employed in prior years. For more information regarding the method used to calculate the number of RSUs to be granted, see "What pay did Libbey's executives receive in 2018? - Equity Compensation."
2018 SMIP Results
The Committee assessed our performance under our 2018 SMIP in February 2019. Payouts under the 2018 SMIP were based 40% on company-wide adjusted cash earnings (calculated as shown in Appendix A), 15% on e-commerce revenue, 10% on revenue from new product development, and 35% on strategic objectives. While we scored at or above target with respect to the e-commerce revenue, new product revenue, and strategic objective components, our poor performance with respect to our adjusted cash earnings metric resulted in all of our named executives receiving below-target payouts ranging from 90.3% to 99.4% of target.
2016 LTIP Performance Cash Results
In February 2019, our Compensation Committee also reviewed our performance under the performance cash component of the 2016 LTIP, which covered the three-year performance cycle ended December 31, 2018. Payouts for all of the named executives were determined based on our return on invested capital (ROIC) for each of the 2016 and 2017 plan years and on adjusted EBITDA for the 2018 plan year. The scale used to determine the payout score for each of the three 1-year performance periods is reset for each performance period to correlate with targeted ROIC or adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for that year. The amount of the final payout was determined based on the average of the three discrete, single-year payout scores. Applying the payout scales described on pages 34 and 35, the Committee approved payouts equal to only 19.7% of the target opportunities for the named executives. ROIC and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as shown in Appendix A.

PROPOSAL NO. 3   
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIBBEY INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
Approval of the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. þ 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR this Proposal. 
[END TABLE]
We currently provide equity-based compensation under the terms of our Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2006 Plan"), which was approved by the shareholders at the 2010 Annual Meeting, and the Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Existing 2016 Plan"), which was approved by the shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting. As of March 20, 2019, only 161,810 and 184,093 shares remained available for grant under the 2006 Plan and Existing 2016 Plan, respectively, with 1,145,640 shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2006 Plan and 668,086 shares subject to outstanding awards under the Existing 2016 Plan. Because we have only 345,903 shares remaining available for grant, our Compensation Committee's ability to provide competitive, performance-based equity compensation that aligns our executives' interests with those of our shareholders is very limited.  
We are submitting the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Amended 2016 Plan") to our shareholders for approval in order to ensure that we have a sufficient number of shares available for issuance in the form of equity awards in the future to attract and retain employees and non-employee directors who are critical to improving the Company's performance, to further align their interests with those of our shareholders, and to closely link executive compensation with our performance. The primary change in the Amended 2016 Plan is to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan by 1,750,000 shares. In addition, the Amended 2016 Plan updates the plan for certain tax law changes and modifies certain other provisions as more fully described on page 63 under the heading "Modifications to Other Provisions."
Adoption of the Amended 2016 Plan is critical to our success. If the Amended 2016 Plan is not approved, we will not have enough shares to provide equity compensation to our key employees. We do not believe cash awards are a viable alternative to replace the value of equity awards. Compared to equity awards, cash awards do not align executives' interests as closely with those of shareholders. Furthermore, in light of the Company's financial leverage, the Company is focused on using free cash flow to reduce debt, limiting the Company's ability to use cash for retention awards and long-term incentive compensation. Without additional shares, we will be unable to provide market-competitive compensation packages, as a result of which we may be unable to retain and attract the talent we need.

Our Board of Directors, which currently has nine directors, is divided into three classes. The term of office for members of Class II of the Board of Directors will expire on the date of the Annual Meeting in 2019. In January 2019, Carlos Duno notified the Board that he would not stand for reelection. Upon Mr. Duno's retirement, effective immediately preceding the 2019 Annual Meeting, the size of Class II will be reduced from three directors to two directors.
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Ginger M. Jones and Eileen A. Mallesch to stand for election to Class II. 
Those persons who are elected to Class II as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting will hold office until their terms expire on the date of the 2022 Annual Meeting or until their successors are elected and qualified. The terms of office of the members of Class III and Class I of the Board of Directors will expire on the date of the Annual Meeting in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Information regarding Ms. Jones and Ms. Mallesch is under "Who are our Director Nominees?" on page 12.
Only Ms. Jones and Ms. Mallesch will be nominated for election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Each has consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected, and we expect each to be available to serve. If either of them becomes unavailable to serve before the Annual Meeting, the proxy will be voted for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board, or the number of directors may be reduced.
Shares represented by proxies will be voted for the election of these two nominees unless authority to vote for any or all of these nominees is withheld. A shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors may withhold authority to vote for any or all of the nominees.

2019 Proxy Statement   15
Corporate Governance
HOW DOES OUR BOARD DETERMINE WHICH DIRECTORS ARE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT?
Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines approved by the Board, the Board has made a determination as to each Board member's independence. In making this determination, the Board has considered the existence or absence of any transactions or relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and Libbey and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those reported under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions," below. The Board also examined the existence or absence of any transactions or relationships between directors or their affiliates and members of Libbey's senior management or their affiliates.
As provided in the Guidelines, the purpose of this review was to determine whether there is any relationship that is inconsistent with a determination that a director is independent of Libbey or its management. Specifically, the Guidelines preclude a determination of independence if the director does not meet the independence requirements in the NYSE American Company Guide, since our common stock currently is listed on the NYSE American exchange.
As a result of this review, the Board has affirmatively determined that Carlos V. Duno, Ginger M. Jones, Eileen A. Mallesch, Deborah G. Miller, Carol B. Moerdyk, Steve Nave and John C. Orr are independent of Libbey and its management under the standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Bauer and Mr. Foley are considered to be inside directors because of their employment as Libbey's CEO and Executive Chairman, respectively.
Compensation Committee Independence. In determining whether the members of our Compensation Committee are independent, within the meaning established by the NYSE American Company Guide, our Board takes into account all factors specifically relevant to a determination of whether any Compensation Committee member has a relationship to us that is material to his or her ability to be independent in connection with his or her duties as a Compensation Committee member. The factors considered include, but are not limited to, the source of compensation of the member and whether the member is affiliated with us or one of our subsidiaries or affiliates. After taking into account all of these factors, our Board has determined that all of the members of our Compensation Committee are independent within the meaning established by the NYSE American Company Guide.
HOW DOES OUR BOARD THINK ABOUT BOARD REFRESHMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING?
The Board has no arbitrary term limits. The Board intends to maintain a balance between directors who have longer terms of service and over time have developed greater insight into the Company's business, particularly as it has performed through multiple economic cycles, and directors who have more recently joined the Board. Directors are required to retire from the Board when they reach the age of 75, although a director elected before his or her 75th birthday may continue to serve until the annual shareholder meeting following the date on which he or she turns age 75. On the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board may waive this requirement as to any director if it deems the waiver to be in the best interests of the Company.
The Board and each of its standing committees conduct self-evaluations annually. The Board carefully considers the results of the self-evaluations and potential skill gaps among current Board membership when making decisions regarding the addition or replacement of Board members. For example, when searching for a potential new director in 2017, the Board specifically sought a candidate with e-commerce experience, as the Board recognized the lack of e-commerce experience among its then-current members and recognized the importance of e-commerce to the Company's Creating Momentum strategy. Mr. Nave, who has extensive e-commerce experience, ultimately was  nominated by the Board and elected to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting. 
HOW DO SHAREHOLDERS NOMINATE CANDIDATES FOR THE BOARD?
A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board may notify our Corporate Secretary or any member of the Nominating and Governance Committee in writing, including any supporting material the shareholder deems appropriate. Candidates nominated by shareholders will be given the same consideration as candidates nominated by other sources.

The Board's Role and Responsibilities 
[END TABLE]
WHAT ARE THE BOARD'S KEY RESPONSIBILITIES?
The Board's key responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing and providing policy guidance for the business, affairs and operations of the Company; 
• Selecting the CEO and electing the officers of the Company; 
• Monitoring overall corporate performance;  
• Overseeing and participating in the Company's strategic and business planning process;  
• Reviewing the annual business budget; and  
• Reviewing significant risks, issues and opportunities facing the Company and management's approach to addressing such risks, issues and opportunities. 
[END TABLE]
HOW DO SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOARD?
Shareholders and other parties interested in communicating directly with the non-management directors as a group may do so by writing to Non-Management Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, Libbey Inc., 300 Madison Avenue, P.O. Box 10060, Toledo, Ohio 43699-0060. The Nominating and Governance Committee has approved a process for handling letters that we receive and that are addressed to the non-management members of the Board. Under that process, the Corporate Secretary is responsible for reviewing all such correspondence and regularly forwarding to the non-management members of the Board a summary of all correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the Corporate Secretary's opinion, deals with the function of the Board or its committees or that the Corporate Secretary otherwise determines requires the Board's attention. Directors may, at any time, review a log of all correspondence that we receive and that is addressed to the non-management directors or other Board members and request copies of that correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are brought immediately to the attention of our internal auditors and Audit Committee and are handled according to procedures established by the Audit Committee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Structure 
[END TABLE]
HOW IS OUR BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURED?
Our Board currently has seven non-management directors and two management directors. After Mr. Duno's retirement from the Board on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders, our Board will have six non-management directors and two management directors.  All of the non-management directors have been determined to be independent. For more information with respect to how the Board determines which directors are considered to be independent, see "How does the Board determine which directors are considered independent?" above.
In addition to assessing its leadership structure periodically, the Board assesses its leadership structure when warranted by specific circumstances, such as the appointment of a new CEO. When appropriate, the Board changes its leadership structure to ensure effective, independent oversight of management and to facilitate its engagement in, and understanding of, our business. For example, when Mr. Foley was named CEO in January 2016, the Board believed that the most effective leadership structure at that time was for Mr. Foley, who had served as a director since 1994 and as Chairman since 2011, to serve as both Chairman and CEO. Combining the Chairman and CEO roles in Mr. Foley demonstrated to our employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders that we were under strong leadership, with a single person, who has extensive institutional and industry knowledge, setting the tone and having primary responsibility for managing our operations.
Recognizing the importance of independent Board leadership, the Board also created the role of Lead Independent Director and chose Mr. Orr to assume the role. Mr. Orr has been an independent director on the Board since 2008, serves as the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, and is a member of the Audit Committee.
The Board most recently gave significant consideration to our leadership structure in the context of Mr. Foley's retirement as CEO on March 24, 2019. With Mr. Bauer's appointment to succeed Mr. Foley as CEO, the Board again has separated the role of CEO and Chairman, with Mr. Foley being appointed to serve as Executive Chairman.  
Mr. Bauer is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day affairs of Libbey and directing the formulation and implementation of our strategic plans. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Foley is responsible for setting the agendas for and chairing Board meetings and meetings of shareholders, attending meetings of the Board's committees with the approval of the respective committee, and assisting management in representing Libbey to external groups as needed and as determined by the Board, such as in connection with international trade matters relevant to Libbey. 
2019 Proxy Statement   17
Corporate Governance
We believe that this leadership structure is currently the most appropriate for Libbey because it allows our CEO to focus primarily on our business strategy and operations while leveraging the experience of our Executive Chairman to direct the business of the Board. The Board will review Mr. Foley's role as Executive Chairman within the next year.
Mr. Orr, a director since 2008, has served as Lead Independent Director since 2016, when Mr. Foley was appointed Libbey's CEO.  Mr. Orr serves as the principal liaison between the independent, non-management directors, the Executive Chairman and the CEO, and is responsible for approving the agendas for Board meetings, presiding over executive sessions of the independent directors, coordinating feedback from directors in connection with the evaluations of the CEO and each director, and acting as chair of any Board meeting when the Executive Chairman is not present.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
A substantial majority of our directors is independent, as defined in the NYSE American Company Guide and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct, which we refer to as our Code of Ethics, generally prohibits related-party transactions involving directors.
Our Code of Ethics requires that all of Libbey's directors, officers and other employees avoid conflicts of interest. Related-party transactions of the nature and magnitude that must be disclosed under Item 404(b) of Regulation S-K would be considered transactions that could give rise to a conflict of interest, and therefore are covered by our Code of Ethics. Our Code of Ethics requires that conflicts of interest be reported to our Legal Department, and that our General Counsel's written concurrence is required to waive any conflict of interest. In addition, our Code of Ethics requires that waivers of our Code of Ethics with respect to executive officers or directors may be granted only by the Board of Directors and only if the noncompliance with our Code of Ethics is or would be immaterial or if the Board of Directors otherwise determines that extraordinary circumstances exist and that the waiver is in our shareholders' best interests.
DOES LIBBEY HAVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES?
Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that govern the Board of Directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (which applies to all of our employees, officers and directors), as well as the Charters for each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, are available on our website (www.libbey.com). They also are available in print, upon request, to any holder of our common stock. Requests should be directed to Corporate Secretary, Libbey Inc., 300 Madison Avenue, P.O. Box 10060, Toledo, Ohio 43699-0060.
ARE LIBBEY'S DIRECTORS REQUIRED TO ATTEND LIBBEY'S ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS?
Our directors are not required to attend our Annual Meeting of shareholders, but we typically hold a Board meeting at the same location and on the same day as the Annual Meeting. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our directors will attend the Annual Meeting on May 15, 2019. In 2018, all of the Board members other than Mr. Orr attended our Annual Meeting.

Non-Management Directors' Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Although the Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews director compensation market data to ensure that the compensation of Libbey's non-management directors remains competitive, Libbey's directors repeatedly have declined to increase the annual cash retainer payable to non-management directors since 2013 and have declined to increase the value of the equity award made to non-management directors since 2015. As a result, a market study of Libbey's non-management director compensation performed in late 2018 found that the compensation paid to Libbey's non-management directors was substantially below the median for the peer group used in developing our 2019 CEO and CFO pay program and below public companies of similar size, as set forth in the most recent National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) 2017-2018 director compensation report.  In order to ensure that Libbey's compensation for non-management directors remains sufficiently competitive to attract and retain directors with the skills and expertise needed to support Libbey's strategy, the Nominating and Governance Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, an increase in the annual cash retainer payable for Board service and an increase in the value of the annual equity award, as noted in the table below.

Pursuant to the Director Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), directors may elect to defer cash and/or equity compensation into any of 13 measurement funds. The Director DCP and the predecessor deferred compensation plans for which non-management directors were eligible are unfunded plans, and the Company does not guarantee an above-market return on amounts deferred under these plans. Amounts deferred under the Director DCP or a predecessor plan are, at the director's election, payable either in a lump sum or in installments over a period of time selected by the director. Amounts deferred under our first deferred compensation plan for outside directors are payable in a lump sum upon the earlier of the director's death or retirement from our Board.
We reimburse our non-management directors for their travel expenses incurred in attending Board or Board committee meetings and for fees and expenses incurred in attending director education seminars and conferences. The directors do not receive any other personal benefits.

(2) Represents the grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of awards of stock made to non-management directors on May 16, 2018. On that date, we awarded certain non-management directors stock having a grant date fair value of $6.70 per share. The awards were attributable to service during the preceding year. Pursuant to our stock ownership and retention guidelines for non-management directors, directors are required to hold the net after-tax shares issued for at least one year from the grant date. 
(3) We do not maintain a pension plan for our non-management directors. We do not guarantee any particular rate of return on any pay deferred pursuant to our deferred compensation plans. Dividends on pay deferred into the Libbey Inc. phantom stock or measurement fund under our deferred compensation plans for non-management directors accrue only if and to the extent payable to holders of our common stock. Pay deferred into interest-bearing accounts under our deferred compensation plans for non-management directors does not earn an above-market return, as the applicable interest rate is the yield on ten-year treasuries. Pay deferred into other measurement funds under our deferred compensation plans for non-management directors does not earn an above-market return, as that pay earns a return only if and to the extent that the net asset value of the measurement fund into which the pay is deemed invested actually increases.

For a summary of our key executive compensation practices, including practices we use to drive performance and practices we do not use because we do not believe they would serve our shareholders' long-term interests, see page 8 of the Proxy Statement Summary.
CORE COMPENSATION ELEMENTS
The Compensation Committee strives to provide an executive compensation program that aligns the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. In furtherance of that aim, 50% of our CEO's target pay opportunity is performance-based and 80% of our CEO's target pay opportunity is "at-risk."
The percentages above represent pay opportunity at target and do not include sign-on awards. "Incentive-Based Pay" includes an annual cash incentive award under our SMIP and long-term performance cash awards under our LTIP. "Time-Based Pay" includes RSUs granted under our LTIP. "NEOs" exclude Mr. Miñarro, whose employment ended January 15, 2018.

Executive Compensation
Pay for Performance Alignment
We strive to structure our executive compensation program to align pay with performance. The 2018 compensation of our named executives reflects the Company's performance in multiple respects:
[BEGIN TABLE]
NO CEO SALARY INCREASE   INCENTIVE PAYMENTS BELOW TARGET   REDUCED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE VALUE   DECLINE IN RSU VALUE 
Mr. Foley's annualized salary has never been above $825,000, the initial rate established at his time of hire in January 2016   LTIP payouts were only 19.7% of target; SMIP payouts were 90.3% to 99.4% of target(1)   To conserve shares, the Committee changed the method used to calculate the number of RSUs awarded in 2018, thereby reducing the economic value of RSUs awarded in 2018 by 21% to 26% compared to the previous method   RSUs granted in 2018 have declined in value since grant date 
[END TABLE]
(1) Does not include Mr. Miñarro, whose employment ended January 15, 2018.
BASE SALARY
After Mr. Foley, Mr. Burmeister, Ms. Kovach and Mr. Miñarro voluntarily decreased their base salaries in May of 2017 (a decrease of 10% for Mr. Foley and 5% for each of the other named executives), their base salaries returned to their pre-decrease rates as of January 1, 2018. Mr. Foley's annualized base salary in 2018 was $825,000, the same initial rate established at his time of hire in January 2016. Effective April 1, 2018, Mr. Burmeister and Ms. Kovach received modest base salary increases of 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively. Mr. Mossing did not receive a salary increase in 2018, as he was hired in December 2017. When we hired Ms. Zibbel in April 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an initial base salary of $310,002. Mr. Miñarro did not receive a salary increase, as his employment ended January 15, 2018.
ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE
The annual cash incentive plan adopted by the Committee in February 2018 provided the named executives with the opportunity to earn an award based 65% on financial metrics (40% adjusted cash earnings, 15% e-commerce revenue, 10% new product revenue) and 35% on achievement with respect to certain shared non-financial strategic objectives directly tied to our Creating Momentum strategic priorities. Adjusted cash earnings is calculated as shown in Appendix A. Strong performance with respect to the e-commerce revenue, new product revenue, and strategic objectives components, combined with poor performance with respect to the adjusted cash earnings metric, resulted in payouts of 90.3% to 99.4% to each of the named executives, excluding Mr. Miñarro. Our SMIP has paid out below target each of the last six years, evidencing the rigor of the targets set by the Committee. 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM
Under the long-term incentive plan approved by the Committee in February 2018 for the 2018-2020 performance cycle, 50% of each executive's overall LTIP target opportunity consists of a performance-based cash incentive. The performance cash opportunity under the 2018 LTIP (2018-2020 performance cycle) is based on the Company's adjusted EBITDA, calculated as shown in Appendix A. 
The performance cash opportunity under the 2016 LTIP (2016-2018 performance cycle) was based on the Company's ROIC in 2016 and 2017 and the Company's adjusted EBITDA in 2018. The Company's failure to achieve target with respect to these performance measures resulted in payouts under the performance cash component of our 2016 LTIP of only 19.7% of target. This equals the lowest LTIP performance cash score ever under the performance cash component of the Company's long-term incentive plans.
EQUITY AWARDS
Under our 2018 LTIP, named executives were awarded RSUs with ratable, four-year vesting. The RSUs were intended to have an economic value at the time of the award equal to 50% of the applicable executive's overall 2018 LTIP target opportunity. To responsibly manage the limited number of shares remaining available for issuance under our Omnibus Incentive Plans, the Committee elected to modify the method used to determine the number of RSUs to be granted to each executive. This change in methodology resulted in each executive receiving RSUs with an economic value on the grant date 21% to 26% lower than the economic value on the grant date would have been had the Committee used the method employed in prior years. For more information regarding the method used to calculate the number of RSUs to be granted, see "What pay did Libbey's executives receive in 2018? - Equity Compensation."  
Demonstrating that our executive's pay is aligned with other shareholders, the value of this equity compensation has been further impacted by our negative total shareholder return. The chart on the following page shows, with respect to the RSUs granted to our CEO and other named executives in 2018, the market value on the grant date and the market value on December 31, 2018.

Compensation Programs
2019 SMIP
In order to further simplify the plan design and focus the executives on key financial measures and Company-wide strategic objectives, each executive's annual incentive award opportunity under the 2019 SMIP will be based 85% on financial metrics (50% adjusted cash earnings, 20% OTIF and inventory reduction, and 15% new product revenue) and 15% on the shared non-financial strategic objective of ERP implementation.

Executive Compensation
2019 LTIP
The Committee elected to maintain the same plan design for the 2019 LTIP as for the 2018 LTIP, including using adjusted EBITDA as the financial metric for the performance cash component and awarding the equity component of the 2019 LTIP entirely in RSUs to conserve shares under its omnibus incentive plans and manage its burn rate in light of the decline in the Company's stock price. In order to responsibly manage the limited number of shares available under the existing Omnibus Incentive Plans, the Committee elected to use the average closing price over the fourth quarter of 2018 to calculate the number of RSUs.
2020 LTIP
If the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved by our shareholders, the Compensation Committee intends, beginning in 2020, to modify the mix of vehicles in our long-term incentive program to include performance shares. While this is the Compensation Committee's current intention, the Committee's ultimate decision as to the plan designs for future long-term incentive programs will depend on a variety of factors and circumstances as existing at the time each applicable program is adopted.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, develop and retain global business leaders who can drive financial and strategic objectives and are intended to foster a pay-for-performance culture and maximize long-term shareholder value.
Our Compensation Committee follows these guiding principles when designing our compensation programs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitiveness - Overall, the mix and levels of compensation should be reasonably comparable to appropriate peer companies so that the Company can continue to attract, retain and motivate high performing executives in an environment where companies are increasingly competing for high-caliber talent. Recognizing that Libbey's size, manufacturing asset intensity and multi-channel characteristics make identifying appropriate peer companies especially challenging, the general guideline is to target compensation at the median; however, individual positions may have target compensation mix and/or levels above or below the median depending on an evaluation of relevant factors, including experience, performance, time in position, and what is needed to attract the best talent for key positions, particularly when the Company recruits from much larger companies. 
• Pay for Performance - Major components of compensation should be tied to the Company's overall performance. Base salary and annual incentive compensation also should be tied to the performance of the individual executive and his or her specific business unit or function. 
• Values - While the Company's pay for performance philosophy should reward the achievement of financial and strategic objectives, the manner in which results are achieved is also important in assessing base salary adjustments and annual performance bonus payments. Therefore, while not always directly quantifiable, the manner in which the executive achieves results through collaboration and leadership - in keeping with the Company's set of core values, notably teamwork, performance, continuous improvement, respect, development, and customer focus - are key considerations in the individual performance review process. 
• Judgment - In assessing the executive's contributions to the Company's performance, the Committee looks to results-oriented performance measures, but also considers the long-term impact of an executive's decisions. The CEO and Committee use their judgment and experience to evaluate whether an executive's actions were aligned with the Company's values and cultural elements. 
• Accountability for Short- and Long-Term Performance - Annual and long-term incentives should reward an appropriate balance of short- and long-term financial and strategic business results, with an emphasis on managing the business for the long term. Such incentives should have a clear, direct and balanced link to the Company's financial and strategic objectives. 
• Alignment to Shareholders' Interests - Long-term incentives should align the interests of individual executives with the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders. 
• Simplicity - The Company strives to the extent practicable to make its compensation programs straightforward, simple to understand, and easy to administer and evaluate for competitiveness and appropriateness. 
• Reasonableness - Indirect executive compensation programs are designed to be reasonable and appropriate, with executive perquisites applied conservatively but judiciously. 
[END TABLE]
In applying these guiding principles, the Committee seeks to ensure that the Company's executive compensation programs attract, retain and motivate highly talented executives, support achieving the Company's financial and strategic objectives, and align with shareholder interests generally.

Executive Compensation
WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF LIBBEY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM?
Balanced Program with Significant Pay at Risk
The core elements of compensation for which our executives were eligible in 2018 were base salary, an annual cash incentive award under our SMIP, and long-term cash incentive and equity awards under our LTIP. For 2018, the pay opportunities of our named executives were designed to provide a balance of stable and competitive pay in the form of base salary, welfare and retirement benefits and perquisites; equity-based compensation (RSUs) that aligns our executives' interests with those of shareholders generally and also serves as a retention tool; and annual and long-term incentive awards that are designed to motivate our executives to execute our strategy, thereby driving our financial and operational performance. In devising and administering the executive compensation program, the Committee weighs objectives, including talent attraction and retention, alignment with shareholder interests, and closely tying pay with performance, recognizing that these objectives often compete with one another.

PLAN DESIGN
In designing our 2018 SMIP, the Committee sought a design that, compared to our 2017 SMIP, was less complex and more keenly focused on metrics essential to executing our Creating Momentum strategy, and that more closely aligned the efforts of the individual executives. The Committee felt it was important, however, to continue to directly incent the executives to focus their efforts on critical objectives supporting our Creating Momentum strategy, recognizing that the benefits of those objectives may not be reflected in improvements to the Company's financial performance until future years. The Committee also considered the need to maintain motivation among the management team and retain high-performing leaders after a period of significant turnover among the senior leadership team and several years of below-target payouts. For these reasons, the Committee maintained certain metrics and objectives but abandoned the individual strategic objectives and variable weighting aspects of the previous year's SMIP in favor of the following: 
Financial Metrics (65% of Target Opportunity)
Adjusted Cash Earnings (40% of Target Opportunity)
The target and payout scale for the Company adjusted cash earnings performance metric was:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Adjusted Cash Earnings             
Full-Year  Adjusted Cash Earnings   (dollars in thousands)  Percent of Targeted   Cash Earnings   Performance   Level   Payout   Percentage 
Full-Year  Adjusted Cash Earnings   (dollars in thousands)  Percent of Targeted   Cash Earnings   Performance   Level   Payout   Percentage 
  $103,557     110.0%   Maximum   200% 
  $94,143     100.0%   Target   100% 
  $75,314     80.0%   Threshold   50% 
< $75,314     < 80.0%   Below Threshold   0% 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation earnings to reflect certain reorganization charges. The adjustment to cash earnings had no effect on the payout percentage for the metric, as adjusted cash earnings remained below the threshold level required for any payout.
The Committee believed that it was appropriate to adjust cash earnings (calculated as set forth on attached Appendix A) by the following item that did not reflect our core operating performance and were not anticipated or budgeted. As a result, the Committee adjusted cash earnings (calculated as set forth on attached Appendix A) by the following item: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Item   Amount of Adjustment to Company-Wide Cash Earnings ($)
Item   Amount of Adjustment to Company-Wide Cash Earnings ($)
Costs Related to Strategic Initiative   2,341,000   
Total   2,341,000   
[END TABLE]
Success under the e-commerce revenue component of the 2018 SMIP is based on the total gross revenue from products sold through all e-commerce accounts. The target and payout scale for the e-commerce revenue performance metric was:
[BEGIN TABLE]
E-Commerce Revenue             
Full-Year E-Commerce Revenue   (represented as% increase vs. prior year)   Percent of Targeted   E-Commerce Revenue   Performance   Level   Payout   Percentage 
67%   125%   Maximum   200% 
33%   100%   Target   100% 
20%   90%   Threshold   50% 
< 20%   < 90%   Below Threshold   0% 
[END TABLE]
The Committee felt the e-commerce revenue target was sufficiently challenging because it represented a significant increase over the prior year's e-commerce revenue target and the e-commerce revenue actually achieved in the prior year.
The Company achieved a 34% increase in gross e-commerce revenue as compared to the prior year, resulting in a payout score of 100% based on the scale above.
New Product Revenue (10% of Target Opportunity)
The new product revenue performance measure under the 2018 SMIP consists of gross revenue from new products launched in the previous 36 months on a rolling basis. The Committee chose new product revenue as a performance measure to encourage progress toward the Company's long-term goal to have new products make up 8% to 9% of the Company's sales. The new product revenue metric in the 2018 SMIP is not comparable to the innovation and new product development metric included in the 2017 SMIP. When designing the 2018 SMIP, the Committee redefined the metric to encompass new products launched in the previous 36 months on a rolling basis. This form of measure acknowledges that, due to the length of the new product development cycle from initial innovation to market penetration, revenue benefits from new products take time to achieve.
The target and payout scale for the new product revenue performance metric was:
[BEGIN TABLE]
New Product Gross Revenue             
Full-Year New Product  Gross Revenue   (dollars in thousands)  Percent of Targeted   New Product  Gross Revenue  Performance   Level   Payout   Percentage

[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation
Strategic Objectives (35% of Target Opportunity)
The strategic objectives component of the 2018 SMIP consisted of three equally weighted strategic objectives that were shared by all executives. For each objective, the named executives were evaluated and scored as a group, such that all applicable named executives received the same rating for the objective. The targets were established by the Committee early in 2018 and the Company's performance with respect to the objectives was evaluated and scored by the Committee in February 2019.  
The tables below describe each of the strategic objectives, their link to our Creating Momentum strategy, the types of measures, targets, and the Company's performance with respect to the objective as determined by the Committee at its February 2019 meeting.

At its meeting in February 2019, the Committee reviewed the Company's performance with respect to the strategic objectives.

SMIP PAYOUTS
Based on the payout scores for each of the plan components and the weight assigned to each component, the total payout score under the 2018 SMIP, unadjusted for any individual performance, was 90.3% of target.

[END TABLE]
Under the 2017 SMIP, the Committee did not retain discretion to modify a participant's payout based on individual performance, as the 2017 SMIP design included an individual objectives component. Because the 2018 SMIP design did not include an individual objectives component, the Committee retained discretion to adjust a participant's individual payout (up or down) based on individual performance. As a result, an executive who demonstrated exceptional performance may be awarded a payout greater than the payout based strictly on the shared financial and strategic objectives. Alternatively, an executive whose individual performance did not meet expectations may be awarded a payout less than the payout that is based strictly on Company-wide performance measures. Applying the individual performance modifier also ensures that the executive's compensation is based not only on the goals achieved, but also on the extent to which the executive demonstrates effective organizational leadership skills in the execution of our strategy. 
The Committee received input from Mr. Foley regarding the other named executives' individual performance review scores, including an evaluation of the extent to which they achieved their individual objectives. After meeting in executive session with Exequity, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Committee determined that, based on their extraordinary efforts and leadership in connection with a strategic initiative that we terminated in the third quarter of 2018, the payouts for each of Mr. Foley, Mr. Burmeister and Ms. Kovach should be increased 10%.
Accordingly, the named executives received the following payouts under the SMIP:

Executive Compensation
The Committee believes cash is the appropriate vehicle for the performance component of the long-term incentive plans. While the Committee has considered the use of performance-based equity awards,  the Committee continues to use performance-based cash because of the need to conserve shares under its Omnibus Incentive Plans and manage the Company's burn rate in light of the decline in the Company's stock price. If the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved by our shareholders, the Compensation Committee intends, beginning in 2020, to modify the mix of vehicles in our long-term incentive program to include performance shares. While this is the Compensation Committee's current intention, the Committee's ultimate decision as to the plan designs for future long-term incentive programs will depend on a variety of factors and circumstances as existing at the time each applicable program is adopted.
The cash-based performance opportunity provided to our named executives for performance during 2018 consisted of the following components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A performance component under our 2016 LTIP (for the 2016-2018 performance cycle) that provides for cash awards if and to the extent we achieve our targeted adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) for each of 2016 and 2017 and our targeted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2018; a performance component under our 2017 LTIP (for the 2017-2019 performance cycle) that provides for cash awards if and to the extent we achieve our targeted adjusted ROIC for 2017 and our targeted adjusted EBITDA for each of 2017 and 2018; a performance component under our 2018 LTIP (for the 2018-2020 performance cycle) that provides for cash awards if and to the extent we achieve our targeted adjusted EBITDA for each of the three 1-year performance periods included in the three-year performance cycle. The scale used to determine the payout score for each of the three 1-year performance periods is reset for each performance period to correlate with targeted adjusted ROIC or targeted adjusted EBITDA, as applicable, for that year. The amount of the final payout, if any, will be determined based on the average of the three discrete, single-year payout scores. In deciding to set annual goals instead of three-year goals, the Committee considered the extreme difficulty in forecasting three years ahead in the volatile economic environment (as evidenced by our inability to achieve target performance under our annual incentive plans over the past five years) and the need to keep management engaged as the Company faces that challenging environment.   
◦ For any performance cycle of which 2016 is a part, our 2016 adjusted ROIC target was 10.8%. We achieved adjusted ROIC of 9.9% in 2016, resulting in a payout score for the 2016 calendar year of 59%, as determined according to the following scale: 
Basis Points Above or Below 2016 Targeted Adjusted ROIC   Payout Score 
+100   200% 
0   100% 
-150   25% 
Less than -150   0% 
◦ For any performance cycle of which 2017 is a part, our 2017 adjusted ROIC target was 9.2%. We achieved 2017 adjusted ROIC of 3.1%, resulting in a payout score for the 2017 calendar year of 0%, as determined according to the following scale: 
Basis Points Above or Below 2017 Targeted Adjusted ROIC   Payout Score 
+50   200% 
0   100% 
-100   50% 
Less than -100   0% 
◦ For any performance cycle of which 2018 is a part, our 2018 adjusted EBITDA target was $89.8 million. In setting the target, the Committee considered the Company's prior year performance and alignment with the Company's annual operating plan and long-term strategic initiatives. The volatile global economy, decline in restaurant traffic, shift in retail sales toward e-commerce, and competitive pricing environment of 2017 were expected to continue in 2018. The realities of the business environment led the Company to shift its priorities from aggressive growth toward improving marketing and new product development capabilities and innovation, improving customer relationships, and simplifying the business - all of which would support future, sustainable, profitable growth. The Committee believed that an adjusted EBITDA target of $89.8 million would prove sufficiently challenging to achieve. In February 2019, the Committee determined that we had achieved 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $72.5 million, resulting in a payout score for the 2018 calendar year of 0%, as determined according to the following scale: 
Percent of 2018 Targeted Adjusted EBITDA   Payout Score 
112.5%   200% 
0   100% 
87.5%   50% 
Less than 87.5%   0%

Adjusted ROIC and adjusted EBITDA are calculated as set forth on Appendix A.

Executive Compensation
When the Committee initially adopted the 2016 LTIP and 2017 LTIP, the Committee believed that using adjusted ROIC as a performance measure would align with the long-term interests of our shareholders because of adjusted ROIC's relationship to total shareholder return. In February 2018, the Committee elected to use adjusted EBITDA as the financial metric for the performance cash component of the 2018 LTIP and modified the performance cash components of the 2016 LTIP and 2017 LTIP to provide that the performance metric for the 2018 and 2019 plan years would be based on adjusted EBITDA as opposed to ROIC. The Committee transitioned from adjusted ROIC to adjusted EBITDA for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee recognized that the large investments needed in connection with our ERP implementation, our e-commerce platform and new product development, all of which are essential to our Creating Momentum strategic priorities, were unlikely to generate significant returns until future years;  
• Given the asset intensity of our business, as well as our relatively high degree of financial leverage, the Committee believes that adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of core operating performance; 
• The Committee felt it was imperative to re-focus management on the primary drivers of cash earnings;  
• Adjusted EBITDA is regularly used by the Company internally to measure profitability; and 
• We believe adjusted EBITDA is used by investors, analysts and other interested parties in comparing our performance across reporting periods and in comparing Libbey to other companies with different capital and legal structures. 
[END TABLE]
Despite transitioning from adjusted ROIC to adjusted EBITDA, the Company still failed to achieve threshold performance for the 2018 calendar year. 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed our performance for the three-year performance cycle ended December 31, 2018, and, based on the average of the three discrete payout scores for each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, determined that we had achieved an overall payout score of 19.7% of target under the 2016 LTIP.

The Committee elected to award the equity component of the 2018 LTIP entirely in RSUs to conserve shares under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plans and manage its burn rate in light of the decline in the Company's stock price. If the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved, the Compensation Committee intends, beginning in 2020, to modify the mix of vehicles in our long-term incentive program to include performance shares. While this is the Compensation Committee's current intention, the Committee's ultimate decision as to the plan designs for future long-term incentive programs will depend on a variety of factors and circumstances as existing at the time each applicable program is adopted. For more information regarding the proposed 
2019 Proxy Statement   35
Executive Compensation
Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, see "Equity Compensation Plan Information - Proposal No. 3" beginning on page 60.
Historically, the Committee determined the number of RSUs actually awarded by dividing the intended economic value (50% of the executive's target long-term incentive opportunity) by the "trailing 20-day average," the average closing price of our common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days ending on the grant date. However, to further conserve shares available for issuance under our Omnibus Incentive Plans, the Committee elected to calculate the number of RSUs to be granted under the 2018 LTIP by dividing the intended economic value by the greater of: (a) the trailing 20-day average; or (b) the average closing price of our common stock over the fourth quarter of 2017 (the "Q4 2017 average"). Ultimately, the Q4 2017 average of $7.75 was used because it was higher than the trailing 20-day average ($5.74 for the grant to Ms. Zibbel and $6.15 for the grants to the other named executives). This change in methodology resulted in each executive receiving RSUs with an economic value on the grant date 21% to 26% lower than the economic value on the grant date would have been if the Committee had used the trailing 20-day average method as in prior years. 
In choosing to modify the method used to calculate the number of RSUs to be issued, the Committee weighed the need to responsibly manage the shares available under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plans against the potential retention challenges that may be created by reducing the total compensation opportunities provided to executives as a result of the reduction in the economic value of the RSUs delivered. 
Sign-on Awards
In connection with her hire, Ms. Zibbel was awarded a $100,000 cash sign-on bonus and an award of 10,000 RSUs to induce her to join the Company and to replace the value of compensation being forfeited at her previous employer. If Ms. Zibbel resigns without Good Reason before April 5, 2019 (when she has been employed by Libbey for one year), she must repay the entire cash sign-on bonus within 30 days of her date of termination. "Good Reason" is defined on page 42. The sign-on RSUs awarded to Ms. Zibbel cliff vest on April 5, 2021, the third anniversary of Ms. Zibbel's date of hire.
HOW DOES LIBBEY DETERMINE THE FORMS AND AMOUNTS OF EXECUTIVE PAY?
Participants and Tools
The Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the design, development and implementation of our executive pay program. Each year, the Compensation Committee evaluates Libbey's executive compensation program to determine what, if any, changes are appropriate. In making these determinations, the Committee may consult with its independent compensation consultant, management and the Board, as described below; however, the Compensation Committee uses its own judgment in making final decisions regarding the compensation paid to our executives.
The Compensation Committee consults with its independent executive compensation consultant when determined to be appropriate by the Compensation Committee. In 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Exequity, LLP to serve as the Committee's independent compensation consultant. A representative of Exequity attended the majority of the meetings of the Compensation Committee in 2018, including the February 2018 and February 2019 meetings at which the Compensation Committee made decisions regarding our executive pay program for 2018 and also advised the Committee in connection with other pay decisions made during the year. All expenses that we incurred in 2018 for services provided by Exequity were attributable to services provided by Exequity to the Compensation Committee in connection with its executive pay decisions.
In compliance with the NYSE American Company Guide's disclosure requirements regarding compensation consultant independence, Exequity provided the Compensation Committee with a letter addressing each of six independence factors. Their responses affirm the independence of Exequity and the partners, consultants, and employees who service the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters.
Our CEO, our Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer and our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary attend meetings of, and provide information to, the Compensation Committee and its consultant to assist them in their pay determinations. In addition, management may request that the Compensation Committee convene a meeting, and management may communicate with the Compensation Committee's consultant to provide the consultant with information or understand the views of, or request input from, the consultant as to pay proposals being submitted by management to the Committee. However, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session, without any member of management present, to discuss and make its final executive pay determinations.
Our non-CEO executives play no direct role in determining their own pay, except to the extent they assess their own performance against their individual performance objectives as part of our performance appraisal process and to the extent that the Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer, the Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary provide information to the Compensation Committee with respect to pay programs affecting the entire executive leadership team.
The Compensation Committee sets the performance goals for our SMIP and LTIP based upon input from our CEO, including suggested individual performance objectives and metrics under the SMIP and the performance cash component of the LTIP. In setting our corporate performance objectives and measures, the Committee seeks input from its independent consultant. The Committee also seeks input from our Board in setting our CEO's individual performance objectives and metrics.

Executive Compensation
INTERNAL PAY EQUITY AND WEALTH ACCUMULATION
In determining awards for current and future performance periods, the Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity within the senior leadership team, but does not consider the impact of, or wealth accumulated as a result of, equity awards made during prior years, since those awards represent pay for services rendered during prior-year periods.
TALLY SHEETS
In connection with the preparation of our proxy statement each year, the Committee reviews "tally sheets" that summarize, for each executive officer, the compensation paid and equity grants awarded during the prior year, as well as the amounts that would have been payable to each executive officer if his or her employment had been terminated under a variety of scenarios as of December 31 of the prior year. The Committee uses these "tally sheets," which are prepared by management and provide substantially the same information as is provided in the tables in this proxy statement, primarily to ensure that our executives' estimated pay is consistent with the Committee's intent in adopting the program and for reviewing internal pay equity within the senior leadership team.
BENCHMARKING AND PEER GROUPS
The Compensation Committee engages its independent consultant to conduct a full benchmarking study of the Company's executive compensation and that of its peers approximately every other year. Because the Committee uses benchmarking studies as a reference point, and not the sole determinative factor, in setting executive compensation, the Committee does not conduct benchmarking on an annual basis. As disclosed in the proxy statement filed in connection with our 2018 Annual Meeting, Exequity conducted a full benchmarking study in the fall of 2016, and the Compensation Committee considered the results of the study, in combination with many other factors, in setting our executives' pay opportunities for 2017. Consistent with its biennial benchmarking practice, the Compensation Committee did not conduct a compensation benchmarking study in 2017 and did not rely on peer group benchmarking in setting 2018 compensation. The Committee conducted a full benchmarking study in the fall of 2018 for use as a point of reference when setting executive pay opportunities for 2019.
SAY-ON-PAY RESULTS AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our annual say-on-pay vote is one of our opportunities to receive feedback from shareholders regarding our executive compensation program. Following the 2018 Annual Meeting, at which our advisory say-on-pay proposal garnered the support of approximately 82% of the shares voted, we reached out to our top 25 shareholders (collectively representing over 61% of our then outstanding common stock) to solicit feedback regarding executive compensation and corporate governance. Our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Human Resources Officer spoke with six shareholders (collectively representing over 21% of our then outstanding common stock) who accepted our invitation to provide feedback.
In our conversations with shareholders, we generally heard support for the strategic initiatives on which we are focused and for the compensation measures tied to those initiatives and recognition of the need to retain key executives in order to execute the Company's strategy and improve the Company's performance. We also heard suggestions for changes to our executive compensation program, many of which varied significantly from shareholder to shareholder. Suggestions we heard included, but were not limited to, preference for use of performance shares instead of performance cash in the Company's long-term incentive program, suggestions regarding performance metrics, and consideration of stock option awards as powerful incentive tools to drive performance and increase the Company's stock price. 
Our Compensation Committee considered the vote result and the feedback we received as it evaluated the compensation opportunities to be provided to our executive officers in 2019 and beyond. The Compensation Committee's ability to implement several of the suggestions proposed by shareholders is largely dependent upon an increase in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans. As such, we are requesting shareholder approval of an amendment to our Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Information regarding the proposed amendment can be found under the heading "Equity Compensation Plan Information - Proposal No. 3" starting on page 60. 
Overview of Process for Setting 2018 Executive Pay
 INITIAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE FOR MS. ZIBBEL
Ms. Zibbel joined Libbey effective April 5, 2018. In connection with her hire, the Compensation Committee approved an initial base salary of $310,002, a target SMIP opportunity of 50%, and a target LTIP opportunity of 70%. In setting Ms. Zibbel's initial base salary and target short-term and long-term incentive opportunities, we considered Ms. Zibbel's highly sought after skill-set and experience, her compensation package at her previous employer, the significant responsibilities of the Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer position and its importance to achieving our Creating Momentum strategy, the relationship of her compensation to that of our other executive officers, the fact that Ms. Zibbel had never before been chief human resources officer of a public company, and the results of the benchmarking study completed in October 2016. The Committee also granted Ms. Zibbel a sign-on cash bonus of $100,000 and a grant of 10,000 RSUs to induce her to join the Company and to replace the value of compensation she was forfeiting at her previous employer. If Ms. Zibbel resigns without Good Reason before April 5, 2019 (the first anniversary of her date of hire), she must repay the entire cash sign-on bonus within 30 days of her date of termination. The sign-on RSUs cliff-vest on April 5, 2021.
2019 Proxy Statement   37
Executive Compensation
BASE SALARY ADJUSTMENTS
The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries at least annually. With respect to base salary increases that were implemented in April 2018, the Compensation Committee made its decisions after receiving input from Mr. Foley and Exequity. 
APPROVAL OF 2018 SMIP AND 2018 LTIP DESIGNS
The Compensation Committee approved the Company's 2018 SMIP and 2018 LTIP in the first quarter of 2018. 
EQUITY GRANTS UNDER OUR LTIP
The Compensation Committee typically makes awards of equity to our senior leadership team under our long-term incentive compensation program each February. The Compensation Committee authorized these awards at its February 2018 meeting, which occurred before we announced financial results for the 2017 fiscal year. The number of RSUs actually awarded was a function of the average closing price of our common stock over the fourth quarter of 2017. In each case, except for awards made to Ms. Zibbel, the grant date was the first business day after we released our fiscal 2017 financial results. For awards of RSUs made to Ms. Zibbel, the Committee authorized these awards in March 2018 and the grant date was the first business day after we released our financial results for the first quarter of 2018.
AWARDS UNDER OUR 2018 SMIP AND 2016 LTIP
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed and certified our 2018 performance and made the awards under our 2018 SMIP and the performance cash component of our 2016 LTIP (for the 2016-2018 performance cycle). Details regarding the decisions made and payouts awarded are described above under "What pay did Libbey's executives receive for 2018?"
WHAT ARE LIBBEY'S EQUITY GRANT PRACTICES?
As explained above, the Compensation Committee typically makes awards of RSUs in February to our executive leadership team under our LTIP. The Compensation Committee also occasionally makes "sign-on" awards of RSUs or NQSOs to newly hired executives and other key employees. Typically, the number of RSUs or NQSOs awarded is determined as described above under "What pay did Libbey's executives receive for 2018 - Equity Compensation". Occasionally, the sign-on awards include the award of a fixed number of RSUs or NQSOs intended to make the executive whole for equity awards that the executive forfeits when leaving his or her prior employment, or to induce the executive to join the Company.
The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the CEO to make limited grants of RSUs to senior managers and other employees who are not executive officers or direct reports to the CEO. The CEO's authority to make these grants in 2018 was subject to the following limitations and conditions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The maximum number of shares underlying RSUs that the CEO was authorized to award to all eligible individuals was 230,000;  
• The RSUs awarded could vest no more rapidly than ratably on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date;  
• The CEO was authorized to make awards only outside "quiet periods";  
• RSUs awarded to individuals whose home country is China were to be cash-settled RSUs; 
• The CEO was required to report at least quarterly to the Compensation Committee regarding the nature and scope of awards made pursuant to this authority; and  
• The agreements pursuant to which RSUs were granted must be substantially in the form approved by the Committee from time to time. 
[END TABLE]
POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATED TO LIBBEY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Potential Impact of Misconduct on Compensation
Our SMIP and long-term incentive plans are authorized under our Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan or our Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, each of which contains a "clawback" provision. The clawback provision of the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan obligates the recipient of a cash or equity award to reimburse us if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we are required, as a result of misconduct, to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws; and  
• the award recipient knowingly engaged, or was grossly negligent in engaging, in the misconduct, or knowingly failed, or was grossly negligent in failing, to prevent the misconduct or is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
[END TABLE]
The amount to be reimbursed is the amount of any payment in settlement of an award made under the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2006 Omnibus Plan and earned or accrued during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC of the financial document embodying the financial reporting requirement in question.
 38   Libbey Inc.
Executive Compensation
Awards under the Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan are subject to forfeiture and clawback under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended, and under any clawback policy that we may have in place at any time. 
Share Ownership / Retention Guidelines
We obligate our non-management directors and our executive officers to achieve or retain ownership of meaningful amounts of equity in Libbey. For more information, see "Stock Ownership/Retention Guidelines" on page 57.
Deductibility of Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code precludes the Company from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to our covered employees (which includes the CEO and our three other most highly compensated executive officers, other than the Chief Financial Officer, for years prior to 2018). Prior to 2018 (and including tax years that began prior to January 1, 2018), this limitation did not apply to performance-based compensation. While the Compensation Committee has generally attempted to maximize the tax deductibility of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that the primary purpose of our compensation program is to support the Company's business strategy and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Therefore, the Compensation Committee has maintained the flexibility to award compensation that may not be tax-deductible if doing so furthers the objectives of our executive compensation program.
Under the recent U.S. tax reform, the exception to Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation has been repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to certain transition and grandfathering rules. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer is now included as a covered employee. Despite these new limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee continues to believe that a significant portion of our named executive officers' compensation should be tied to the Company's performance. Therefore, it is not currently anticipated that the changes to Section 162(m) will significantly impact the design of our compensation program going forward.
Compensation Risk Assessment
On an annual basis, management conducts a risk assessment of our compensation policies, practices and plans to determine whether they encourage excessive risk-taking. In addition to reviewing this annual risk-assessment, the Compensation Committee also reviews and discusses, at least annually, the relationship between risk management policies and practices and compensation and evaluates compensation policies and practices that could mitigate any such risk. Examples of features of our compensation program that guard against excessive risk-taking include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An appropriate mix of fixed and variable, short-term and long-term, and cash and equity compensation;  
• Compensation Committee discretion regarding individual executive awards;  
• Oversight by non-participants in the plans;  
• Long-term compensation awards and vesting periods that encourage a focus on sustained, long-term results;  
• Executive incentive awards are subject to forfeiture and clawback;  
• Prohibition against hedging, pledging and engaging in transactions involving derivatives of our stock;  
• Stock ownership/retention requirements for our executives; and  
• "Double-trigger" vesting of equity awards and non-equity incentives after a change in control. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has determined that our compensation policies, practices and plans do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk-taking, and that the level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
Mr. Foley
Mr. Foley is employed at will. He is not covered by an employment agreement or change in control agreement, nor is he eligible to participate in our Executive Severance Compensation Policy, our Salary Plan, or our SERP.
In early 2016, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Foley that provides for, among other things, limited separation benefits under certain circumstances. As with all other named executives, the award agreements relating to grants of RSUs, NQSOs and performance cash opportunities also provide for separation benefits in certain circumstances. There are no conditions to Libbey's obligations to provide separation benefits to Mr. Foley.
Because Mr. Foley was retired at the time of his hire and intends to retire once again when his employment with Libbey ends (regardless of when or how it ends), the Compensation Committee chose to provide Mr. Foley with more modest separation benefits compared to those of our other named executives.
2019 Proxy Statement   39
Executive Compensation
With respect to Mr. Foley, the following table summarizes the trigger events under which payments may be made and/or other benefits provided, and the material payments or benefits to be provided, assuming Mr. Foley's employment ended December 31, 2018. Effective March 24, 2019, Mr. Foley retired from his role as CEO but continues to be employed by the Company as Executive Chairman. If Mr. Foley's employment ends in the future, he will be eligible for the same benefits and payments as described below, except that his participation in the 2019 SMIP and the performance cash components of the 2017 LTIP (2017-2019 performance cycle), 2018 LTIP (2018-2020 performance cycle) and 2019 LTIP (2019-2021 performance cycle) will be prorated to March 31, 2019.

[END TABLE]
All Other Named Executives
We do not have employment agreements with our non-CEO named executives. Our non-CEO named executives are, however:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• parties to change in control agreements that provide for payments under the circumstances described below in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a Change in Control; and  
• covered by our Executive Severance Compensation Policy, which provides for certain separation benefits in the event of termination of employment without Cause absent a Change in Control. 
[END TABLE]
From the time of their hire through the end of 2018, Mr. Mossing and Ms. Zibbel were eligible for more limited severance benefits than those provided under our Executive Severance Compensation Policy. However, Mr. Mossing and Ms. Zibbel have since become eligible for full benefits under the Executive Severance Compensation Policy. In addition, the sign-on bonus provided to Ms. Zibbel is subject to full repayment if she resigns without Good Reason before April 5, 2019, and the sign-on bonus provided to Mr. Mossing in 2017 is subject to full repayment if he voluntarily resigns before December 4, 2019.
The terms of award agreements under which awards of RSUs and NQSOs were made provide for acceleration of unvested awards in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances. Additionally, the terms of award agreements relating to the performance cash components of our 2016 LTIP (for the 2016-2018 performance cycle), 2017 LTIP (for the 2017-2019 performance cycle) and 2018 LTIP (for the 2018-2020 performance cycle) provide for payouts in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances.
 40   Libbey Inc.
Executive Compensation
Mr. Miñarro's employment ended January 15, 2018. His termination was without Cause under the Executive Severance Compensation Policy, and he received severance benefits and payments pursuant to the terms of the Executive Severance Compensation Policy and equity and performance cash agreements. Such severance benefits and payments are consistent with those described below under "Termination without Cause," with the following exception: The Committee elected to accelerate the vesting of 3,000 unvested RSUs that were awarded to Mr. Miñarro in 2015 to replace the value of certain pension and social security benefits that Mr. Miñarro forfeited when he was promoted to Vice President, General Manager, U.S. and Canada, from his previous position with Libbey's Mexican subsidiary. Had the Committee not exercised its discretion to accelerate vesting, the 3,000 RSUs would have been forfeited upon Mr. Miñarro's termination.
Because individuals hired after January 1, 2006, are ineligible for participation in the Salary Plan and SERP, Ms. Kovach is our only named executive who is eligible for benefits under the Salary Plan and SERP. As of December 31, 2018, Ms. Kovach was at least age 55 and had at least five years of service with Libbey. As a result, Ms. Kovach would have been eligible to receive a retirement benefit under our Salary Plan and SERP if she had retired on or before December 31, 2018. If Ms. Kovach or any of our other non-CEO named executives had retired on or before December 31, 2018, all unvested equity awards would have been forfeited.
With respect to all non-CEO named executives, the following table assumes a termination date of December 31, 2018, and summarizes the trigger events under which payments may be made and/or other benefits provided, the material payments or benefits to be provided, and the conditions to our obligations to make the payments and/or provide the benefits.

Executive Compensation
DEFINITIONS
Unless otherwise specified above, the following definitions apply:
"Accrued Benefits" includes base salary through date of termination, any amounts to which the executive is entitled under any retirement savings plan, equity participation plan, medical benefit plan or employment policy and any incentive compensation earned but not yet paid for a performance period ended before the date of termination.
"Cause" means (a) willful and continuous failure to substantially perform duties; (b) willful and continuous failure to substantially follow and comply with directives of the Board; (c) commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty that results in harm to us or failure to comply with a material policy, including our Code of Business Ethics and Conduct; (d) material breach of a material obligation to us; or (e) commission of illegal conduct or gross misconduct that causes harm to us. When used in reference to a termination that is not in connection with a change in control, "Cause" can have any of the previously listed meanings or: conviction of a misdemeanor or felony that is directly related to, or indicates the executive is not suited for, the position the executive occupies with us.
"Change in Control" generally means any of the following events:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A person (other than Libbey, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under one of our employee benefit plans, or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by our shareholders in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of our common stock) becomes the "beneficial owner," directly or indirectly, of our securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding securities; 
• The consummation of a merger or consolidation pursuant to which we are merged or consolidated with any other corporation (or other entity), unless our voting securities outstanding immediately prior to the merger or consolidation continue to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 66 2/3% of the combined voting power of securities of the surviving entity outstanding immediately after the merger or consolidation; 
• A plan of complete liquidation or an agreement for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets is consummated; or 
• During any period of two consecutive years (not including any period prior to the execution of the agreement), Continuing Directors (as defined below) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of our Board. Continuing Directors means (i) individuals who were members of the Board at the beginning of the two-year period referred to above and (ii) any individuals elected to the Board, after the beginning of the two-year period referred to above, by a vote of at least 2/3 of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously approved in accordance with this provision. However, an individual who is elected to the Board after the beginning of the two-year period referred to above will not be considered to be a Continuing Director if the individual was designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with us to effect a transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a change in control. 
[END TABLE]
A person typically is considered to be the "beneficial owner" of securities if the person has or shares the voting power associated with those securities.
"Good Reason" means (a) the executive ceases to be an officer of the Company; (b) we reduce the executive's base salary and we do not apply the reduction in the same or similar manner to similarly situated employees; (c) we materially reduce the executive's annual incentive compensation opportunity and the reduction is not applied in the same or similar manner to similarly situated employees; (d) we materially reduce or eliminate an executive benefit or an employee benefit, and we do not apply the reduction to similarly situated employees in the same or similar manner; (e) we materially breach any written agreement between the executive and the Company and we fail to remedy the breach within 60 days after our receipt from the executive of written notice of breach; or (f) we exercise our right not to renew the agreement unless we concurrently exercise our right not to renew the agreements of similarly situated employees.

SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE
The following narrative and tables describe the "total compensation" our named executives earned during 2018, 2017 and 2016. The total compensation presented below does not reflect the actual pay received by, or the target pay of, the named executives in 2018, 2017 or 2016. The actual value realized by our named executives in 2018 from NQSOs and RSUs is presented in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table on page 48. Target annual and long-term incentive awards for 2018 are presented in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 45.
The core components of our named executives' compensation are base salary, an annual cash incentive opportunity under our SMIP, and a long-term incentive opportunity under our LTIP, which includes performance-based cash compensation and equity awards. In addition to these core components, our executives occasionally receive compensation through sign-on awards, discretionary awards in recognition of outstanding individual contributions, retention awards, or in connection with termination of employment.
Mr. Miñarro
In 2018, Mr. Miñarro received compensation in connection with his termination of employment. These payments and benefits were determined in accordance with the Executive Severance Compensation Policy and the award agreements governing awards of RSUs, NQSOs and LTIP performance cash opportunities. The values of those RSUs and NQSOs for which vesting accelerated in connection with Mr. Miñarro's termination are not included in the "All Other Compensation" column in this Summary Compensation Table because the cumulative grant date fair values were included in the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns of the Summary Compensation Tables in the years in which they were granted and the incremental fair value of the 3,000 RSUs for which the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to accelerate vesting is included in the "Stock Awards" column in 2018. For additional information regarding the payments and benefits provided to Mr. Miñarro in connection with his termination of employment, see "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" above and the Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment Table on page 51. 
Ms. Zibbel
In connection with her hire, Ms. Zibbel received a $100,000 cash sign-on bonus and 10,000 RSUs to induce her to join the Company and to replace the value of compensation being forfeited at her previous employer. If Ms. Zibbel resigns without Good Reason before April 5, 2019, she must repay the entire sign-on bonus within 30 days of her date of termination. "Good Reason" is defined on page 42.  The sign-on RSUs cliff-vest on April 5, 2021, the third anniversary of Ms. Zibbel's start date.

Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) As to Mr. Burmeister for 2017 and Ms. Zibbel for 2018, represents a signing bonus.   
(2) Represents the grant date fair value, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, with respect to RSUs granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As to Mr. Foley in 2016, also represents the grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of awards of stock made to non-management directors on May 10, 2016. On that date, we awarded certain non-management directors stock having a grant date fair value of $80,007, or $17.58 per share. Although Mr. Foley ceased to be a non-management director when he was appointed CEO on January 12, 2016, this stock award was attributable to service as a non-management director during the 2015 fiscal year. As to RSU awards in 2018, 2017 and 2016, the awards vest ratably over a four-year period from the date of grant, with the following exceptions: RSUs granted to Mr. Burmeister in 2017 vest ratably over four years from the first day of employment; 14,000 RSUs granted to Ms. Zibbel vest ratably over four years from the first day of employment; and 10,000 RSUs granted to Ms. Zibbel cliff-vest on the third anniversary of her first day of employment. For Mr. Miñarro in 2018, also includes the incremental fair value of 3,000 RSUs for which the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to accelerate vesting in connection with his termination of employment. For more information, see Footnote 11, "Employee Stock Benefit Plans," to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. The actual values realized by the respective named executives depend on the number of RSUs that actually vest and the price of our common stock when the RSUs vest. 
(3) Represents the grant date fair value, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, with respect to NQSOs granted in  2017 and 2016, respectively. The awards vest ratably over a four-year period from the date of grant or, in Mr. Burmeister's case, from the first day of employment. When Mr. Miñarro's employment ended on January 15, 2018, vesting was accelerated with respect to all NQSOs that otherwise would have vested by January 15, 2019, and all other unvested NQSOs were forfeited. For more information, see Footnote 11, "Employee Stock Benefit Plans," to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. The actual values received by the respective named executives depend on the number of NQSOs that actually vest, the number of shares with respect to which NQSOs are exercised and the price of our common stock on the date on which the NQSOs are exercised.

(4) Represents amounts earned by the named executives in 2018, 2017 and 2016 under our SMIP and under the performance cash component of our 2016 LTIP, 2015 LTIP and 2014 LTIP, respectively. The awards under our SMIP were paid in March of 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the awards under the performance cash component of our 2016 LTIP, 2015 LTIP and 2014 LTIP were paid in March of 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
(5) Represents the actuarial increase in pension value under our Salary Plan and our SERP. In 2018, the net pension value under our Salary Plan and our SERP declined for all named executives who were participants under those plans; as a result, for 2018 the amount of the actuarial increase is $0. We do not guarantee any particular rate of return on deferred compensation under our Executive Savings Plan ("ESP") or our EDCP. The rate of return depends upon the performance of the fund in which the participant's ESP or EDCP account is deemed invested. Accordingly, the amounts included in this column do not include above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation. Ms. Kovach is the only named executive who is eligible to participate in the Salary Plan and SERP. 
(6) For 2018, includes: (i) annual company matching contributions to our 401(k) savings plan (a broad-based plan open to all U.S. salaried employees); (ii) for Mr. Miñarro, our expense associated with the compensation payable to him in connection with his termination of employment; and (iii) the following perquisites:

GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE
During 2018, the Compensation Committee granted to our named executives RSUs under our 2006 Omnibus Plan, 2016 Omnibus Plan and 2018 LTIP. RSU recipients are not entitled to dividends or voting rights with respect to the common shares underlying the RSUs unless and until they are earned or vested. Our executives were not granted any stock options in 2018. On February 4, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the payment of cash awards under our 2018 SMIP and our 2016 LTIP.
Mr. Miñarro did not receive any grants of plan-based awards due to his employment ending January 15, 2018. The Committee did, however, accelerate the vesting of 3,000 RSUs that were originally granted to Mr. Miñarro in 2015.

(1) For non-equity incentive plan awards, the Award Date and the Grant Date are the date on which the Compensation Committee approved the applicable incentive plan or, if later, the date on which the Committee approved the executive's participation in, and target opportunity under, the applicable incentive plan. For All Other Stock Awards, except with respect to Mr. Miñarro, the Award Date is the date on which the Compensation Committee took action, and the Grant Date is the date on which we determined the number of RSUs awarded. With respect to Mr. Miñarro, the Award Date is the date on which the Compensation Committee approved the accelerated vesting of the RSUs and the Grant Date is the date on which the RSUs vested. The number of RSUs awarded to the named executives under our 2018 LTIP was determined by dividing the target dollar value of the applicable component of equity to be awarded by the average closing price of Libbey common stock over the fourth quarter of 2017. We inform grant recipients of their awards after we determine the number of RSUs to be granted. For awards made in February 2018, we determined the number of RSUs to be granted on the first business day after we announced our results of operations for the 2017 fiscal year. For Ms. Zibbel's awards of RSUs, we determined the number on the first business day after we announced our results of operations for the first quarter of 2018, since her first day of employment occurred during a quiet period.

Executive Compensation
Under the 2018 SMIP, each named executive has an opportunity to earn a payout based 40% on company-wide adjusted cash earnings, 15% on e-commerce revenue, 10% on new product revenue and 35% on strategic objectives. The Compensation Committee has discretion to increase or decrease an executive's individual payout under the 2018 SMIP based on the executive's exceptional or unsatisfactory individual performance. The amount disclosed under the "Threshold" column represents 5% of target performance and assumes achievement of a 50% payout with respect to the new product revenue component (the least heavily weighted component of the 2018 SMIP) and 0% with respect to all other components. For additional information regarding the adjusted cash earnings, e-commerce revenue, new product revenue, and strategic objectives metrics, including the methods of measure, weighting of components, and payout scales, see "What pay did Libbey's executive's receive for 2018?" starting on page 29. Adjusted cash earnings is calculated as shown in Appendix A.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b) Under the performance cash component of our 2018 LTIP, each named executive is eligible for a cash award in an amount up to 200% of the named executive's target award. Each named executive's target award under the performance cash component is 50% of the named executive's target award under all components of the relevant LTIP. The target awards are based on the named executives' respective annualized base salaries as of January 1, 2018 (in the case of Ms. Zibbel, April 5, 2018). The target awards for executives whose participation begins mid-cycle are prorated accordingly. Each named executive's target award under all components of the 2018 LTIP is set forth in the following table: 
    2018 Target Long-Term Award as a Percentage of Annualized Base Salary   2018 LTIP Performance Cash Target as a Percentage of Annualized Base Salary 
Named Executive     
W. Foley   300%   150% 
J. Burmeister   100%   50% 
S. Kovach   95%   48% 
W. Mossing   70%   35% 
S. Zibbel   70%   32% 
[END TABLE]
The extent to which a payout is earned under the performance cash component of the 2018 LTIP is based on our adjusted EBITDA for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as shown in Appendix A. The scale used to determine the payout score for each of the three 1-year performance periods is reset for each performance period to correlate with targeted adjusted EBITDA for that year. The amount of the final payout, if any, will be determined based on the average of the three discrete, single-year payout scores. The scale used to determine the payout score for the 2018 calendar year is:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Percent of 2018 Targeted Adjusted EBITDA   Payout Score 
112.5%   200% 
0   100% 
87.5%   50% 
Less than 87.5%   0% 
(3) Represents grants of RSUs made under our 2018 LTIP and an award of sign-on RSUs to Ms. Zibbel. The grants under our 2018 LTIP vest 25% per year beginning April 5, 2019, for Ms. Zibbel, and beginning on February 17, 2019, for all other executives. The 10,000 sign-on RSUs awarded to Ms. Zibbel cliff vest on April 5, 2021, the third anniversary of her date of hire. For Mr. Miñarro, represents 3,000 RSUs for which the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to accelerate vesting in connection with Mr. Miñarro's termination of employment. These RSUs were originally granted to Mr. Miñarro in 2015. 
(4) Except for Mr. Miñarro, represents the respective grant date fair values, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of the RSUs. For Mr. Miñarro, represents the incremental fair value of 3,000 RSUs for which the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to accelerate vesting in connection with Mr. Miñarro's termination of employment. These RSUs were originally granted to Mr. Miñarro in 2015.

(2) See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — How does Libbey determine the forms and amounts of executive pay? — Equity Grants Under Our LTIP" for information as to how we determine the number of NQSOs and RSUs awarded to our named executives. We inform grant recipients of their awards after we determine the number of NQSOs and/or RSUs to be granted. For awards made in February 2018, the grant date was the first business day after we announced our results of operations for the 2017 fiscal year. For awards made in May 2018, the grant date was the first business day after we announced our financial results for the first quarter of 2018. 
(3) Represents NQSOs awarded under our Omnibus Plans. NQSOs granted before 2015 vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. NQSOs granted to Mr. Burmeister in May 2017 vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of March 30, 2017, his first day of employment. NQSOs granted to Ms. Mossing vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of December 1, 2017, his first day of employment. All other NQSOs vest 25% per year for four years beginning on February 17th of the year after the grant. 
(4) Represents RSUs awarded under our Omnibus Plans. One share of our common stock underlies each RSU. RSUs granted in February 2016, March 2017, and February 2018 vest 25% per year for four years beginning on February 17th of the year after the grant. The 14,000 sign-on RSUs granted to Mr. Mossing on December 1, 2017 cliff vest on December 1, 2020, the third anniversary of his start date. The 10,000 sign-on RSUs granted to Ms. Zibbel on May 2, 2018 cliff vest on April 5, 2021, the third anniversary of her start date, while the remaining 14,000 RSUs granted to Ms. Zibbel in 2018 vest ratably over four years starting on April 5, 2019. All other RSUs vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. 
(5) Represents the market value, as of December 31, 2018, of unvested RSUs. We have estimated the market value by multiplying the number of shares of common stock underlying the RSUs by $3.88, the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of 2018.

PENSION BENEFITS IN FISCAL 2018 TABLE
Executives hired before January 1, 2006, are eligible for benefits under our Salary Plan and our SERP. Of our named executives, only Ms. Kovach is eligible for benefits under the Salary Plan and SERP. None of our other named executives is eligible for a pension benefit under our Salary Plan or SERP because each joined Libbey after December 31, 2005.
The Salary Plan is a qualified plan, and the SERP is an excess, non-qualified plan designed to provide substantially identical retirement benefits as the Salary Plan to the extent that the Salary Plan cannot provide those benefits due to limitations in the Internal Revenue Code. Benefits under the Salary Plan and SERP are determined by annual contribution credits equal to a percentage of annual earnings plus interest. Ms. Kovach is eligible for a pension benefit under the Salary Plan and SERP under the cash balance formula, which is based upon the value of a notional account that had an opening balance determined in accordance with the final average pay formula described below as of January 1, 1998. Under the cash balance formula, the account balance is increased each year with a contribution amount based on the sum of age and years of service with Libbey and with interest based upon the 30-year Treasury rate.
The final average pay formula is:
[BEGIN TABLE]
[(A) × (B) × (C)] + [(D) × (E) × (C)] + [(F) + (A) + (G)] 
[END TABLE]
Where:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(A) Monthly final average earnings for the three highest consecutive calendar years before 2008 
(B) 1.212% 
(C) Years of credited service up to 35 years 
(D) Monthly final average earnings above Social Security Wage base at retirement 
(E) 0.176% 
(F) 0.5% 
(G) Years of credited service over 35 years 
[END TABLE]
Only base salary and amounts earned under the SMIP are included in calculating final average earnings.
The retirement benefit may be adjusted if the employee has more or less than 35 years of credited service or retired before age 65. The Salary Plan and the SERP provide for additional benefit accruals beyond age 65 and for annual annuity benefits as well as an optional lump sum form of benefit. 
The following table sets forth information concerning the benefits provided to Ms. Kovach under the Salary Plan and the SERP as of December 31, 2018, the date that we use for pension plan measurement for financial statement reporting purposes.

Under the EDCP, our named executives and other members of senior management may defer base pay, cash incentive and bonus compensation and RSUs into an account that is deemed invested in one of 13 measurement funds, including a Libbey common stock measurement fund. RSUs in all events are deemed invested in the Libbey common stock measurement fund. We selected these funds to provide measurement options similar to the investment options provided under our 401(k) plan. Participants make deferral elections with respect to cash pay and RSUs before the year in which they are earned or they vest.
Participants can defer (a) up to 60% of the amount by which base salary exceeds required payroll obligations and 401(k) plan contributions; (b) up to 60% of the amount by which cash incentive or bonus compensation exceeds required payroll obligations; and (c) up to 100% of RSUs that are earned or vest during the year to which the deferral relates. We provide matching contributions on excess contributions of base salary in the same manner as we provide matching contributions under our 401(k) plan. The matching contributions are deemed invested in accordance with the participant's election as to his or her own contributions.
The balance credited to a participant's account, including the matching contributions that we make, is 100% vested at all times. However, the EDCP is not funded and, as a result, EDCP account balances are subject to the claims of our creditors.
We must pay the account balance in a lump sum on, or in installments beginning on, the distribution date elected by the participant. However, if a participant dies before his or her account balance is distributed in full, we must distribute the account balance in a lump sum to the participant's beneficiaries within 60 days after the participant's death. If a participant ceases to be a Libbey employee before his or her 62nd birthday, we must pay the participant his or her account balance in a lump sum within 60 days after his or her separation from service, unless the participant is a "specified employee" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. In that event, we must pay the participant his or her account balance on the first day of the seventh month after his or her separation from service. If a participant ceases to be a Libbey employee on or after his or her 62nd birthday, we must distribute the account balance either in a lump sum or in installments, as elected by the participant, on or beginning on the distribution date elected by the participant. In that event, the distribution date cannot be later than the January 1st immediately following the participant's 75th birthday. If, however, the executive is a "specified employee" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, we cannot distribute the account balance, or begin distributing the account balance, to the participant before the first day of the seventh month after the participant's separation from service. Finally, if a change in control, as defined in the EDCP, occurs, a participant's entire account balance will be distributed to him or her within 30 days after the change in control.
EDCP hardship distributions are permitted, but there are no loan provisions. All EDCP distributions are fully taxable. Rollovers to defer taxes are not permitted.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
As discussed under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control," we have a letter agreement with Mr. Foley and, for all non-CEO named executives, an Executive Severance Compensation Policy and change in control agreements pursuant to which they may be entitled to severance payments and/or other benefits upon termination of their employment, including in connection with a change in control of Libbey.
The terms of our RSU and NQSO award agreements provide for acceleration of unvested awards in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances. Additionally, the terms of award agreements relating to the performance cash components of our 2016 LTIP (for the 2016-2018 performance cycle), 2017 LTIP (for the 2017-2019 performance cycle) and 2018 LTIP (for the 2018-2020 performance cycle) provide for payouts in the event of termination of employment under certain circumstances.
Mr. Miñarro's employment ended effective January 15, 2018. His termination was without Cause under the Executive Severance Compensation Policy, and he received severance benefits and payments pursuant to the terms of the Executive Severance Compensation Policy and the agreements pursuant to which awards of RSUs, NQSOs and performance cash awards were made, with the following exception: The Committee elected to accelerate the vesting of 3,000 unvested RSUs that were awarded to Mr. Miñarro in 2015 to replace the value of certain pension and social security benefits that Mr. Miñarro forfeited when he was promoted to Vice President, General Manager, U.S. and Canada, from his previous position with Libbey's Mexican subsidiary. Had the Committee not exercised its discretion to accelerate vesting, the 3,000 RSUs would have been forfeited upon Mr. Miñarro's termination. The amounts reflected in the table on the following page are the amounts actually payable to Mr. Miñarro in connection with his termination of employment. 
With respect to all other named executives, the table provides information with respect to the amounts payable to each of them based upon the following significant assumptions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have assumed that the executive's employment terminated on December 31, 2018, under the various scenarios described in the table. 
• For purposes of illustrating the amounts payable on or in connection with a change in control, we have assumed that a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018, and that the named executive's employment terminated concurrently with the change in control. 
[END TABLE]
Ms. Kovach is the only named executive eligible for benefits under our Salary Plan and SERP. As of December 31, 2018, Ms. Kovach was at least age 55 and had at least five years of service with Libbey. As a result, Ms. Kovach would have been eligible to receive a retirement benefit under our Salary Plan and SERP if she had retired on or before December 31, 2018. If any of our non-CEO named executives had retired on or before December 31, 2018, all unvested equity awards would have been forfeited.

(2) As to those triggering events for which we estimated future payouts under the performance cash component of our 2017 LTIP and 2018 LTIP, we estimated the payout under the performance cash component of our 2017 LTIP assuming achievement at 33% of target performance, and we estimated the payout under the performance cash component of our 2018 LTIP assuming achievement of 67% of target performance. The amounts actually earned under the performance cash component of our 2017 LTIP and 2018 LTIP would be paid between January 1 and March 15 of the calendar year following the conclusion of the applicable performance cycle. 
(3) For those triggering events that result in acceleration of unvested equity awards: (a) except as to RSUs granted to Mr. Miñarro, we have estimated the value of common stock underlying RSUs by multiplying the applicable number of RSUs by $3.88, the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018; and (b) except as to RSUs granted to Mr. Miñarro, we have determined the in-the-money/intrinsic value of the applicable NQSOs by deducting the respective exercise prices for the NQSOs from $3.88 and multiplying the result (if greater than zero) by the applicable number of NQSOs. As to Mr. Miñarro, the values for the RSUs and NQSOs were calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on January 12, 2018, which was $7.71.

Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Foley, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
For 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company worldwide (other than our CEO), was $13,616; and 
• The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement, was $2,778,142. 
Based on this information for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Foley, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was: 204   : 1 
[END TABLE]
To calculate the ratio above, we used the same median employee that we had identified as of October 1, 2017. We believe there have been no changes in our employee population or our compensation arrangements in 2018 that would result in a material change in our pay ratio disclosure or our median employee. 
To determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The "median employee" is a full-time, hourly employee located in Mexico. For purposes of translating to U.S. dollars the compensation elements paid in Mexican pesos, we used a year-end average rate comprised of the average month-end rate for the 12 calendar months.  
• With respect to the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements of the employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. 
• With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. 
[END TABLE]
For additional information regarding the methodology, material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used to identify the "median employee," as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, see our proxy statement filed March 29, 2018.
The Securities and Exchange Commission rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

PROPOSAL NO. 3   
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIBBEY INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
Approval of the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. þ 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR this proposal. 
[END TABLE]
We currently provide equity-based compensation under the terms of our Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2006 Plan"), which was approved by the shareholders at the 2010 Annual Meeting, and the Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Existing 2016 Plan"), which was approved by the shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting. As of March 20, 2019, only 161,810 and 184,093 shares remained available for grant under the 2006 Plan and Existing 2016 Plan, respectively, with 1,145,640 shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2006 Plan and 668,086 shares subject to outstanding awards under the Existing 2016 Plan. Because we have only 345,903 shares remaining available for grant, our Compensation Committee's ability to provide competitive, performance-based equity compensation that aligns our executives' interests with those of our shareholders is very limited. 
We are submitting the Amended and Restated Libbey Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Amended 2016 Plan") to our shareholders for approval in order to ensure that we have a sufficient number of shares available for issuance in the form of equity awards in the future to attract and retain employees and non-employee directors who are critical to improving the Company's performance, to further align their interests with those of our shareholders, and to closely link executive compensation with our performance.  The primary change in the Amended 2016 Plan is to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan by 1,750,000 shares. In addition, the Amended 2016 Plan updates the plan for certain tax law changes and modifies certain other provisions as more fully described below under "Modifications to Other Provisions."
Adoption of the Amended 2016 Plan is critical to our success. If the Amended 2016 Plan is not approved, we will not have enough shares to provide equity compensation to our key employees. We do not believe cash awards are a viable alternative to replace the value of equity awards. Compared to equity awards, cash awards do not align executives' interests as closely with those of shareholders. Furthermore, in light of the Company's financial leverage, the Company is focused on using free cash flow to reduce debt, limiting the Company's ability to use cash for retention awards and long-term incentive compensation. Without additional shares, we will be unable to provide market-competitive compensation packages, as a result of which we may be unable to retain and attract the talent we need.
The Amended 2016 Plan will be effective as of the date on which our shareholders approve the Amended 2016 Plan. If the Amended 2016 Plan is not approved by our shareholders, the Amended 2016 Plan will not become effective, the Existing 2016 Plan and the 2006 Plan will continue in full force and effect, and we may continue to grant awards under the Existing 2016 Plan and 2006 Plan, subject to their terms, conditions and limitations, using the shares available for issuance thereunder. 
 60   Libbey Inc.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Increase in Number of Shares
The Amended 2016 Plan will increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by 1,750,000 shares from 1,200,000 shares to 2,950,000 shares. Under the current form of the Existing 2016 Plan, as of March 20, 2019, 184,093 shares remain available for grant. If the Amended 2016 Plan is approved, the maximum number of shares available for future issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan would be 1,934,093. The additional shares will be available for grant over multiple years. 
We believe this increase is reasonable and in the Company's best interests for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Additional shares are required for Libbey to make continued equity grants as necessary in order to attract and retain key talent. As of March 20, 2019, only 345,903 shares remained available for future grant under our 2006 Plan and Existing 2016 Plan combined, which is lower than our three-year average annual share utilization of 591,643 shares. Unless the proposed increase is approved, Libbey will be unable to make grants to existing high-value employees and executives, directors, and any new executive hires, which will make it difficult for us to retain and attract the talent required to successfully execute the Company's strategy and improve the Company's performance.   
2. Additional shares allow Libbey to structure compensation programs that more closely align pay with performance. In order to conserve shares under our incentive plans and manage our burn rate in light of the decline in the Company's stock price, the components of our 2018 and 2019 long-term incentive programs are RSUs and performance cash. With additional shares, the Compensation Committee would have the flexibility to include vehicles such as stock options and/or performance shares in our executive compensation program. If the Amended 2016 Plan is approved, the Compensation Committee intends, beginning in 2020, to modify the mix of vehicles in our long-term incentive program to include performance shares. While this is the Compensation Committee's current intention, the Committee's ultimate decision as to the plan designs for future long-term incentive programs will depend on a variety of factors and circumstances as existing at the time each applicable program is adopted. 
3. The ability to grant equity awards helps Libbey conserve cash. If the Amended 2016 Plan is not approved, we may have to reduce the equity component and increase the cash component of our compensation program, which would increase cash compensation expense and use cash that could be better utilized to reduce debt or reinvest in our business.  
4. Additional shares enable Libbey to act on feedback received from shareholders. During our recent shareholder outreach, several of the shareholders with which we spoke provided feedback regarding the use of equity compensation, including a preference that we use performance equity in addition to, or instead of, performance cash, and a suggestion that we consider granting awards of stock options to attract and motivate key talent. If the Amended 2016 Plan is not approved, we will not have sufficient shares to consider acting upon these or any other shareholder suggestions that require additional share availability.  
5. We carefully manage our equity incentive compensation. We recognize that equity compensation awards dilute shareholder equity, so we carefully manage our equity compensation. Although the additional 1,750,000 new shares to be available under the Amended 2016 Plan will increase the potential dilution to shareholders, the Board believes our equity compensation plans are well-managed and that our equity compensation practices are competitive and consistent with market practices. As of March 20, 2019, we had 22,273,568 authorized, issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. The following table sets forth, as of March 20, 2019, the number of shares authorized for future issuance under the 2006 Omnibus Plan and the Amended 2016 Plan, along with the equity dilution represented by the shares available for future awards as a percentage of the common shares outstanding on March 20, 2019: 
    Total Shares Available   Equity Dilution: Percent of Basic Common Shares Outstanding 
Remaining shares authorized for future awards under the  2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan  161,810     0.7% 
Remaining shares authorized for future awards under the  2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan  161,810     0.7% 
Remaining shares authorized for future awards under the 2016 Plan   184,093     0.8% 
Additional shares requested under Amended 2016 Plan   1,750,000     7.9%

6. The Amended 2016 Plan incorporates best practices. The Amended 2016 Plan reflects equity plan best practices including: 
• No repricing or buyouts: The Amended 2016 Plan prohibits repricing of stock options or SARs and prohibits buyouts of underwater stock options or SARs. 
• No discounted stock options or SARs: The Amended 2016 Plan prohibits discounted stock options or SARs except for those issued in substitution of outstanding awards in the context of mergers and acquisitions. 
• No reloads: The Amended 2016 Plan prohibits the automatic reload of stock options. 
• No liberal share counting: Under the Amended 2016 Plan, the following constitute delivered shares, will not be available for future Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan and will continue to be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining whether award limits have been reached: 
◦ shares that are withheld from an award or separately surrendered by the participant in payment of the exercise price or in payment of taxes relating to the award; and 
◦ shares that are not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding stock option or SAR. 
• Minimum 1-year vesting: Except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan, full-value awards that vest based on continued employment with or service to the Company may vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the awards are approved, and any full-value awards that vest based on attainment of performance goals must provide for a performance period of at least 12 months.  Awards of  
[END TABLE]
 62   Libbey Inc.
Equity Compensation Plan Information stock options and SARs that vest on the basis of continued employment may vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the awards are approved.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Double trigger change in control vesting: If replacement awards are granted to participants in connection with a change in control, vesting of the stock options and/or SARs that they replace and that vest based on continued service generally will not be accelerated solely as a result of the change in control.  Awards that are based on achievement of performance measures generally will be prorated as of the date of the change in control and deemed earned if and to the extent the performance goals actually are met as of that date unless the extent to which the performance goals actually are achieved as of that date cannot reasonably be determined by the Compensation Committee. In that case, the awards will be prorated and deemed earned at target. 
• Administered by an independent committee: Each member of the Compensation Committee is "independent," as defined under NYSE American exchange rules and each is an "outside director," as defined in 26 CFR §1.162-27. 
• No dividend equivalents on stock options or SARs: No dividend equivalents may be granted on awards of options or SARs. 
• Restrictions on payment of dividends and dividend equivalents: Dividend equivalents may be granted on awards of performance shares and performance units, but they will be held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional performance shares or performance units until the performance goals are achieved and will be paid only to the extent the underlying performance shares or performance units actually are earned. Dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any award that is subject to vesting conditions or restrictions will be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional shares until all vesting conditions or restrictions relating to the award (or portion of the award to which the dividend or dividend equivalent relates) have been satisfied and will be forfeited if and to the extent the vesting conditions or restrictions are not satisfied. 
• Awards subject to clawback / forfeiture: Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan are subject to forfeiture and clawback under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended, and under any clawback policy that we may have in place at any time. 
[END TABLE]
In light of the factors described above, our Board of Directors has determined that the size of the share reserve under the Amended 2016 Plan is reasonable and appropriate at this time. 
Modifications to Other Provisions
The Amended 2016 Plan makes certain changes to the Existing 2016 Plan intended to reflect compensation and governance best practices or to conform the plan to our current practices as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Existing 2016 Plan   Amended 2016 Plan 
Prohibits dividend Equivalents on stock options or SARs; provides that dividend Equivalents granted on performance units and/or performance shares will be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional performance Units and/or performance Shares until achievement of the underlying performance goals and will be paid only to the extent that the underlying performance units and/or performance shares are actually earned   Same as Existing 2016 Plan, but also provides that dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any award that is subject to vesting conditions or restrictions will be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional shares until all vesting conditions or restrictions relating to the award (or portion of the award to which the dividend or dividend equivalent relates) have been satisfied and will be forfeited if and to the extent the vesting conditions or restrictions are not satisfied 
Maximum number of shares that may be granted to non-employee directors collectively in any year is 150,000 shares   Increases maximum to 200,000 shares 
Except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the plan, full value awards that vest on the basis of the participant's continued employment with or service to the Company may not vest more rapidly than pro-rata over a three-year period, with the first vesting date occurring no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the award is approved   Except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the plan, full value awards that vest on the basis of the Participant's continued employment with or service to the Company may not vest before the first anniversary of the date on which the award is approved 
Contained provisions that were required for awards to qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.   The qualified performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We have removed certain provisions that were otherwise required for awards to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) prior to its repeal. Despite removing certain 162(m) provisions, the Amended 2016 Plan retains the same individual annual award limits that were in effect under the Existing 2016 Plan. These limits are described in further detail below under "Key Features of the Amended 2016 Plan - Individual Award Limits."

Summary of Principal Terms of the Amended 2016 Plan
The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended 2016 Plan itself, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B.
Administration.  The Amended 2016 Plan is generally administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board, or any subcommittee thereof, although the full Board of Directors may function as the Compensation Committee. The Committee is authorized to determine (a) the individuals, who we refer to as Participants, who will receive Awards, (b) when they will receive Awards, (c) the number of shares to be subject to each Award, (d) the price of the Awards granted, (e) payment terms, (f) payment method and (g) the expiration date applicable to each Award. The Committee is also authorized to accelerate the vesting of Awards and to adopt, amend and rescind rules relating to the administration of the Amended 2016 Plan. From time to time the Committee may delegate its authority to grant or amend awards to Libbey's officers, but the delegation must set forth the total number of Awards the officer may grant, and the officer must report periodically to the Committee regarding the nature and scope of the Awards granted. The Committee may not, however, delegate to senior executives of the Company who are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, authority to grant to, or to amend awards previously granted to, any individual who is subject to Section 162(m) of the Code.
Amendment and Termination.  The Committee may at any time amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Amended 2016 Plan or any Award made under the 2016 Omnibus Plan, but the Committee may not, without shareholder approval except as described below under "Adjustments," (a) reprice, replace or regrant, through cancellation and substitution of another Award, options or SARs, (b) lower the option price or grant price of an option or SAR or (c) exchange for cash underwater options or SARs. If shareholder approval for any amendment to the Amended 2016 Plan is required by law, regulation or stock exchange rule, then neither the Committee nor Libbey is authorized to amend the Amended 2016 Plan without shareholder approval. However, the Board of Directors may amend the Amended 2016 Plan or an Award to comply with law and administrative regulations.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
Eligibility.  Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan may be granted to our employees or employees of any of our present or future subsidiaries, and to any directors who are not our employees. More than one Award may be granted to an employee or to a non-employee director.  All employees and non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Amended 2016 Plan, although we generally limit awards to a group of approximately 75 employees and our non-employee directors.
Vesting.  Except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan, and subject to the Compensation Committee's administrative authority described above, any full-value Awards that vest on the basis of the Participant's continued employment with or service to the Company may vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which such Awards are approved, and any full-value Awards that vest upon the attainment of performance goals shall provide for a performance period of at least 12 months. Awards of SARs and/or stock options that vest on the basis of the Participant's continued employment with or service to the Company may vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which such Awards are approved.
Awards.  Each Award will be set forth in a separate agreement with the person receiving the Award and will indicate the type, terms and conditions of the Award. The following briefly describes the characteristics of each type of Award that may be made under the Amended 2016 Plan.
Stock Options.  Stock options granted under the Amended 2016 Plan may be either "non-qualified" or "incentive" stock options.  Non-qualified stock options are options not intended to receive the favorable tax treatment for participants applicable to incentive stock options under the Code.  At the time of grant, the Committee will establish the provisions of each stock option, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ the exercise price (which cannot be less than fair market value), 
◦ whether it is a non-qualified or incentive stock option, 
◦ the terms and conditions for exercise of the option; and 
◦ the duration of the option, although, except for nonqualified options granted to Participants who are not U.S. residents, no option will be exercisable more than 10 years after the date of grant. 
[END TABLE]
However, there are certain requirements under the Code that apply to incentive stock options, including  requirements that incentive stock options: (1) must have an exercise price per share of stock of not less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant; (2) may only be granted to employees; and (3) may not have a term longer than ten years after the date of grant.  In the case of an incentive stock option granted to an individual who owns, or is deemed to own, at least 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock underlying the subject options on the date of grant, and the incentive stock option must expire no later than the fifth anniversary of the date of its grant.
The exercise price for options, together with any applicable tax required to be withheld, must be paid in full at the time of exercise:
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ by cash or cash equivalents, 
◦ by shares previously owned by the participant valued at fair market value on the date of exercise, 
◦ by a broker-assisted cashless exercise procedure, 
◦ by a combination of any of the above methods, or 
◦ by any other method approved or accepted by the Committee. 
[END TABLE]
Stock Appreciation Rights.  SARs granted by the Committee will provide for payments to the holder based upon increases in the price of our common stock over a set base price.  Payment for SARs may be made in cash or shares or in a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.  A SAR may be granted either in conjunction with an option or independently.  At the time of grant, the Committee will establish the provisions of each SAR, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ the base price (which cannot be less than fair market value), 
◦ the terms and conditions for exercise of the SAR; and 
◦ the duration of the SAR, although, except for SARS granted to Participants who are not U.S. residents, no SAR will be exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant. 
[END TABLE]
Otherwise, the Amended 2016 Plan does not impose any restriction on the exercise of SARs or the amount of gain that can be realized.  However, the Committee may restrict the shares received upon exercise of a SAR.
Restricted Stock.  Restricted stock is the grant of shares that are nontransferable and may be subject to substantial risk of forfeiture until specific conditions are met.  During the period of restriction, Participants holding shares of restricted stock may have full voting and dividend rights with respect to the shares. The restrictions on the restricted stock will lapse based upon conditions determined by the Committee at the time of grant. The restrictions can be time- or performance-based, including based on the performance criteria described in "Performance Units/ Performance Shares" below.
RSUs.  RSUs give the Participant the right to receive shares at some designated time in the future, subject to the satisfaction of conditions determined by the Committee at the time of grant. The conditions can be time- or performance-based, including based on the performance criteria described in "Performance Units/ Performance Shares" below.
2019 Proxy Statement   65
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Performance Units/ Performance Shares.  Performance Units give the Participant the right to receive an amount designated as a "unit" at the end of a specified performance period, provided that specified performance goals are satisfied.  Performance Shares give the Participant the right to receive shares or cash based on the value of shares of our common stock at the end of a specified performance period, provided that specified performance goals are satisfied.  The performance periods and performance goals are determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
Other Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards.  From time to time, the Committee may grant Awards denominated in cash or other types of equity-based or equity-related awards that are not otherwise described above.  Awards may be designed to comply with or take advantage of applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the U.S. These other Awards will have such terms as the Committee determines at the time and may include payment upon meeting performance goals.
Non-employee Director Awards.  The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors may establish the amount and types of Awards that may be granted to our non-employee directors on a periodic and nondiscriminatory basis, as well as any additional amounts based upon:
[BEGIN TABLE]
◦ The number of committees of the Board on which a director serves, 
◦ Service as chair of a committee of the Board, 
◦ Service as Chair of the Board, and 
◦ First election or appointment to the Board. 
[END TABLE]
The terms of the Awards shall be set by the Nominating and Governance Committee, but cannot otherwise be inconsistent with the terms of the Amended 2016 Plan.
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  Dividend equivalents give the participant the right to receive dividends on stock subject to another type of Award, or, if the grant is independent of another Award, on a number of shares set by the Committee at the time of the grant of the dividend equivalent.  A dividend equivalent may be payable at the same time dividends are otherwise payable on the shares or at the time the shares subject to a corresponding Award are otherwise deliverable, if later.  No dividend equivalents may be granted with respect to Awards of Options or SARs. Dividend equivalents that are granted with respect to performance shares or performance units will be deemed placed in escrow or reinvested in performance shares or performance units until actually earned.  Dividend equivalents payable with respect to performance shares or performance units will be paid only to the extent the performance shares or performance units underlying them actually are earned. Dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to shares underlying any Award that is subject to vesting conditions or restrictions shall be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional shares until all vesting conditions or restrictions relating to the Award (or portion of the Award to which the dividend or dividend equivalent relates) have been satisfied and shall be forfeited if and to the extent the vesting conditions or restrictions are not satisfied. 
Share Counting.  Under the Amended 2016 Plan, awards that are to be paid in cash pursuant to their terms will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan. In addition, if an award is settled in cash, the number of shares of common stock on which the award is based will not count toward any limit on the number of shares that may be awarded to an individual, but will be counted against the annual award limit for cash-based awards.
To the extent an Award granted under the Amended 2016 Plan is canceled, expired, forfeited, surrendered, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of the shares, the shares of common stock retained by or returned to the Company will:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not be deemed to have been delivered under the Amended 2016 Plan; 
• be available for future Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan; and 
• increase the share reserve by one share for each share that is retained by or returned to the Company. 
[END TABLE]
However, the following will constitute delivered shares, will not be available for future Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan and will continue to be counted as outstanding for purposes of determining whether award limits have been reached:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shares that are withheld from an Award or separately surrendered by the participant in payment of the exercise or purchase price or in payment of taxes relating to the Award; and 
• shares that are not issued or delivered as a result of the net settlement of an outstanding stock option or SAR. 
[END TABLE]
Awards that are assumed or substituted for in a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock or reorganization will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan.
Change in Control.  All options and SARs will become fully vested and exercisable, and all other Awards that are not then vested but vest based solely upon continued service to or employment with Libbey, will become vested and payable in full upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Amended 2016 Plan), unless the Participant is provided with a replacement award that relates to a publicly traded security with a value and terms and conditions that are at least equal to the value of the Award being replaced.  In connection with any change in control, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may (1) provide for the cancellation or termination of any Award in exchange for a cash payment (or delivery of shares of stock, other securities or a combination of stock or other securities equivalent to the cash payment), or (2) provide that the time period in which a Participant may exercise options or SARs shall be extended, but not beyond the original expiration date.
Adjustments.  In the event of a corporate event or transaction, including merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, partial or complete liquidation, stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off or other distribution of stock or property, combination of shares, exchange of shares  or other similar change in capital structure, the Compensation 
 66   Libbey Inc.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
Committee may, in its discretion, adjust the number and kind of shares granted under the Amended 2016 Plan, the number and kind of shares subject to Awards, the exercise or grant price of outstanding stock options or SARs, the annual award limts, and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards.
Miscellaneous Provisions.  Generally, no Award granted under the Amended 2016 Plan may be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the Award has been exercised, or the shares underlying the Award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to the shares have lapsed.  The Committee may allow Awards other than incentive stock options to be transferred without value subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe.
We may deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit, in order to satisfy federal, state and local withholding taxes, domestic or foreign, the maximum amount that U.S. generally accepted accounting principles permit us to deduct or withhold while still qualifying the Awards for equity accounting.  A Participant may elect irrevocably to satisfy his or her withholding requirement by having us withhold shares otherwise deliverable under the Award. The number of shares to be withheld must have a fair market value equal to the tax required to be withheld.
The Committee may specify in the Award that a Participant will forfeit the Award, or any previously delivered shares, due to termination for cause or for violation of our material policies or any noncompete, confidentially or other restrictive covenants by which the Participant is bound. The issuance of shares pursuant to an Award will be subject to compliance with all laws, rules and regulations of any governmental agency or securities exchange.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The tax consequences of the Amended 2016 Plan under current U.S. federal law are summarized in the following discussion. This discussion is limited to the general tax principles applicable to the Amended 2016 Plan, and is intended for general information only. State and local income taxes, as well as foreign income taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The tax information summarized is not tax advice.
Nonqualified Stock Options.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an optionee generally will not recognize taxable income at the time a non-qualified stock option is granted under the Amended 2016 Plan. Upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the optionee will recognize ordinary income, and we generally will be entitled to a deduction. The amount of income recognized (and the amount deductible by Libbey) generally will be equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the aggregate exercise price paid for the shares, regardless of whether the exercise price is paid in cash or in shares or other property. An optionee's basis for the stock for purposes of determining his or her gain or loss upon a subsequent disposition of the shares generally will be the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise of the non-qualified stock option, and any subsequent gain or loss generally will be taxable as capital gain or loss.
Incentive Stock Options.  An optionee generally will not recognize taxable income either at the time an incentive stock option is granted or when it is exercised. However, the amount by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the exercise price will be an "item of tax preference" to the optionee for purposes of alternative minimum tax. Generally, upon the sale or other taxable disposition of the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option, the optionee will recognize taxable income. If shares acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option are held for the longer of two years from the date of grant or one year from the date of exercise, the gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of sale and the exercise price) upon disposition will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and we will not be entitled to any deduction. If this holding period is not met and the stock is sold for a gain, then the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise will be taxed as ordinary income, and any gain over that will be eligible for long- or short-term capital gain treatment. If the holding period is not met and the shares are disposed of for less than the fair market value on the date of exercise, then the amount of ordinary income is limited to the excess, if any, of the amount realized over the exercise price paid. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in the amount of any ordinary income recognized by the optionee.
Stock Appreciation Rights.  No taxable income is generally recognized upon the receipt of a SAR. Upon exercise of a SAR, the cash or the fair market value of the shares received generally will be taxable as ordinary income in the year of such exercise. Libbey generally will be entitled to a compensation deduction for the same amount that the recipient recognizes as ordinary income.
Restricted Stock.  A Participant to whom restricted stock is issued generally will not recognize taxable income upon the issuance of the restricted stock, and we generally will not then be entitled to a deduction, unless the Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code. However, when restrictions on shares of restricted stock lapse and the shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the Participant generally will recognize ordinary income, and we generally will be entitled to a deduction for an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the date the restrictions lapse over the purchase price of the shares. If the Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, then the Participant generally will recognize ordinary income at the date of issuance equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares at that date over the purchase price for the shares, and we will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount.
Restricted Stock Unit.  A Participant will generally not recognize taxable income upon the grant of an RSU. However, when the shares are delivered to the Participant, the value of the shares at that time will be taxable to the Participant as ordinary income. Generally, Libbey will be entitled to a deduction for an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the Participant.
Performance Unit/ Performance Shares.  A Participant who has been granted an Award of performance units or performance stock generally will not recognize taxable income at the time of grant, and Libbey will not be entitled to a deduction at that time. When an

Award is paid, whether in cash or shares, the Participant generally will recognize ordinary income, and Libbey will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.
Plan Benefits
The number of Awards that an employee may receive under the Amended 2016 Plan is in the discretion of the Committee and therefore generally cannot be determined in advance.  However, awards made to our non-management directors on the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders will be made from the Amended 2016 Plan. Accordingly, the following table sets forth awards to be made to our non-employee directors on May 15, 2019:

WHAT ARE LIBBEY'S PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES?
All audit-related, tax and other services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of these services by Deloitte & Touche LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its audit functions. The Audit Committee's policy regarding auditor independence requires pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit, audit-related and tax services on an annual basis. The policy requires that engagements that the auditors or management anticipates will exceed pre-established thresholds must be separately approved. The policy also provides that the Committee will authorize one of its members to pre-approve certain services. The Committee appointed Ginger Jones, Chair of the Committee, to pre-approve these services.
For our 2018 fiscal year, Deloitte & Touche LLP served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as our independent auditors for our 2019 fiscal year.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. The representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Report of the Audit Committee 
[END TABLE]
The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by Libbey under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent Libbey specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein.
The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of our financial statements on behalf of the Board of Directors; the adequacy of our systems of internal controls; our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the qualifications and independence of our independent auditors; and the performance of our independent auditors and of our internal audit function.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has direct responsibility for, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• confirming the independence of our independent auditors; 
• appointing, compensating and retaining our independent auditors; 
• reviewing the scope of the audit services to be provided by our independent auditors, including the adequacy of staffing and compensation; 
• approving non-audit services; 
• overseeing management's relationship with our independent auditors; 
• overseeing management's implementation and maintenance of effective systems of internal and disclosure controls; 
• reviewing our internal audit program; and 
• together with the Board and its other standing committees, overseeing our enterprise risk management program. 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and the independent auditors all annual and quarterly financial statements before their issuance. The Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent auditors include a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
With respect to the audited financial statements for the year-ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee met both with management and with the independent auditors who are responsible for auditing the financial statements prepared by management and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee also met with each of the independent auditors and the internal auditors without management being present. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors and management the results of the independent auditors' examinations; their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles; the adequacy and effectiveness of our accounting and financial internal controls; the reasonableness of significant judgments; the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements; and such other matters as are required to be communicated to the Audit Committee under Statement on Auditing Standards Standard No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The independent auditors provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors their independence.
Taking all of these reviews and discussions into account, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Abstentions will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. For purposes of determining whether the shareholders have approved a matter, abstentions are not treated as votes cast "for," "against" or "withheld," and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of any of Proposals 1 – 4. Additionally, broker non-votes will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to any of Proposals 1 – 3. The common stock outstanding on the record date held by the trustee under Libbey's 401(k) plans will be voted by the trustee in accordance with instructions from participants in those plans. Votes will not be cast with respect to those shares in the plans for which no instructions are received.
WHAT ARE BROKER NON-VOTES?
If you hold your shares in street name through a broker or other nominee, your broker or nominee may not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to certain matters, including Proposals 1 – 3, unless you give your broker or nominee specific instructions as to how to vote. Non-voted shares on non-routine matters are called broker non-votes. They will not be counted in determining the number of shares necessary for approval but will be counted in determining whether there is a quorum.
HOW WILL VOTING BE CONDUCTED ON OTHER MATTERS RAISED AT THE MEETING?
The proxy committee will vote on other matters that properly come before the meeting in accordance with the Board's recommendation or, if no recommendation is given, in the discretion of the proxy committee.
WHEN MUST SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS BE SUBMITTED FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING?
A shareholder desiring to submit a proposal for inclusion in our Proxy Statement for our  Annual Meeting must deliver the proposal so that we receive it no later than November 29, 2019. Any proposal submitted outside the processes of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act will be considered untimely if submitted after February 12, 2020.

Such solicitations may be made by personal interview, telephone or electronic communication. Arrangements have been made with brokerage firms and others for the forwarding of proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of common stock, and the Company will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.

Adjusted Cash Earnings at budgeted exchange rates (non-GAAP)   $ 68,561     
(1) We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a useful metric for evaluating our financial performance, as it is a measure that we use internally to assess our performance. For certain limitations and a reconciliation from net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see the "Non-GAAP Measures" and "Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA" sections included in Part II, Item 6. Selected Financial Data, in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
(2) Trade Working Capital, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net accounts receivable plus net inventories less accounts payable. We believe that Trade Working Capital is important supplemental information for investors in evaluating liquidity in that it provides insight into the availability of net current resources to fund our ongoing operations. Trade Working Capital is a measure used by management in internal evaluations of cash availability and operational performance. 
[END TABLE]
Trade Working Capital is used in conjunction with and in addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Trade Working Capital is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to any measure of liquidity and operational performance recorded under U.S. GAAP. Trade Working Capital may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as after tax adjusted income from operations (using a 35% tax rate) over ending Trade Working Capital (accounts receivable-net plus inventory-net, less accounts payable) plus net book value of property, plant and equipment. For purposes of the 2016 LTIP (2016-2018 performance period), the calculation of ROIC for the 2016 plan year is included in Appendix A of our proxy statement filed on April 4, 2017, and the calculation of ROIC for the 2017 plan year is included in Appendix A of our proxy statement filed on March 29, 2018.

From time to time, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall set the amount(s) and type(s) of Awards that shall be granted to all Non-employee Directors on a periodic basis pursuant to the Plan, as well as any additional amount(s), if any, to be awarded, also on a periodic basis, based on each of the following: (a) the number of committees of the Board on which a Non-employee Director serves, (b) service of a Non-employee Director as the chair of a committee of the Board, (c) service of a Non-employee Director as Chairman of the Board, or (d) the first selection or appointment of an individual to the Board as a Non-employee Director. Subject to the limits set forth in Section 4.1(c) and the foregoing, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall grant these Awards to Non-employee Directors and any Non-employee Chairman of the Board, and grant new Non-employee Director Awards, as it shall from time to time determine. The terms and conditions of any grant to any Non-employee Director shall be set forth in an Award Agreement.
Article 1413. Dividend Equivalents
Any Participant selected by the Committee may be granted Dividend Equivalents on Shares that are subject to any Award, to be credited as of dividend payment dates, during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award is exercised, vests or expires, as determined by the Committee.  However,: (a) no Dividend Equivalents may be granted on any Award of Options or SARs,; (b) dividends or Dividend Equivalents with respect to any shares underlying any Award that is subject to vesting conditions or restrictions shall be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional Shares until all vesting conditions or restrictions relating to the Award (or portion of the Award to which the dividend or Dividend Equivalent relates) have been satisfied and shall be forfeited if and to the extent the vesting conditions or restrictions are not satisfied; and (c) Dividend Equivalents that are granted on any Performance Units and/or Performance Shares shall be deferred and held in escrow or deemed reinvested in additional Performance Units and/or Performance Shares until the achievement of the applicable Performance Measures and the shares underlying such additional Performance Units and/or Performance Shares will be paid only to the extent the shares to which the Dividend Equivalents relate are actually earned. 
Article 1514. Beneficiary Designation
Each Participant under this Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under this Plan is to be paid in case of his death before he receives any or all of the benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and shall be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such beneficiary designation, benefits remaining unpaid or rights remaining unexercised at the Participant's death shall be paid to or exercised by the Participant's executor, administrator or legal representative. 
Article 1615. Rights of Participants
1615.1    Employment. Nothing in this Plan or an Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries to terminate any Participant's employment or service on the Board or to the Company at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue his employment or service as a Director for any specified period of time. 
Neither an Award nor any benefits arising under this Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries.  Accordingly, subject to Articles 3 and 1817, this Plan and the benefits under it may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Committee without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries. 
1615.2    Participation. No individual shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.
1615.3    Rights as a Shareholder. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a shareholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record holder of the Shares.
Article 1716. Change in Control
1716.1     Change of Control of the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the provisions of this Article 1716 shall apply in the event of a Change of Control.
Except to the extent that a Replacement Award is provided to the Participant to replace an outstanding Award upon a Change of Control: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) all then-outstanding Options and SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately; 
(b) all other Awards that are not then vested and as to which vesting depends upon only the satisfaction of a service obligation by a Participant to the Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate shall vest in full and be free of restrictions related to the vesting of the Awards; and 
(c) All then-outstanding Performance Units, Performance Shares, Other Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock Based Awards that vest upon the attainment of Performance Measuresgoals shall be prorated as of the date of the Change  
[END TABLE]

Appendix B
in Control and deemed earned if and to the extent the applicable Performance Measuresgoals actually are achieved as of the date of the Change in Control, provided that, if the extent to which the applicable Performance Measuresgoals actually are achieved as of the date of the Change in Control cannot reasonably be determined by the Committee, then such Awards shall be prorated as of the date of the Change in Control and deemed earned as if target performance had been achieved as of that date.
Except to the extent that a Replacement Award is provided to the Participant, the Committee may, in its sole discretion: (i)  determine that any or all outstanding Awards granted under the Plan, whether or not exercisable, will be canceled and terminated and that in connection with the cancellation and termination the holder of the Award may receive for each Share of Common Stock subject to the Awards a cash payment (or the delivery of shares of stock, other securities or a combination of cash, stock and securities equivalent to the cash payment) equal to the difference, if any, between the consideration received by shareholders of the Company in respect of a Share of Common Stock in connection with the transaction and the product of the purchase price, if any, per share under the Award and the number of Shares of Common Stock subject to the Award; provided, however, that if the product is zero or less, or to the extent that the Award is not then exercisable, the Awards will be canceled and terminated without payment therefor; or (ii) provide that the period to exercise Options or SARs granted under the Plan shall be extended (but not beyond the expiration of the Option or SAR). 
1716.2    Replacement Awards. An Award shall meet the conditions of this Section 1716.2 (and hence qualify as a Replacement Award) if: (i) it has a value at least equal to the value of the Replaced Award as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; (ii) it relates to publicly traded equity securities of the Company or its successor pursuant to the Change in Control or another entity that is affiliated with the Company or its successor following the Change in Control; and (iii) its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award (including the provisions that would apply in the event of a subsequent Change of Control). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination as to whether the conditions of this Section 1716.2 are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change of Control, in its sole discretion.
1716.3    Termination of Employment. Upon a Termination of Employment or, in the case of Directors, a termination of service as a Director, of a Participant occurring in connection with or during the period of two (2) years after the Change in Control, other than for Cause, (i) all Replacement Awards held by the Participant shall become fully vested and (if applicable) exercisable and free of restrictions, and (ii) all Options and SARs held by the Participant immediately before the termination of employment or termination of service as a Director that the Participant held as of the date of the Change in Control or that constitute Replacement Awards shall remain exercisable for not less than one (1) year following the termination or until the expiration of the stated term of the Option or SAR, whichever period is shorter; provided that, if the applicable Award Agreement provides for a longer period of exercisability, that provision shall control.
Article 1817. Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination
1817.1    Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination. Subject to Section 18.3, the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend or terminate this Plan and any Award Agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, that, without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders and except as provided in Section 4.4, Options or SARs issued under this Plan will not be repriced, replaced or regranted through cancellation and substitution of another Award, or by lowering the Option Price of a previously granted Option or the Grant Price of a previously granted SAR, or by exchange for cash, and no amendment of this Plan shall be made without shareholder approval if shareholder approval is required by law, regulation or stock exchange rule.
1817.2    Awards Previously Granted. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary (other than Section 1817.3), no termination, amendment, suspension or modification of this Plan or an Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under this Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding the Award.
1817.3    Amendment to Conform to Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Board of Directors may amend the Plan or an Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or an Award Agreement to any present or future law relating to plans of this or similar nature (including, but not limited to, Code Section 409A), and to the administrative regulations and rulings promulgated under the present or future law.
Article 1918. Withholding
1918.1    Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, in order to satisfy federal, state and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan, the maximum amount that U.S. generally accepted accounting principles permit the Company to deduct or withhold, while still qualifying the Awards for equity accounting.
1918.2    Share Withholding. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or SARs, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, or upon the achievement of performance goals related to Performance Shares, or any other taxable event arising as a result of an Award granted pursuant to this Plan, Participants may elect, subject to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the maximum tax rate that could be imposed on the transaction and that U.S. generally accepted accounting principles permit the Company to apply while still qualifying the applicable Awards for equity 
2019 Proxy Statement   B-14
Appendix B
accounting. All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing and signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
Article 2019. Successors
All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted pursuant to this Plan shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of the successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
Article 2120. General Provisions
2120.1    Forfeiture Events; Recoupment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. These events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of employment for cause, termination of the Participant's provision of services to the Company, Affiliate and/or Subsidiary, violation of material Company, Affiliate and/or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries.  
(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan or any Award agreement to the contrary, Awards will be subject, to the extent applicable, to: (i) the terms and conditions of the Company's recoupment policy (as previously adopted, and as may be amended and restated from time to time); and (b) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the "Dodd Frank Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and rules, regulations and binding, published guidance thereunder, and any similar legislation that may be enacted subsequent to the date hereof (including any rules, regulations and binding, published guidance thereunder).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, implement any recoupment policies or make any changes to the Company's existing recoupment policies as the Company deems necessary or advisable in order to company with applicable law or regulatory guidance (including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Act). 
[END TABLE]
2120.2    Legend. The certificates for Shares may include any legend that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer of the Shares.
2120.3    Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used in this Plan also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural.
2120.4    Severability. In the event any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.
2120.5    Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 
2120.6    Delivery of Title. The Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under this Plan prior to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and 
(b) Completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any applicable national or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. 
[END TABLE]
2120.7    Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction such authority as the Company's counsel deems to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares under this Plan, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell the Shares as to which requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
2120.8    Investment Representations. The Committee may require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to an Award under this Plan to represent and warrant in writing that the individual is acquiring the Shares for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute the Shares.
2120.9    Employees Based Outside of the United States. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries operate or in which Employees or Directors of the Company, its Affiliates and/or its Subsidiaries are located, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) Determine which Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall be covered by this Plan;

Appendix B
[BEGIN TABLE]
(c) Modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Employees and/or Directors outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws; 
(d) Establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent the actions may be necessary or advisable. Any sub-plans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures established under this Section 2120.9 by the Committee shall be attached to this Plan document as appendices; and 
(e) Take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approvals. 
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may not take any actions under this Section 2120.9, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate applicable law.
2120.10    Uncertificated Shares. To the extent that this Plan provides for issuance of certificates to reflect the transfer of Shares, the transfer of the Shares may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange.
2120.11    Unfunded Plan. Participants shall have no right, title or interest in or to any investments that the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under this Plan. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative or any other individual. To the extent that any individual acquires a right to receive payments from the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or its Affiliates under this Plan, the right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate, as the case may be. All payments to be made under this Plan shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate, as the case may be, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of the amounts except as expressly set forth in this Plan.
2120.12    No Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or whether fractional Shares or any rights to fractional Shares shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
2120.13    Retirement and Welfare Plans. Neither Awards made under this Plan nor Shares or cash paid pursuant to Awards may be included as "compensation" for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under the Company's or any Subsidiary's or Affiliate's retirement plans (both qualified and non-qualified) or welfare benefit plans unless the other plan expressly provides that the compensation shall be taken into account in computing a Participant's benefit. 
2120.14    Deferred Compensation. It is intended that any Award made under this Plan that results in the deferral of compensation (as defined under Code Section 409A) complies with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
2120.15    Nonexclusivity of this Plan. The adoption of this Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or Committee to adopt the other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any Participant.
2120.16    No Constraint on Corporate Action. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to: (i) limit, impair or otherwise affect the Company's or a Subsidiary's or an Affiliate's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or (ii) limit the right or power of the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate to take any action that the entity deems to be necessary or appropriate.
2120.17    Governing Law. The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, recipients of an Award under this Plan are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Delaware, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Plan or any related Award Agreement.
2120.18    Indemnification. Subject to requirements of Delaware law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a Committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Article 3, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company's approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his/her own behalf, unless the loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of his/her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute.
The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which the individuals may be entitled under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
2120.19    No Guarantee of Favorable Tax Treatment. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign law. The Company shall not be liable to any Participant for any tax the Participant might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise or payment of any Award under the Plan.
