In addition, we had a managed fleet of 61 aircraft as of December 31, 2018, compared to a managed fleet of 50 aircraft as of December 31, 2017.

As of February 21, 2019, all aircraft in our operating lease portfolio, except for one aircraft, were subject to lease agreements. 
New Order Pipeline.    During 2018, we increased our total commitments with Boeing and Airbus by a net 41 aircraft and added 45 option orders to acquire aircraft. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase 372 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for delivery through 2024, with an estimated aggregate commitment of $26.3 billion. We ended 2018 with $25.7 billion in committed minimum future rental payments and placed 72% of our order book on long-term leases for aircraft delivering through 2021.

Aircraft Sales.    During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold a total of 15 aircraft for proceeds of $407.8 million. In August 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell 18 aircraft to Thunderbolt Aircraft Lease Limited II ("Thunderbolt II"), an asset-backed securities platform which facilitates the sale and continued management of aircraft assets to investors. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the sales of 12 of these aircraft from our operating lease portfolio to Thunderbolt II. Our non-controlling interest in Thunderbolt II is 5.1%. All of the aircraft in Thunderbolt II's portfolio will be managed by us. As of December 31, 2018, we had six aircraft, with a carrying value of $241.6 million, which were classified as held for sale and included in Flight equipment subject to operating leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Financing.    In 2018, we issued a total of $3.03 billion in senior unsecured notes bearing interest at fixed rates ranging from 2.50% to 4.625% with one note bearing interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%, with maturities ranging from 2021 to 2028. In addition, we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility capacity to approximately $4.6 billion, representing a 21.7% increase from 2017 and extended the final maturity to May 5, 2022 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.05%. We ended 2018 with a strong liquidity position of $4.3 billion and total debt outstanding, net of discounts and issuance costs, of $11.5 billion, of which 86.4% was at a fixed rate and 96.5% of which was unsecured. As of December 31, 2018, our composite cost of funds was 3.46%.

Income before taxes increased 5.0% to $640.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $609.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our pre-tax profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 38.1%. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our net income was $510.8 million, or $4.60 per diluted share. 
Dividend Increase.    On November 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 30%, from $0.10 per share to $0.13 per share.

Executive Compensation Highlights 
Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate the highest caliber executives in the aircraft leasing industry by offering a comprehensive compensation program that is attractive enough to entice and retain successful senior executives. We also believe it is important that our compensation program attracts the highly talented executive who is experienced and capable of managing our aircraft fleet with a small team to help drive our profitability. 
At the end of 2018, we had total revenues of $1.7 billion and we had 97 employees, resulting in 2018 revenue per employee of approximately $17.3 million and total compensation expense representing 3.8% of revenues. We believe that the ratio of employees to total assets and total compensation as a percentage of revenues compares favorably to other companies in capital-intensive businesses. 
Compensation Governance 
Our compensation committee regularly reviews our compensation governance practices to ensure we are incentivizing hard work and high performance while also managing risk. Our executive compensation program currently includes the following features: 
What We Do: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Pay for Performance  
  ✓  Double-Trigger Change in Control Provisions  
  ✓  Provide moderate and reasonable severance benefits no greater than three times base salary and target  annual bonus  
  ✓  Manage the use of equity incentives conservatively with a net equity burn rate over the last year of less than 1%   
  ✓  Tally Sheets  
  ✓  Stock Ownership Guidelines (6x Base Salary for Chief Executive Officer)  
  ✓  Mitigate Undue Risk  
  ✓  Independent Compensation Consultant  
  ✓  Clawback Policy  
  ✓  Annual Say-on-Pay  
  ✓  Robust Stockholder Engagement Program   
[END TABLE]
What We Don't Do: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  x  Hedging and Pledging x  Tax Gross-Ups (except in connection with foreign assignments)   
  x  Dividend or Dividend Equivalents on Performance Awards x  Re-Price Stock Options x  Pension Benefits (other than 401(k))  
  x  Employment Agreements (except in connection with foreign assignments)   
[END TABLE]
Pay-for-Performance Philosophy 
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward our executives for contributing to the achievement of our annual and long-term objectives. We set robust goals to align performance-based compensation with the creation of long-term value for our stockholders. We also believe that our directors and employees' ownership of our stock is critical to alignment with our stockholders. Our 97 employees along with our independent directors collectively own approximately 9% of the Company's Class A Common Stock. 
vi  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
Engagement with Stockholders and Compensation Program and Disclosure Enhancements 
To better understand our investors' perspectives regarding our executive compensation program, for the last several years we have engaged in stockholder outreach. After issuing our proxy statement in March 2018, we engaged with holders of 49% of outstanding shares (none of whom were our employees or directors) to specifically discuss our compensation philosophy and program and to listen to their feedback. The compensation committee considered our stockholders' views when making decisions about changes to our 2018 and 2019 compensation programs. 
We continued to enhance our executive compensation program in response to evolving compensation practices and feedback from our stockholder engagement efforts, specifically by making the following responsive changes:

    ✓            Changed our Executive Chairmans 2018 Annual  Bonus.    In 2018, we changed the structure of our Executive Chairmans annual bonus so that in lieu of cash he was granted a stock bonus award in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) on  February 20, 2019, the date the dollar amount of his 2018 annual bonus was determined. These RSUs cliff vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The number of RSUs was equal to the dollar amount of his 2018 cash bonus divided by the  closing price of our common stock on the grant date. We believe denominating our Executive Chairmans annual bonus in stock instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairmans  compensation with stockholders long-term interests.   As a result of this change in  bonus structure, the only cash compensation that was paid to our Executive Chairman in 2018 was his base salary.

We believe denominating our Executive Chairmans annual bonus in stock instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairmans  compensation with stockholders long-term interests.   As a result of this change in  bonus structure, the only cash compensation that was paid to our Executive Chairman in 2018 was his base salary.   
    ✓              Streamlined  the Performance Metrics for our Annual Bonus.    In 2018, we reduced the number of operating performance metrics to two from four in 2017 by removing pre-tax operating margin and dollar  value of aircraft added to our fleet. We increased the component weighting to 40% each for the two 2018 performance metrics, Overall Revenue and Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Equity. We believe that focusing on  two key operating metrics simplifies the program to effectively drive profitable growth. 50% of the metrics focus on top-line performance and the remaining 50% focuses on profitability. These metrics also  provide greater transparency to stockholders because these performance metrics are reported in the Companys SEC filed financial statements.   By streamlining our annual bonus plan structure and using equally weighted top-line and  bottom-line performance metrics, we believe we have simplified our plan and further focused our executives on achieving profitable growth for our stockholders.

    ✓    Developed Custom Benchmark  Group.

Based on a 2019 study prepared by the compensation committees independent compensation consultant using 2017 data, the total direct compensation paid to our Chief Executive  Officer and our Executive Chairman approximated the median total direct compensation paid by the custom benchmark group members to their similarly situated executive officers, while the total direct compensation paid to our other NEOs was either  slightly above or slightly below the median total direct compensation paid by the custom benchmark group members to their similarly situated executive officers.   We believe the data from the Custom Benchmark Group is valuable to the compensation committee in determining the competitiveness of our compensation and any  compensation adjustments.

Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of eight members: Matthew J. Hart, Cheryl Gordon Krongard, Marshall O. Larsen, Robert A. Milton, John L. Plueger, Ian M. Saines, Ronald D. Sugar and Steven F. Udvar-Házy. Our directors serve for one-year terms until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal. Certain information regarding our directors is set forth below in Proposal 1: Election of Directors. 
Our Board held six meetings in 2018. Each of the directors standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting attended at least 90% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors on which he or she served in 2018. We expect but do not require our directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders each year. All of our directors who stood for election at the 2018 annual meeting attended that meeting. 
Director Independence 
Each director will qualify as "independent" pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") listing standards only if our Board of Directors affirmatively determines that he or she has no material relationship with us, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that six of our eight current directors, Mr. Hart, Ms. Krongard, Mr. Larsen, Mr. Milton, Mr. Saines and Dr. Sugar, were independent in accordance with the NYSE rules during the periods in 2018 and 2019 that they served as directors of our Board. Mr. Milton serves as our lead independent director. Messrs. Udvar-Házy and Plueger are not independent because they are employees of Air Lease Corporation (the "Company"). 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  1 
Board of Directors Leadership 
The Board of Directors currently has no firm policy as to whether the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer should be combined or separate. Instead, our Board of Directors believes that our leadership structure should be considered in the context of our Company's circumstances at any given time, including company culture, strategic objectives and any challenges we may be facing. Therefore, our Board of Directors evaluates its leadership structure annually to ensure that the most optimal structure is in place for our Company's needs – which may evolve over time. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in the event that the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not an independent director, the nominating and corporate governance committee may designate an independent director to serve as "Lead Director," who shall be approved by a majority of the independent directors. The Board of Directors believes having an independent Lead Director provides an appropriate balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate oversight by independent directors. 
As part of our Board of Directors' long-term succession plans for the Company, effective July 1, 2016, the Board established the separate executive position of Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Udvar-Házy, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer, now serves as the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and in addition to his executive officer role, chairs the meetings of the Board of Directors and works closely with Robert A. Milton, our independent Lead Director. John L. Plueger, our Chief Executive Officer, also works closely with Mr. Milton in his role. 
The role of the independent Lead Director helps ensure oversight by an active and involved independent Board of Directors, while Mr. Udvar-Házy's continued engagement as Executive Chairman of the Board enables the Company and the Board of Directors to benefit from his deep knowledge, industry relationships and operational experience. 
Mr. Milton has been elected annually by the independent directors of the Board of Directors to serve as independent Lead Director since our initial public offering in 2011. In this role, Mr. Milton has the following responsibilities as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and as requested by the Board of Directors:

Mr. Milton also serves on each committee of the Board. The Board of Directors believes that Mr. Milton's extensive aviation industry experience, chief executive officer experience, as well as other board experience make him well suited to serve as its independent Lead Director. 
The Board of Directors believes that the leadership structure with a strong independent Lead Director on the one hand, and knowledgeable and experienced Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors on the other, provides balance and is in the best interest of the Company. 
Executive Sessions of Non-Employee Directors 
As part of the Board of Directors' regularly scheduled meetings, the non-employee directors meet in executive session. Any non-employee director can request additional executive sessions. Mr. Milton, as lead independent director, schedules and chairs the executive sessions. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of these committees is composed solely of independent directors under the applicable NYSE rules. Our Board of Directors has adopted a charter for each committee that is available on our website at www.airleasecorp.com. 
All of the independent members of the Board of Directors are invited to attend all committee meetings and it is the practice of the independent directors to attend the meetings of committees upon which they do not serve. The independent directors believe that their attendance at these meetings enhances their understanding of the business and permits them to spend more time on issues at the meetings of the full Board of Directors. 
Audit Committee 
Our audit committee consists of Messrs. Hart, Milton and Saines. Mr. Hart is the Chairman of the audit committee. Our audit committee's duties include, but are not limited to, monitoring (1) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (2) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, (3) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm, (4) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and (5) our overall risk profile. Our audit committee is a separately designated standing audit committee as defined in Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
Our audit committee must at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are "financially literate" as defined under the NYSE listing standards. The audit committee also must have at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual's financial sophistication, and who qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our Board of Directors has determined that each member of our audit committee is financially literate and is an "audit committee financial expert." In addition to being "independent" under NYSE rules, each member of our audit committee also meets the enhanced independence requirements pursuant to Rule 10A-3(b)(i) of the Exchange Act, and the NYSE listing standards for purposes of serving on an audit committee. 
Our audit committee held four meetings in 2018. 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  3 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Messrs. Milton, Hart, and Larsen and Dr. Sugar. Mr. Milton is the Chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committee monitors the implementation of sound corporate governance principles, practices and risks and will, among other things: (1) identify individuals believed to be qualified to become a member of our Board of Directors and recommend to the Board candidates to be elected to fill vacancies and newly created directorships, (2) periodically review and recommend changes, as appropriate, to our corporate governance documents and (3) annually oversee the evaluation of our Board of Directors and its committees. Our nominating and corporate governance committee also reviews and approves all related party transactions in accordance with our policies with respect to such matters. 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee held four meetings in 2018. 
Compensation Committee 
Our compensation committee consists of Dr. Sugar, Ms. Krongard and Mr. Milton. Dr. Sugar is the Chairman of the compensation committee. Our compensation committee has overall responsibility for (1) overseeing our overall compensation structure, policies and programs, (2) reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, reviewing the performance of each such individual in light of those goals and objectives and recommending to the independent directors of the Board the compensation level for each such individual based on this evaluation, (3) overseeing the evaluation of management and succession planning for executive officer positions, (4) at least annually reviewing the compensation (both cash and equity based award compensation) of non-employee directors for service on the Board and its committees and recommending any changes to the Board for approval and (5) reviewing the risk exposure related to the areas of its responsibility. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the compensation committee may delegate to management or to a subcommittee of the compensation committee. The compensation committee has delegated to certain senior members of management the authority to make RSU grants in 2019 to other officers and employees on the same terms as the executive officers, subject to an aggregate number of RSUs approved by the compensation committee. 
The compensation committee also oversees preparation of the compensation discussion and analysis to be included in our annual proxy statement, recommends to the Board of Directors whether to so include the compensation discussion and analysis and provides an accompanying report to be included in our annual proxy statement. 
The compensation committee has engaged Exequity LLP ("Exequity"), a nationally recognized independent compensation consultant, to provide advice with respect to compensation decisions for the non-employee directors of our Board of Directors and our executive officers. 
Each member of our compensation committee qualifies as a "non-employee director" under SEC rules and as an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") for purposes of serving on a compensation committee. Our Board of Directors has also determined that each member of the compensation committee satisfies the additional independence requirements specific to compensation committee membership under the NYSE listing standards. In making this determination, the Board of Directors considered whether the director has a relationship with the Company that is material to the director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a member of the compensation committee. 
Our compensation committee held five meetings in 2018. 
4  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
The Board and Committee Annual Self-Evaluation 
To ensure that the Board of Directors and each Board committee functions effectively, the nominating and corporate governance committee and the Board of Directors annually conducts a self-evaluation to identify and assess areas for improvement. The written assessment focuses on the Board composition and its role, the operation of the Board, the Board's processes relating to the Company's strategy, financial position and corporate governance and the function and effectiveness of the Board committees. The independent Lead Director leads the evaluation process which includes collecting the assessment feedback and conducting a one-on-one conversation with each director. The Lead Director discusses the results of the evaluations and feedback received with the non-employee directors in executive session at its February meeting each year, then shares the results with the employee directors and, as necessary, the Board implements resulting recommendations. 
The Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors has delegated risk oversight responsibilities to the audit committee, except for risks relating to executive compensation. In accordance with its charter, the audit committee is responsible for monitoring the Company's policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The audit committee periodically meets with our senior executives to discuss, among other things, material risks to our business. The audit committee also periodically meets with representatives of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Chairman of the audit committee reports to the full Board of Directors regarding material risks as deemed appropriate. 
The compensation committee provides oversight with respect to risks that may arise from our compensation arrangements and policies. This is accomplished on an ongoing basis through the compensation committee's review and approval of specific arrangements and policies to ensure that they are consistent with our overall compensation philosophy and our business goals. The compensation committee periodically discusses any risk-related concerns with senior management and with its independent compensation consultant. The Chairman of the compensation committee will report to the full Board of Directors regarding any material risks as deemed appropriate. In view of this oversight and based on our ongoing assessment, we do not believe that our present employee compensation arrangements, plans, programs or policies are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
The Board of Directors believes that its governance structure supports the Board's role in risk oversight. Independent directors chair each of the Board committees responsible for risk oversight. The Company has an independent Lead Director who facilitates communication between management and directors, and all directors are involved in the review of key enterprise risks. 
Succession Planning 
Our compensation committee annually reviews succession plans relating to positions held by our executive officers and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the selection of individuals to fill these positions. In addition, annually our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman report to the compensation committee on succession planning for other senior executive positions. Our Board of Directors also maintains an emergency Chief Executive Officer succession plan which will become effective in the event our Chief Executive Officer becomes unable to perform his duties in order to minimize potential disruption to our business and operations. 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  5 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of our compensation committee has at any time been one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve on our Board of Directors or compensation committee. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to assist the Board of Directors in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities and to serve the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Guidelines are intended to serve as a flexible framework for the conduct of the Board of Directors' business and not as a set of legally binding obligations and are periodically reviewed by the Board Directors and amended from time to time. 
The Guidelines describe the Lead Director's and the Board of Directors' responsibilities, the qualification criteria for serving as a director, and standards for the conduct of meetings and establishing and maintaining committees. The Guidelines also confirm that the directors will have full and free access to officers and employees of the Company and have authority to retain independent advisors as necessary and appropriate in carrying out their activities. In addition, the Guidelines establish frameworks for director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, and an annual evaluation of the Board and its committees and of the Guidelines. Finally, the Guidelines charge the compensation committee with oversight of management evaluation and succession, and detail the Company's policies regarding confidentiality and communications between our Board of Directors and the press and media on matters pertaining to the Company. These Guidelines were recently amended to add over-boarding limits which the Company has previously complied with in practice, a requirement that a director must offer to resign if the Board has determined that an actual conflict of interest arises with respect to the director which is not waived by the Board, add emphasis that directors are subject to the Company's Code of Business Conduct described below, clarify our practices regarding communications to our Board of Directors by stockholders and other interested parties and update the Criteria for Nominations as Directors to reflect our practices relating to the consideration of director candidates, including diversity qualifications, as described below. Our Guidelines are available on our website at www.airleasecorp.com. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, employees and officers. Among other things, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is intended to ensure fair and accurate financial reporting, to promote ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to provide guidance with respect to the handling of ethical issues, to foster a culture of honesty and accountability and to deter wrongdoing. It also requires disclosure to us of any situation, transaction or relationship that may give rise to any actual or potential conflict of interest. Such conflicts must be avoided unless approved by our nominating and corporate governance committee. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits our employees, officers and directors from taking, or directing a third party to take, a business opportunity that is discovered through the use of our property. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.airleasecorp.com.

In accordance with our written Related Person Transaction Policy, the nominating and corporate governance committee must review and approve or ratify any transaction in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 if any of our directors, director nominees, executive officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Class A Common Stock, or any of their respective immediate family members, has or may have a direct or indirect material interest in such transaction. Certain limited types of related person transactions are deemed to be pre-approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee even if the amount involved exceeds $120,000. In addition, the Chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee has been delegated the authority to approve or ratify any related person transaction if the amount involved is expected to be less than $1 million. Out of an abundance of caution, the nominating and corporate governance committee will sometimes review and approve or ratify transactions with a related person or an entity affiliated with a related person, even if the related person does not have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. The Company has had no related person transactions since January  1, 2018. 
Consideration of Director Candidates 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating director candidates based on the perceived needs of the Board of Directors at the time. When identifying and evaluating candidates for nomination as new directors, the Board will consider candidates with diverse backgrounds in terms of knowledge, experience, skills, and other characteristics, in particular, gender, ethnic and geographic diversity. The Board of Directors is committed to identifying candidates with gender, ethnic and geographic diversity and is committed to meeting the requirements under a law in California that the Company have three female directors by December 31, 2021. Diversity also may encompass a candidate's educational and professional history, community or public service, expertise or knowledge base and certain unique personal characteristics. The nominating and corporate governance committee does not have a formal policy specifying how diversity of background and personal experience should be applied in identifying or evaluating director candidates, and a candidate's background and personal experience, while important, does not necessarily outweigh other attributes or factors the nominating and corporate governance committee considers in evaluating candidates. 
Among other criteria that the nominating and corporate governance committee may consider include the director candidate's ability to faithfully represent the interests of our stockholders; the candidate's integrity, judgment and independence of thought; an absence of conflicting time commitments; financial literacy; leadership experience; a fit of abilities and personality that helps build an effective, collegial and responsive Board of Directors; a commitment to understand the Company and its industry; and an ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and long-term objectives of the Company and to contribute positively to the decision-making process. 
Any stockholder may recommend a director candidate for our nominating and corporate governance committee to consider by submitting the candidate's name and qualifications to us in care of the Secretary at the address for our principal executive office listed on the cover page of this Proxy Statement. Director candidates recommended by a stockholder are considered in the same manner as any other candidates, although the nominating and corporate governance committee may prefer candidates who are personally known to the existing directors and whose reputations are highly regarded. Our nominating and corporate governance committee has not retained professional search firms to assist it in recruiting potential director candidates. 
Stockholders of record seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders (as opposed to making a recommendation to the nominating and corporate governance

 committee as described above) or to bring other business before our annual meeting of stockholders, may do so by providing timely notice of their intent in writing by the deadlines specified in our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") For more information, see the section below titled Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders and any other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors or an individual director, including our independent Lead Director or our independent directors as a group, or any Board committee or any chairperson of any Board committee, by either name or title, may send written communications care of the Corporate Secretary of the Company (the "Secretary") at the address for our principal executive office listed on the cover page of this Proxy Statement. All such communications will be opened by the Secretary or his or her designee for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to the Company's directors. The Secretary will forward copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or its committees or that he or she otherwise determines requires the attention of any member, group or committee of the Board. The Secretary will not forward junk mail, job inquiries, business solicitations, offensive or otherwise inappropriate materials. 
Director Compensation 
Our Board of Directors sets non-employee director compensation based on recommendations from the compensation committee. The compensation committee reviews, at least annually, the compensation (both cash and equity-based award compensation) of non-employee directors for service on the Board and its committees. The compensation committee's independent compensation consultant, Exequity, assists in this review, including obtaining market information, annually benchmarking our director compensation and designing various aspects of our compensation program for the directors. After its review, the compensation committee recommends any changes to the Board for approval. Directors who also serve as employees to the Company (currently Messrs. Udvar-Házy and Plueger) do not receive separate compensation for their service on our Board of Directors.

There has been no change in the above fees since 2012. 
8  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
Effective January 1, 2017, non-employee directors may be paid conditional meeting fees in the event that in the future there are periods of unexpected and increased participation required by the non-employee directors, and a per diem fee in certain circumstances. 
A non-employee director will receive a meeting fee of $1,500 per meeting (i) if he or she attends a number of Board meetings in excess of the number of scheduled meetings plus two additional Board meetings during the applicable calendar year or (ii) if he or she attends during the applicable year a number of meetings of a committee on which he or she serves, in excess of the number of scheduled meetings plus two additional meetings of that committee for that year. No fees for attending additional meetings were paid in 2018. 
Non-employee directors may be paid a per diem fee of $2,500 for non-ordinary course Board or committee activity (excluding any educational events) subject to the approval of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Lead Director of the Board. No per diem fees were paid in 2018. 
As a matter of policy each director could elect to have his or her retainer paid in cash or shares of our Class A Common Stock, or a combination thereof. 
Equity Awards 
Each non-employee director who joins our Board of Directors receives an initial grant of RSUs to be settled in shares of our Class A Common Stock ("Initial Director Grant") with an aggregate value of $180,000. Thereafter, each year our non-employee directors receive an annual RSU award to be settled in shares of Class A Common Stock (the "Annual Director Grant") with an aggregate value of $120,000. There has been no change in the dollar value of the equity awards since 2014. 
The value of all grants of RSUs is based on the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. All RSUs awarded to our non-employee directors vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date, and if the Board of Directors service of such a director terminates for any reason, other than following a change in control, the RSUs will vest on a daily prorated basis according to the number of days between the grant date and the termination of service, divided by 365. If the service terminates following a change in control, the RSUs will vest in full. The Initial Director Grants and the Annual Director Grants are made pursuant to the Air Lease Corporation 2014 Equity Incentive Plan or any successor plan. 
Since January 1, 2015, each director may annually elect to defer the receipt of his or her Annual Director Grant shares beyond the one-year vesting period. Directors may elect to defer his or her shares until separation from service or alternatively, may elect a deferral period of five years or ten years from the date of grant, provided that shares will be distributed upon a separation from service, a change of control or at death, if earlier than the elected deferral date. Deferred RSUs receive dividend equivalents which are reinvested in additional RSUs based on the market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date the dividends are paid. 
On May 9, 2018, each non-employee director received an Annual Director Grant. 
Other Arrangements 
We reimbursed directors for travel and lodging expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings. We also have entered into agreements with each of our non-employee directors to provide them with indemnification and advancement of expenses to supplement that provided under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, subject to certain requirements and limitations.

Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors. Each non-employee director has five years from the time he or she becomes subject to these guidelines to achieve ownership of Class A Common Stock equivalents with an aggregate market value equal to three times the amount of the then current annual cash retainer fee for service on our Board of Directors. For a non-employee director, Class A Common Stock equivalents are shares of Class A Common Stock personally owned by the director, shares of Class A Common Stock underlying vested RSUs awarded to a director and shares of Class A Common Stock underlying unvested RSUs awarded to a director that are subject to time vesting only. All directors have met or exceeded the guidelines as set forth in the table below.

Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
At the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors is recommending to stockholders that Mr. Matthew J. Hart, Ms. Cheryl Gordon Krongard, Mr. Marshall O Larsen, Mr. Robert A. Milton, Mr. John L. Plueger, Mr. Ian M. Saines, Dr. Ronald D. Sugar and Mr. Steven F. Udvar-Házy each be elected as a director to serve for a one-year term ending at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified our until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Each of the nominees named below is currently a director and was elected at the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 9, 2018. No arrangement or undertaking exists between any nominee and any other person or persons pursuant to which any nominee was or is to be selected as a director or nominee, and there are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. Each nominee has consented to be nominated and has agreed to serve as a director if elected. Should any of these individuals become unable to serve as a director prior to the Annual Meeting, the proxies for the Annual Meeting will, unless otherwise directed, vote for the election of such other individual as the Board of Directors may recommend, unless the Board in its discretion reduces the number of directors. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any of the director nominees will be unable or unwilling to stand as a nominee or to serve as a director if elected. 
Under our Bylaws, a director nominee will be elected to the Board of Directors by a majority of the votes cast, meaning the votes cast "FOR" such nominee's election must exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" such nominee's election at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the director election because they are not treated as votes cast.

Proposal 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Our audit committee has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements for 2019. During 2018, KPMG served as our independent public accounting firm and provided certain other audit-related services. Representatives of KPMG are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, make a statement. 
This is a non-binding vote. If KPMG's appointment is not ratified, the audit committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG, but still may retain KPMG. Even if the appointment is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be appropriate. 
Approval of the ratification of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Class A Common Stock present or represented, and entitled to vote on the proposal, at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal.

Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation 
We are seeking an advisory vote from our stockholders to approve our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in the section titled Executive Compensation. Consistent with the recommendation of the Board and the majority of votes cast at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company has currently determined that advisory votes to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers will take place every year. Our named executive officers include Mr. John Plueger, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. Udvar-Házy, our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and the three other executive officers named in the tables that appear in the Executive Compensation section. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain the most talented individuals in the aircraft leasing business and to create long-term value for our stockholders. The compensation committee and our Board of Directors believe that the program has been successful in accomplishing these objectives as reflected by our strong financial performance in 2018. 
The combination of a competitive base salary and bonus, and the potential for even greater rewards as a stockholder, has helped us assemble and retain a formidable management team and focus them on growing the value of the Company over the long term. We believe having a small, but highly experienced and motivated senior management team is essential to the success of the Company and provides us with an important competitive advantage. 
Stockholders are urged to read the section titled Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which contains a detailed description of how our compensation program implements our compensation philosophy. 
We are asking our stockholders to vote FOR the following advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Air Lease Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to its named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion set forth below in the section titled Executive Compensation. 
This is a non-binding vote and is being provided as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. The compensation committee and our Board of Directors will continue to review the voting results in connection with their regular evaluation of our compensation program. They also will continue to consider any input from our major stockholders throughout the year in connection with their annual evaluation. 
Approval of this advisory vote requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Class A Common Stock present or represented, and entitled to vote on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory vote.

        Compensation Committee Letter 
[END TABLE]
Dear Fellow Stockholder, 
As stewards of the Air Lease Corporation compensation program, we – the members of the compensation committee – are highly focused on ensuring that our compensation program promotes the creation of stockholder value. We accomplish this by delivering approximately 70% of our executives' target compensation in performance-based vehicles and setting robust goals that challenge our executives to contribute to our annual and long-term objectives and reward them when those objectives are achieved. 
We made many changes to our 2018 compensation program that are reflected throughout this proxy statement and noted below. As a result of these changes, our compensation program provides for more at-risk compensation, including more compensation being delivered in equity and subject to long-term Company performance. 
Key Changes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Changing the structure of our Executive Chairman's 2018 annual bonus so that in lieu of cash he was granted a stock  bonus award in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs") on February 20, 2019, the date the dollar amount of his 2018 cash bonus was determined. These RSUs cliff vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. We believe that  denominating our Executive Chairman's annual bonus in stock instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairman's compensation with stockholder's long-term interests. As a result  of this change, the only cash compensation that was paid to our Executive Chairman in 2018 was his base salary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Streamlining the performance metrics for our 2018 annual bonus to have equally weighted  top-line and bottom-line performance metrics to further incentivize the achievement of profitable growth.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Changing our Book Value RSUs in several ways to further drive long-term sustainable book value growth:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     2018 Book Value RSUs cliff vest at the end of three years versus previous years grants that vested ratably each year  over three years, so that the one-year performance periods have been eliminated;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Increased weighting of Book Value RSUs relative to TSR RSUs because we believe incentivizing the executives to grow our  long-term book value per share in a capital-intensive business like ours will lead to value creation for stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Reset actual target book value per share growth at the beginning of 2018 and made target book value growth harder to reach  compared to previous years grants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Revised the terms so that the opportunity associated with the Book Value RSUs can vary from  0%-200% of target.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Terminating our remaining executive officers' participation in the Deferred Cash Bonus Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Developing a new more refined benchmark group consisting of 18 companies across diversified financial services and real  estate investment trusts based on quantitative and qualitative factors, including company size, business model and financial profile.  
[END TABLE]
We received significant positive feedback regarding our compensation program, and preserved the features that resonated with investors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual equity program with a significant portion tied to growth in book value per share; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive program metrics that align our management team with our strategic priorities.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be read together with the executive compensation tables that follow, which disclose the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our NEOs with respect to 2018. 
Compensation Philosophy: Pay for Performance 
Our executive compensation program is designed for a company with a small number of extraordinary and talented individuals with industry experience to manage and lead a highly capital-intensive business. We do this by tying compensation to the achievement of performance goals that promote the creation of stockholder value and by designing compensation to reward and retain our high-caliber executives in a competitive market. This balancing of objectives is demonstrated by the substantial portion of our executives' compensation that is variable and at risk based on individual and Company performance. In 2018, 72% of our CEO's pay mix at target was at risk. Our compensation structure and pay for performance philosophy have incentivized our 97-employee team to deliver outstanding long-term performance at a very low cost to stockholders. In fact, in 2018 our entire compensation expense (for all employees) represented just 3.8% of revenues. In addition, all of our employees are eligible to receive RSUs and our employees and directors own approximately 9% of our Class A Common Stock. We believe that this significant ownership by our employees and directors also helps ensure that we are aligned with the interests of our stockholders and that our compensation program drives sustainable growth.

Business Overview and Strategy 
Business Overview 
Air Lease Corporation is a leading aircraft leasing company that was founded by aircraft leasing industry pioneer, Steven F. Udvar-Házy. We are principally engaged in purchasing new commercial jet transport aircraft directly from the manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus. We lease these aircraft to airlines throughout the world to generate attractive returns on equity. As of December 31, 2018, we owned a fleet of 275 aircraft and had 372 aircraft on order and 50 aircraft purchase options with the manufacturers. In addition to our leasing activities, we sell aircraft from our fleet to other leasing companies, financial services companies, airlines and through our asset-backed securities platform. We also provide fleet management services to investors and owners of aircraft portfolios for a management fee. Our operating performance is driven by the growth of our fleet, the terms of our leases, the interest rates on our debt and the aggregate amount of our indebtedness, supplemented by the gains of our aircraft sales and trading activities and our management fees. We have relationships with over 200 airlines across 70 countries, and as of December 31, 2018, had 94 customers in 56 countries.

Stockholder Outreach and Executive Compensation Program Refinements 
To better understand our investors' perspectives regarding our executive compensation program, for the last several years we have engaged in stockholder outreach. After issuing our proxy statement in March 2018, we engaged with holders of 49% of outstanding shares (none of whom were our employees or directors) to specifically discuss our compensation philosophy and program and to listen to their feedback. The compensation committee considered our stockholders' views when making decisions about changes to our 2018 and 2019 compensation programs. 
We continued to enhance our executive compensation program in response to evolving compensation practices and feedback from our stockholder engagement efforts, specifically by making the following responsive changes:

    ✓    Changed our Executive Chairmans  Annual Bonus.    In 2018, we changed the structure of our Executive Chairmans annual bonus so that in lieu of cash he was granted a stock bonus award in the form of RSUs on February 20, 2019, the date the dollar  amount of his 2018 annual bonus was determined. These RSUs cliff vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The number of RSUs was equal to the dollar amount of his 2018 cash bonus divided by the closing price of our common stock on the  date of grant. We believe denominating our Executive Chairmans annual bonus in stock instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairmans compensation with stockholders  long-term interests.   As a result of this change in bonus structure, the only cash  compensation that was paid to our Executive Chairman in 2018 was his base salary.

         Streamlined the Performance Metrics for  our Annual Bonus.    In 2018, we reduced the number of operating performance metrics to two from four in 2017 by removing pre-tax operating margin and dollar value of aircraft added to  our fleet. We increased the component weighting to 40% each for the two 2018 performance metrics, Overall Revenue and Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Equity. We believe that focusing on two key operating metrics  simplifies the program to effectively drive profitable growth. 50% of the metrics focus on top-line performance and the remaining 50% focuses on profitability. These metrics also provide greater transparency  to stockholders because these performance metrics are reported in the Company's SEC filed financial statements.   By streamlining our annual bonus plan structure and using equally weighted top-line and bottom-line performance metrics, we  believe we have simplified our plan and further focused our executives on achieving profitable growth for our stockholders.

In 2018, we developed a new more refined benchmark group consisting of 18 companies across diversified financial services and real estate investment trusts based on quantitative and qualitative  factors, including company size, business model and financial profile. Based on a 2019 study prepared by the compensation committees independent compensation consultant using 2017 data, the total direct compensation paid to our Chief Executive  Officer and our Executive Chairman approximated the median total direct compensation paid by the custom benchmark group members to their similarly situated executive officers, while the total direct compensation paid to our other NEOs was either  slightly above or slightly below the median total direct compensation paid by the custom benchmark group members to their similarly situated executive officers.   We believe the data from the Custom Benchmark Group is valuable to the compensation committee in determining the competitiveness of our compensation and any  compensation adjustments.

Stockholder Advisory Vote Approving Executive Compensation 
Consistent with the recommendation of the Board and the majority of votes cast at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company has currently determined that advisory votes to approve the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers will take place every year. 
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation ("compensation proposal") received the affirmative support of over 70% of our stockholders represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. In evaluating our executive compensation program, our compensation committee considered the voting results for the compensation proposal, our stockholder outreach and other factors as discussed in this CD&A. 
Compensation Program Overview and Objectives 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain and motivate the highest caliber executives in the aircraft leasing industry by offering a comprehensive compensation program that is attractive enough to entice and retain successful senior executives. We also believe it is important that our compensation program attracts the highly talented executive who is experienced and capable of managing our aircraft fleet with a small team to help drive our profitability. At the end of 2018, we had total assets of $18.5 billion and we had 97 total employees. We believe that the ratio of employees to total assets compares favorably to other companies in capital-intensive businesses. In addition to managing significant assets on a per employee basis, our team has delivered outstanding long-term performance at a very low cost to stockholders. In fact, in 2018 our entire compensation expense (for all employees) represented just 3.8% of revenues. 
32  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
Our executive compensation program also is designed to reward our executives for contributing to the achievement of our annual and long-term objectives. We set robust goals to align performance-based compensation with the creation of long-term value for our stockholders. We also believe that ownership of our stock is critical to alignment with our stockholders and our 97 employees along with our independent directors collectively own approximately 9% of the Company. 
How We Determine Compensation 
Role of the compensation committee.    The compensation committee is composed of Dr. Sugar, who serves as Chairman of the committee, Ms. Krongard and Mr. Milton. The compensation committee oversees the design, administration and evaluation of our overall executive compensation program. The compensation committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman, evaluates their performance in light of those goals and objectives, and recommends to the independent directors of the Board their compensation level based on this evaluation. It also approves the total compensation for the other NEOs. Each member of the compensation committee must be an independent, non-employee director, as those terms are defined in SEC, NYSE and Internal Revenue Service rules. Among other things, the compensation committee will at least annually: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and adjust (or recommend adjustments to) each NEO's compensation in order to ensure an appropriate mix of cash  and equity, and an appropriate balance of fixed and at-risk compensation, in light of, among other factors, each individual's particular role and responsibilities, personal motivations, stock ownership  exposure and wealth accumulation. As described below, annually we also assess the competitiveness of our NEOs compensation to determine if adjustments are warranted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consult with the compensation committee's independent compensation consultant to help ensure that the total  compensation paid to each NEO is appropriate in light of our compensation objectives, tax and accounting considerations and compensation best practices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consider specific input from stockholders on our executive compensation programs in the design of the next year's  executive compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Design annual incentive awards with quantitative factors and qualitative milestones applicable to all our officers that  further our overall business objectives, and approve award payouts based on performance actually achieved.  
[END TABLE]
Role of Stockholder Input on Executive Compensation.    To better understand our investors' perspectives regarding our executive compensation program, for the last several years we have engaged in stockholder outreach. We spoke with stockholders in the spring of 2018 after issuing our proxy statement and again in early 2019. That outreach and the changes made to our 2018 and 2019 executive compensation program in response to that outreach are described more fully in the section titled Stockholder Outreach and Executive Compensation Program Refinements. These changes resulted for 2018 in changes in the performance metrics for our NEOs annual cash bonus, a change in the structure of our Executive Chairman's annual bonus so that any bonus earned is paid in RSUs subject to vesting, changes in our Book Value RSUs to eliminate one-year performance periods and move to a three-year performance period instead to further drive long-term sustainable book value growth and termination of our executive officers participating in the deferred cash bonus plan. For 2018 we also developed a new, more refined benchmark group and believe that our NEOs' total direct compensation is competitively positioned at approximately the median relative to similarly situated executives at the benchmark group companies. We encourage stockholders to reach out with any questions or feedback related to our compensation program, and we are committed to hearing from our stockholders as part of our annual outreach process. 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  33 
Role of Management.    Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor the Executive Chairman has any role in determining his compensation or the compensation of the other. Moreover, they are not present when his compensation is discussed and approved by the compensation committee or the Board of Directors. The compensation committee determines the overall compensation of our other NEOs with input from our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. None of our NEOs is present when his compensation is discussed by the compensation committee. Our management administers all compensation and benefits programs, subject to the oversight of the compensation committee. This delegation to management is strictly limited to implementation of the programs, and does not include any discretion to make material decisions regarding the overall executive compensation program. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant.    The compensation committee has engaged Exequity as an independent compensation consultant to provide advice with respect to compensation decisions for our executive officers. The independent compensation consultant assists in evaluating our compensation objectives, obtaining market information, and designing various aspects of our compensation program. The independent compensation consultant attends meetings of the compensation committee by invitation, and committee members have direct access to the independent compensation consultant without management involvement. The independent compensation consultant will also consult with our senior executives as directed by the compensation committee. The compensation committee has the sole authority to hire and fire the independent compensation consultant. In order to help ensure impartiality and objectivity, the compensation committee requires that the independent compensation consultant provide services only to the committee and not to management, absent specific committee approval. In 2018, Exequity did not perform any services unrelated to its compensation committee engagement, including any separate work for our management or employees. The independence of Exequity has been evaluated in accordance with SEC and NYSE rules, and it has been determined that its work did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
Peer Group and Benchmarking 
We operate in a highly-specialized industry in which most of the companies are foreign, private or are subsidiaries of other large companies. For this reason, traditional industry specific peer group benchmarking is challenging and would produce incomparable data. 
Given that we have limited direct publicly-traded peers, it is equally challenging to find relevant and directly comparable compensation benchmarking data for our industry. Nevertheless, since 2012, Exequity has collected compensation information about similarly sized U.S.-based employers for the compensation committee's consideration derived from the entire S&P MidCap 400 Index. This is the group against which the Company benchmarks relative total stockholder return for TSR RSU performance purposes and reflects comparably capitalized companies regardless of industry affiliation. 
Before 2018, the compensation committee considered compensation data of selected diversified financial services firms from the Diversified Financial Services Benchmark. While the data was valuable to the compensation committee, this benchmark group was large with 40 companies and included companies not relevant to the Company's core business. As a result, in the fall of 2017 the compensation committee asked Exequity to work with the Company to explore developing a new custom benchmark group. 
In developing the new custom benchmark group in early 2018, Exequity and the Company performed a comparative top-down and bottom-up business model analysis on companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. with market capitalization between $1 billion and $10 billion at that time. That analysis compared key characteristics of the Company's business, including exposure to real assets, dependence on a highly skilled management team, credit exposure/underwriting expertise, and significant capital expenditures, to the characteristics of traditional and alternative asset managers, specialty finance lenders, insurance companies and REITs (real estate investment trusts). The analysis included all companies within the 
34  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
 Diversified Financial Services Benchmark. A range of REITs were included because of their exposure to real assets, income from lease revenue, highly skilled management teams, large capital bases and significant capital expenditures. The remaining firms selected represent an array of asset management and specialty finance firms which the Company believes exhibit in-depth knowledge of their asset classes akin to the Company's expertise in managing aircraft. A separate review was done of the companies that were within the Diversified Financial Services Benchmark but would not be included in the custom benchmark group. Companies such as institutional brokerage firms, information services companies and consumer finance companies were excluded from the new benchmark group given the disparity in their business models to aircraft leasing. 
For 2018, the compensation committee adopted a new custom benchmark group consisting of the following companies (the "Custom Benchmark Group"):

In order to assess the Company's compensation competitiveness compared to the Custom Benchmark Group, in the beginning of 2019, Exequity utilized comparative data disclosed in publicly available proxy statements and other documents filed with the SEC and other databases to prepare a study comparing the NEOs' compensation to the compensation paid by the Custom Benchmark Group members to their executives. Exequity's study generally utilized compensation data for the 2017 calendar year, as that was the most recent compensation information available at the time of the study. The total direct compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Chairman approximated the median total direct compensation paid by the Custom Benchmark Group members to their similarly situated executive officers, while the total direct compensation paid to our other NEOs was either slightly above or slightly below the median total direct compensation paid by the Custom Benchmark Group members to their similarly situated executive officers. Total direct compensation for this purpose means the sum of 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  35 
 base salary, actual bonus earned and the grant date fair value of equity awards granted for the applicable year. In addition, our total NEO compensation for 2017 as a percentage of our net income of 3.2%, was less than the 25th percentile of the Custom Benchmark Group percentage of total NEO compensation for 2017 as a percentage of net income, of 3.6%. 
For 2019 actions, the compensation committee considered data from the S&P MidCap 400 and the Custom Benchmark Group. External compensation data is considered holistically and represents potential labor markets for top executive talent for similar companies. The committee also viewed data for Aircastle Limited, the sole aircraft leasing company where compensation data is available and a member of the Custom Benchmark Group. However, given the significant difference between our aircraft leasing business and the companies included in these data sources, our compensation committee does not make explicit compensation decisions based on how our compensation practices compare, nor do they target compensation to a specific benchmark of this group of companies. We use this information as a starting point in our compensation review process, to supplement the collective knowledge and experience of our Board of Directors, senior executives and the compensation consultant. Our final compensation decisions continue to be based on individual performance, and guided by what we consider to be the amount and form of compensation that will best enable us to attract, motivate and retain the most talented executives and to focus them on the growth and long-term success of our business. 
Risk Management 
We believe we have designed an executive compensation program as described below which encourages long-term incentive goals for our NEOs and discourages executives from taking unnecessary risks that could threaten the long-term interests of our company. We also base our executive rewards on a variety of internal performance measures (as explained below) so as to avoid an over reliance on any singular indicator of performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align NEO's compensation with stockholders: We believe that the best way to ensure our NEOs' and other  employees' personal commitment to our long-term goals is to ensure that their financial rewards as stockholders will, over the long term, far outweigh any cash compensation they earn as employees. In this regard, the interests of our NEOs and  our stockholders are strongly aligned. Our NEOs as a group beneficially own approximately 8% of our Class A Common Stock, and each NEO has made a meaningful personal investment in our stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentive Program: A significant portion of our regular annual equity awards granted since 2012 have been  tied to performance-based vesting conditions based on book value and total stockholder return metrics, as described in more detail in this CD&A.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Book Value: 50% of our long-term incentive-based compensation has been tied to an increase in our book value, and not to  metrics that may encourage risk-taking behavior focused on short-term results. Beginning in 2018 awards tied to an increase in book value will only vest if at the end of three years the book value performance measure is met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Total Stockholder Return: Since 2012, a portion of our long-term incentive awards has been based on stockholder returns  relative to a broad index. Awards tied to total stockholder returns vest at the end of three years if the performance measures are met. Beginning in 2018, 25% of our award is tied to total stockholder return.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Time-Based: Beginning in 2018, 25% of the annual equity awards are time-based and will vest annually in three equal  installments on the anniversary of the grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive Awards are Capped: We have also capped our short and long-term incentive opportunities;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     Beginning in 2018, performance-based RSUs that vest based on book value and the total stockholder return (TSR) RSUs are  capped at 200% of target to limit potential payouts even in  
[END TABLE]
36  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     instances of superior performance. TSR RSUs granted prior to 2018 were similarly capped at 200% of target, and there was no upside opportunity associated with the Book Value RSUs granted prior to  2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     In addition, the compensation committee caps the annual bonuses of our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Chairman  at 200% of target.  
[END TABLE]
As an additional safeguard, our Board of Directors also adopted a claw back policy relating to incentive compensation and an anti-hedging or pledging policy as described below. 
We believe that the above design safeguards align our executive incentives and corresponding payouts with stockholder value creation. 
Also, annually, the compensation committee, together with its independent compensation consultant, performs a compensation risk analysis of our compensation programs. In addition, the chair of our compensation committee reports to and discusses compensation risk issues with the full Board of Directors. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines.    We also believe that our executives' significant equity ownership in our Company aligns their long-term interests with those of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers at the level of Executive Vice President or higher. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are each required to own Class A Common Stock equivalents with an aggregate market value equal to six times his annual rate of salary. As shown in the table below, both Mr. Plueger and Mr. Udvar-Házy beneficially own shares of our Class A Common Stock that far exceed their ownership requirements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

2.  Based on the closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on March 12, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Each of our other executive officers subject to these guidelines is required to own Class A Common Stock equivalents with an aggregate market value equal to at least his or her annual rate of salary. Messrs. Chen, Levy and Willis each own shares of our Class A Common Stock that exceed this requirement. In addition, our guidelines require executive officers to retain 50% of after-tax profits realized from Company equity incentive awards until ownership guidelines are met. Class A Common Stock equivalents are shares of Class A Common Stock owned personally by an executive officer and shares of Class A Common Stock underlying unvested RSUs that are subject to time-based vesting only. Each executive officer subject to these guidelines has five years from the time he or she becomes subject to the guidelines to achieve the required level of ownership. 
No Hedging or Pledging.    The Company has an anti-hedging policy applicable to our directors and all employees. These individuals are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions such as short-term or speculative transactions in the Company's securities, including our Class A Common Stock or any preferred stock. Directors and executive officers may not pledge their Company securities as collateral for a loan or in similar transactions. 
Clawback Policy.    In February 2014 our Board of Directors adopted a clawback policy. The policy provides that we will require reimbursement of any incentive payments to an executive officer which was 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  37 
 predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial restatement of Company financial statements filed with the SEC, if our Board of Directors determines that the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or substantially caused the need for a substantial restatement of financial results and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based on the restated financial results. In each such instance, we will to the extent practicable, seek to recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. 
Elements of the Executive Compensation Program 
We have three primary elements of our executive compensation program: annual compensation consisting of base salary, annual performance-based incentive bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards. Their significant performance-based compensation coupled with their significant ownership of the Company's equity aligns each NEO's interests with the interests of our stockholders. In 2018, approximately 72% of our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation paid was performance-based and not guaranteed. 
Annual Compensation 
Annual compensation is delivered in cash (or for Mr. Udvar-Házy, a combination of cash and RSUs) with a substantial variable portion at risk and contingent on the successful accomplishment of pre-established performance measures. 
Base Salary.    Base salary is the main "fixed" component of our executive compensation program, and it is aimed primarily at attracting and retaining the best possible executive talent. The relative levels of base salary for our NEOs are based on the particular responsibilities and expectations associated with each executive's position. Another factor that we consider extremely important is the experience of each NEO in our industry. We review salaries annually and consider possible merit increases, increases in connection with promotions and changes in responsibilities and market competitive factors. 
None of our NEOs are guaranteed an annual salary increase. The salaries for Messrs. Plueger and Udvar-Házy remained unchanged since 2016. For Mr. Udvar-Házy, his 2018 base salary was the only cash compensation he received in 2018, as his 2018 annual bonus was paid in RSUs that are subject to an additional two-year vesting requirement. The base salaries of the other NEOs are determined by the compensation committee, with the input of Messrs. Plueger and Udvar-Házy taking into consideration the objectives and philosophies of our overall executive compensation program, including market information. 
The 2018 base salary percentage changes for our NEO's compared to 2017 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Title         Increase% compared to 2017       
      Title         Increase% compared to 2017

 Executive Vice President & Managing Director, Asia      0%    
 Executive Vice President      0%    
 Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer         3.28%       
[END TABLE]
Performance-Based Annual Incentives.    We pay annual bonuses to drive the achievement of key business results for the year and to recognize individuals based on their contributions to those results. Each year the compensation committee establishes performance guidelines for bonus payments 
38  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
 ("performance measures"). These performance measures are developed taking into account the Company's applicable fiscal year plan and its long-term strategy. These performance measures also take into account expectations regarding probability of achieving certain performance goals and include "stretch" goals that are supported by the business plan. Performance measures are set at the beginning of the performance period. 
For 2018, as compared to 2017, the compensation committee decided to reduce from 4 to 2 the number of operating performance measures, and to increase the component weighting percentage of each of these measures in determining the annual incentive awards to be paid to our NEOs. The key benefits to these changes included simplification, less sensitivity to aircraft delays and a desire to equally weight top-line and bottom-line performance measures to incentivize profitable growth. In addition, the compensation committee also thought it was important to use performance measures that are publicly reported in the Company's SEC filed financial statements so that our performance measures and targets are transparent to our stockholders. 
Based on the above, the compensation committee developed the following performance measures for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Performance Measures       Component Weighting     Link to Strategy 
    Performance Measures       Component Weighting     Link to Strategy 
 Overall Revenue     40%     Incentivizes top line growth (1)   
 Overall Revenue     40%     Incentivizes top line growth (1)   
 Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Equity (2)    40%    Incentivizes profitable growth and efficient use of stockholders capital (1)   
 Strategic Objectives    20%    Incentivizes focus on strategic priorities that grow stockholder value   
(1)  For 2018, the component weighting of this performance measure was increased to 40% from 20% in 2017.   
(2)  As defined and reported in the Company's financial statements as filed with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
The 2018 strategic objectives required our NEOs to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meet or exceed cumulative aircraft placement goals through 2021  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Add new airline customers  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meet or exceed incremental CapEx goal under the Company's 2018 Financial Plan  
[END TABLE]
For 2018 performance, the compensation committee measured our performance to these operating performance measures and strategic goals, using a rating scale versus expectations as follows: 0% - did not meet expectations, 80% - mostly meets expectations, 100% - meets expectations, 120% - exceeds expectations and 200% - significantly exceeds expectations. In 2017 we measured our performance to these operating performance measures, and strategic goals, using each performance measure or strategic goal's minimum, target and maximum outcomes only. We believe this refinement in our interpolation methodology will better align company performance and executive compensation for performance results between the minimum and target performance levels, and between the target and maximum performance levels. 
We also made changes to the structure of Mr. Udvar-Házy's 2018 annual incentive opportunity. In lieu of his cash bonus he was granted a stock bonus award in the form of RSUs on February 20, 2019, the date the amount of his 2018 annual bonus was determined. These RSUs cliff vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The number of RSUs was equal to the dollar amount of his 2018 cash bonus divided by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The amount of the bonus was determined 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  39 
 under the bonus framework described above. We believe denominating our Executive Chairman's annual bonus in stock instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairman's compensation with stockholder's long-term interests. 
2018 Operating Performance Measures Compared to 2017.    The compensation committee also continued its practice of establishing more rigorous goals tied to increasingly ambitious operating performance measures, when appropriate. The tables below show the 2018 goals at 'Target' compared to 2017 target and actual performance.

With respect to our strategic objectives, the compensation committee quantitatively, and as applicable, qualitatively, assesses the Company's performance of its strategic objectives. Each quarter the Company reports to the compensation committee and the full Board of Directors on its progress with a full assessment by the compensation committee after year end. This year, the compensation committee measured our performance. To each strategic goal, using a rating scale versus expectations as follows: 0% - did not meet, 80% - mostly meets, 100% - meets, 120% - exceeds and 200% - significantly exceeds. If all of the goals meet expectations, payout is at 100% and if all of the goals significantly exceed expectations, payout is at 200%. Results between the points are interpolated on a linear basis.

Individual 2018 Performance.    The compensation committee also considered the individual performance of each of the NEOs. It considered, among other things, their individual contributions to our strong financial results in 2018, contributions to our longer-term growth in 2019 and beyond and leadership within the Company, including their ability to motivate and leverage a very small team of professionals. 
The compensation committee recognized Messrs. Plueger's and Udvar-Házy's individual contributions in leveraging industry relationships to grow our fleet, concluding opportunistic aircraft acquisitions and sales, building our management business and developing strategic initiatives. The compensation committee recognized Mr. Chen's contributions in executing on key leasing deals and cultivating an increasing number of relationships within Asia and expanding our presence in Asia through our new Hong Kong office. The compensation committee also recognized Mr. Levy's contributions to our increased leasing 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  41 
 activities as well as his management of our airframe and engine manufacturing agreements. The compensation committee recognized Mr. Willis' execution of our financial plan, including facilitating highly successful financing transactions. 
After evaluating the Company's strong performance relative to the guidelines established at the beginning of 2018 and taking into account individual contributions in 2018, our compensation committee awarded Messrs. Chen, Levy, and Willis annual cash performance bonuses in the amounts set forth below and our compensation committee approved and recommended, and our independent Board of Directors approved, annual cash performance bonuses for Messrs.

**  In 2018, we changed the structure of our Executive Chairman's annual bonus so that in lieu of cash he was granted a  stock bonus award in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs") on February 20, 2019, the date the dollar amount of his 2018 annual bonus was determined. These RSUs cliff vest on the second anniversary of the date of grant. The  number of RSUs was equal to $3,456,000 (the dollar amount of his 2018 cash bonus) divided by $38.32 (the closing price of our common stock on February 20, 2019). We believe denominating our Executive Chairman's annual bonus in stock  instead of cash and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairman's compensation with stockholders' long-term interests.  
[END TABLE]
Plans Applicable to our Annual Incentive Bonuses.    For 2018, the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan provided for annual awards to our NEOs that recognize and reward the achievement of corporate performance goals. Incentive awards are payable under the plan only if the Company has positive income before taxes for the period, and this requirement was met for the 2018 performance period. The total bonus pool cannot exceed 5% of the Company's total revenues, and in 2018 the bonus pool far exceeded actual payments. With the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in 2017, bonuses payable under the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan in 2018 were no longer eligible for the qualified performance-based compensation exception to the $1.0 million executive compensation deductibility limit under Section 162 (m) of the Code. For 2019, annual performance-based bonuses will become payable under the terms of our new Annual Cash Bonus Plan that has replaced the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan and is described in more detail below. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
Philosophy of Awarding Performance-Based Equity Incentive Compensation.     Consistent with our executive compensation objectives, the compensation committee believes that an important aspect of attracting and retaining exceptionally talented executives and aligning their interests with those of our stockholders is to provide long-term equity incentive compensation comprised of both performance-based and time-based equity awards. In determining the value of annual long-term equity grants, the compensation committee considers the executive's total compensation, target cash, mix of long-term and short-term compensation and internal guidelines. 
42  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
On February 20, 2018, we made long-term equity incentive awards to all of our NEOs as part of our planned equity grant cycle. These long-term equity incentive awards were in the form of Book Value and TSR performance awards and Time-based RSU awards. These awards were made under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. All RSUs awarded in 2018 are denominated in share units, each of which is equivalent to one share of our Class A Common Stock. 
Our compensation committee established an overall value for each executive officer, and applied a mix of 50% Book Value RSUs that vest based on attainment of book value goals, 25% TSR RSUs that vest based on attainment of total stockholder return goals, and 25% Time-based RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments. The compensation committee continues to believe that a mix of both Book Value RSUs and TSR RSUs creates a balanced performance-based incentive because the RSUs provide executives with the incentive to steadily increase the book value of the Company while also seeking an overall increase in total stockholder return over a three-year period. However, in 2018 the compensation committee increased the weighting of Book Value RSUs relative to TSR RSUs because it believed that incentivizing the executives to grow our long-term book value per share in a capital-intensive business like ours will lead to value creation for stockholders and create a mix of incentives that we believe will drive long-term performance. 
The chart below shows the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the 2018 long-term incentive awards at the time of grant:

The Company's TSR is the change in price of a share of Class A Common Stock plus accumulated dividends over a specified period of time and is an indicator of management's achievement of long-term growth in stockholder value. Comparing the Company's TSR over a specified period of time to index companies' returns over the same period of time is an objective external measure of the Company's effectiveness in translating its results into stockholder returns. The compensation committee uses the TSR goals against the S&P MidCap 400 Index as the compensation committee believes it represents a broad range of investment alternatives with similar market capitalization as our Company. The compensation committee also believes that tying a portion of our executive compensation to stockholder returns measured against stockholder returns of similarly capitalized companies emphasizes our pay-for-performance philosophy. As previously discussed, we operate in a highly specialized industry with a finite number of other direct comparator companies, many of which are foreign, private or are subsidiaries of other companies. For this reason, traditional industry specific peer group benchmarking is challenging and would produce incomparable data.

Time-Based RSUs.    The Time-based RSUs, which comprise 25% of the total 2018 annual award, provide a retention incentive and vest in three equal annual installments on February 20th in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
Vesting of Performance Awards Previously Granted.    The Company's December 31, 2018 per share book value was $43.32 and one-third of each of the February 21, 2017 and February 24, 2016 Book Value RSUs vested. The underlying shares were released and issued in accordance with their terms on February 21, 2019. On February 21, 2019, 26% of TSR RSUs that were granted on February 24, 2016 were released as the Company's percentile ranking within the S&P MidCap 400 Index at the end of the three-year performance period on December 31, 2018 was 33%. Our NEOs received a below-target payout of their TSR RSUs, which we believe demonstrates the performance-based nature of our TSR RSU design. 
Other Compensation 
Retirement Programs.    We maintain a 401(k) savings plan for our employees and, under the terms of the plan, will make matching contributions in amounts equal to 116% of up to 6% of the contributions made by each NEO. 
Benefits and Perquisites.    Our NEOs generally receive the same healthcare benefits as our other employees. We pay Mr. Plueger's premiums for a $2.0 million term life insurance policy payable to his beneficiaries and we pay Mr. Udvar-Házy's premiums for a $5.0 million term life insurance policy payable to his beneficiaries. In addition, we pay the premiums for Messrs. Plueger, Udvar-Házy, Chen, Levy and Willis under our group term life insurance program, in which all of our employees participate.

Personal Use of Company Aircraft.    The Board of Directors adopted a travel policy that requires the Chief Executive Officer and President and the Executive Chairman to use, to the maximum extent practicable, Company-owned aircraft for personal use as well as business travel. In 2018, the incremental cost of Messrs. Plueger's and Udvar-Házy's personal use of Company aircraft was approximately $73,909 and $40,524, respectively. 
Executive Severance Plan 
Under the Air Lease Corporation Executive Severance Plan effective as of February 21, 2017, as amended, Company employees who are vice presidents and above, who are designated by the compensation committee (or persons appointed by the compensation committee) and who are not party to an individual severance agreement ("Covered Employees") would generally be entitled to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan. The compensation committee has designated our executive and senior vice presidents as participants. The Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company are not participants because they are each a party to individual severance agreements. The severance benefits are generally conditioned upon execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with non-competition, confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions as set forth in the Severance Plan. 
2019 Executive Compensation Program 
The same key elements of our executive compensation program are applicable in 2019. As described above, in determining 2019 target compensation, the compensation committee considered, among other things, data from the S&P MidCap 400 and the Custom Benchmark Group, and then compared the proposed 2019 compensation to 2018 target compensation for each NEO. Specifically, the compensation committee analyzed base salary, actual bonus paid, long-term incentive and total compensation. The compensation committee compared each element of the Company's compensation and total compensation to that of the Custom Benchmark Group and the S&P MidCap 400 relative to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile. The compensation committee also reviewed the mix of pay and compared that to the Custom Benchmark Group and S&P MidCap 400. Consideration of this analysis was critical to the compensation committee's 2019 actions. 
Annual Compensation 
Base Salary.    The 2019 base salaries for Messrs. Plueger, Udvar-Házy, Chen and Levy did not change. The 2019 base salary for Mr. Willis increased from $630,000 to $650,000. In determining our NEO's base salaries, the compensation committee considered the market information described above. 
Performance-Based Annual Incentives.    Subject to the achievement of key business results for 2019, we plan to pay performance-based annual incentives for 2019 to recognize individuals based on their contributions to those results. The compensation committee developed the following 2019 performance-based guidelines for the payment of annual incentive awards to our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Equity           40%      
 Strategic Objective – Cumulative Placement of Aircraft Through 2022           20%      
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  45 
As in 2018, Mr. Udvar-Házy's 2019 annual incentive will be paid in a stock bonus award in the form of RSUs that have a grant date value equal to the amount of his incentive earned for 2019 performance, and will cliff vest two years from the date of grant, which will not occur until the amount of the annual bonus is determined in 2020. As a result, Mr. Udvar-Házy's annual incentive will not be paid in cash. We believe denominating our Executive Chairman's annual bonus in stock and effectively requiring a three-year vesting period further aligns our Executive Chairman's compensation with stockholders' long-term interests. 
In previous years, the compensation committee has included several strategic goals. For 2019, the compensation committee determined that cumulative placement of aircraft should be management's focus because as of December 31, 2018, we had commitments to purchase 372 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus for delivery through 2024, with an estimated aggregate commitment of $26.3 billion. 
New Annual Cash Bonus Plan.    2019 annual incentives will become earned under the terms of our new Annual Cash Bonus Plan. We adopted the Annual Cash Bonus Plan to replace the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan. The 2013 Cash Bonus Plan contained many provisions that are no longer applicable following the 2017 amendments to Section 162(m) of the Code. The Annual Cash Bonus Plan contains many of the same features as the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan and is intended to provide the framework for our performance-based annual incentives going forward. All of the NEOs and our other officers are eligible to participate in the Annual Cash Bonus Plan. Like under the 2013 Cash Bonus Plan, the compensation committee will generally establish the applicable performance measures within the first 90 days of each calendar year. Similarly, the compensation committee will retain the discretion to reduce any NEO's incentive award otherwise becoming payable on any basis it deems appropriate (such as its assessment of the Company's performance or the NEO's individual performance). 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
We made long-term equity incentive awards to each of our NEOs (the "2019 Awards") under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. These long-term equity incentive awards were in the form of Book Value and TSR RSU performance awards and Time-based RSU awards. 
The compensation committee continues to believe that a mix of Book Value RSUs and TSR RSUs with an increased weighting of Book Value RSUs relative to TSR RSUs, creates a balanced performance-based incentive. The compensation committee believes that such a mix which incentivizes the executives to grow our long-term book value per share in a capital-intensive business like ours will lead to value creation for stockholders and create a mix of incentives that will drive long-term performance. 
The Book Value RSUs, which comprise 50% of the total 2019 Award, provide the executives with the incentive to increase the book value of the Company. The degree to which the 2019 Book Value RSUs will vest will depend on whether the Company, over a three-year performance period, meets the book value performance measure. The compensation committee reset the beginning per share book value for the 2019 Book Value RSUs grants to the actual book value per share on December 31, 2018 so that the Company's per share book value must increase from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021 for the shares to vest at the end of the three-year performance period. As with Book-Value RSUs granted in 2018, the 2019 Book Value RSUs cliff vest at the end of three years instead of being eligible to vest annually over a period of three years. Because the Company is a capital-intensive business (acquiring and leasing commercial aircraft), the book value, which is the Company's assets minus its liabilities, is an important measure of the Company's value. 
The TSR RSUs, which comprise 25% of the total 2019 Award, provide an incentive for the executives during the same three-year performance period to seek an overall increase in TSR. 
46  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
The Time-based RSUs, which comprise 25% of the total 2019 Award, provide a retention incentive and vest in three equal annual installments on February 20th in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Employment Agreements and Arrangements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Other Employment Arrangements 
In connection with Mr. Udvar-Házy becoming our Executive Chairman and Mr. Plueger becoming our Chief Executive Officer and President, the Company entered into Severance Agreements with each of these officers, effective July 1, 2016. As described in the discussion and tables below, Messrs. Udvar-Házy's and Plueger's Severance Agreements and the Executive Severance Plan that became effective February 22, 2017, as amended, provide for payments and other benefits to our NEOs if their employment with us is terminated under certain circumstances, including following a change in control. Certain of our employee benefits plans, including our Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and our NEOs' award agreements under each of the plans, also provide for such benefits. Although an employee is entitled to severance benefits under any applicable Company agreement, an employee's benefit under the Executive Severance Plan will be reduced by any other severance or termination payments received; currently the Executive Severance Plan provides the maximum severance or termination payments to be received. 
Severance Agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Executive Chairman 
Severance Agreement with each of Mr. Plueger and Mr. Udvar-Házy.    The Severance Agreements between our Company and Mr. Plueger and Mr. Udvar-Házy were effective as of July 1, 2016, and terminate on the third anniversary of the effective date, July 1, 2019, (the "Term"), subject to automatic 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  53 
 additional one-year extensions, unless terminated by either party with at least 90 days' notice. The terms of each of Mr. Plueger's and Mr. Udvar-Házy's Severance Agreements are substantially the same and, except with respect to the equity award provisions described below, each of the Severance Agreements provide for severance benefits that are substantially similar to the severance benefits previously provided for in each of Messrs. Udvar-Házy's and Plueger's employment agreements. 
Termination Provisions under the Severance Agreements.    The terms of each of Mr. Plueger's and Mr. Udvar-Házy's Severance Agreements relating to termination of employment are described below: 
(i)    Termination without Cause or by the executive for Good Reason Other Than within 24 months of a Change in Control.    If the executive's employment is terminated by us without Cause or by the executive for Good Reason (other than within 24 months of a change in control), as defined in his Severance Agreement and described below, he will be entitled to receive, subject in certain circumstances to delivering certain releases and/or agreements, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued but unpaid salary and benefits, expense reimbursement, and any earned but unpaid annual bonus with respect to the  last calendar year completed during his employment;  
• a prorated annual bonus with respect to the calendar year in which such termination occurs based on actual Company  performance;  
• salary continuation, continued health coverage, and continued payment by us of the premiums for his group term life  insurance policy until the second anniversary of the date of such termination;  
• two times the average of the annual bonus payments received during the thirty-six-month period immediately prior to his date of termination, payable in substantially equal installments over the two-year period following the termination of  his employment; and  
• pro rata vesting based on actual Company performance for any then current performance periods for performance-based equity  awards granted during the Term of the Severance Agreement.  
[END TABLE]
(ii)    Termination without Cause or by executive for Good Reason within 24 months of a Change in Control.    If the termination described above is within 24 months of a Change in Control, as defined under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and any successor plan, subject in certain circumstances to delivering certain releases and/or agreements, he will be entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued but unpaid salary and benefits, expense reimbursement, and any earned but unpaid annual bonus with respect to the  last calendar year completed during his employment;

• a lump sum cash payment representing the costs of providing benefits under the group health plans in which he was  participating at the time of termination of employment for a period of two years;  
• a lump sum cash payment of the premiums for his group term life insurance for a period of two years;  
• full vesting at target level of performance for performance-based equity awards granted during the Term of the Severance  Agreement; and  
• if any of the executive's benefits are parachute payments, the executive will be entitled to (a) his benefits  reduced so that no portion of such benefits is subject to excise tax or (b) his benefits without any such reduction, whichever is greater on an after-tax-basis.  
[END TABLE]
(iii)    Termination due to disability or death.    If the executive's employment is terminated due to disability or death, he, his estate or his beneficiaries will be entitled to receive accrued but unpaid salary and 
54  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement benefits, expense reimbursement, and any earned but unpaid annual bonus with respect to the last calendar year completed during his employment. In addition, he will be entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a prorated annual bonus with respect to the calendar year in which such termination occurs; and  
• continued vesting based on actual Company performance for performance-based equity awards granted during the Term of the  Severance Agreement.  
[END TABLE]
(iv)    Termination for Cause or by executive without Good Reason.    If the executive's employment is terminated for cause, or he terminates his employment without Good Reason, he will be entitled to receive accrued but unpaid salary and benefits, expense reimbursement, and any earned but unpaid annual bonus with respect to the last calendar year completed during his employment. 
"Cause" is defined for the purposes of each Severance Agreement as (i) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or a crime of moral turpitude; (ii) willful fraud, misappropriation, dishonesty or embezzlement, having a material adverse financial, economic or reputational effect on the Company; (iii) willful misconduct or gross or willful neglect in the performance of duties; or (iv) breach in any material respect of the terms and provisions of the Severance Agreement. The Severance Agreement provides that in the event of termination of the executive's employment pursuant to clauses (iii) or (iv), the Company shall provide the executive with a notice of termination not more than 30 days following the occurrence of such event (or if later, the Company's actual knowledge of such event). The executive may not be terminated for "Cause" unless such termination is approved by a vote of the majority of the entire Board of Directors (or such other vote required pursuant to the by-laws of the Company) at a meeting duly called and held at which the executive has the right to be present and be heard. 
"Good Reason" under each Severance Agreement includes (i) the material reduction of the executive's authority, duties and responsibilities, or the assignment to him of duties materially inconsistent with his position or positions with our Company or the failure to report directly to the Board of Directors; (ii) a reduction in his then current annual salary; or (iii) the relocation of his office more than 35 miles from his then current office location. The executive must provide us with notice and a 30-day cure period, and if cured, the event or condition at issue will not constitute "Good Reason". 
The executive will have no obligation to mitigate damages in the event of a termination of his employment, and no payments under his Severance Agreement will be subject to offset in the event that the executive does mitigate. 
Equity Award Arrangements 
Mr. Plueger was granted a Promotional RSU in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and President which vests on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided however if Mr. Plueger's employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the award agreement), or if his employment is terminated by reason of death or disability prior to vesting, the Promotional RSU will vest in full. 
Messrs. Plueger and Udvar-Házy were each granted a Time-based RSU in the 2018 annual equity grant which vests in three equal annual installments on February 20th in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021; provided however, if either of their employment is terminated prior to vesting (i) without Cause or for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the award agreement) within twenty-four months of a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the award agreement) or if their employment is terminated by reason of death or Disability (as such term is defined in the award agreement), the RSU will immediately vest in full or (ii) without Cause or for Good Reason outside of twenty-four months of a Change in Control prior to vesting, the RSU will prorata vest through the date of termination. 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  55 
As previously discussed under Performance-Based Annual Cash Incentives—Elements of the Executive Compensation Program, Mr. Udvar-Házy was granted on February 20, 2019, a stock bonus award in the form of time-based RSUs ("Bonus RSUs") in lieu of his 2018 annual cash incentive, with a value on the grant date equal to the dollar amount of his cash incentive earned in 2018. These Bonus RSUs will cliff vest (100%) on the second anniversary of the date of grant, provided however, if Mr. Udvar-Házy's employment is terminated prior to vesting (i) (a) without Cause or for Good Reason within twenty-four months of a Change in Control or (b) by reason of death or Disability or (c) by reason of retirement as approved by the compensation committee, in writing, the RSU will immediately vest in full or (ii) without Cause or for Good Reason other than within twenty-four months of a Change in Control prior to vesting, the RSU will prorata vest through the date of termination. All capitalized terms are defined in the award agreement. 
Executive Severance Plan 
On February 21, 2017, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the compensation committee, approved and adopted the Air Lease Corporation Executive Severance Plan ("Severance Plan"), effective as of February 22, 2017. The Severance Plan replaces the Company's non-binding severance guidelines concerning severance and other benefits for executives who are vice-presidents and above as described below. Under the Severance Plan, Company employees who are vice presidents and above, who are designated by the compensation committee (or persons appointed by the compensation committee) and who are not party to an individual severance agreement ("Covered Employees") would generally be entitled to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan. The compensation committee has designated our executive and senior vice presidents as participants. The Chief Executive Officer and President and the Executive Chairman are not participants because they are each a party to individual severance agreements. The severance benefits are generally conditioned upon execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with non-competition, confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions as set forth in the Severance Plan. 
Termination without Cause by the Company Other Than within Twenty-Four Months of a Change in Control.    If a Covered Employee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, as defined in the Severance Plan, other than within twenty-four months of a Change in Control, as defined under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the Covered Employee will be entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued but unpaid salary and benefits, expense reimbursement, and any earned but unpaid annual bonus with respect to the  last calendar year completed during his or her employment ("Accrued Benefits");  
• a prorated annual bonus with respect to the calendar year in which such termination occurs based on actual performance;   
• immediate prorata vesting of any outstanding deferred bonus awards granted under the Company's Amended and Restated  Deferred Bonus Plan ("Deferred Bonus Plan");  
• an amount equal to the sum of the Covered Employee's (x) annual salary in effect as of the date of termination  and (y) the average of the annual bonus payments received during the thirty-six month period immediately prior to the Covered Employee's date of termination, multiplied by a multiplier of 1x for  executive vice presidents and by a multiplier of .5x for senior vice presidents, payable in substantially equal installments over one year from the date of termination for executive officers and six months from the date of termination for senior  vice presidents;  
• continued health coverage until one year from the date of termination for executive vice presidents and six months from the  date of termination for senior vice presidents;  
• pro rata vesting based on actual Company performance for any then current performance periods for outstanding  performance-based equity awards; and  
• pro rata vesting through date of termination for outstanding time-based equity awards.

[BEGIN TABLE]

• a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the COBRA costs of providing benefits under the group health plans in which  the Covered Employee was participating at the time of termination of employment for two years for executive vice presidents and one year for senior vice presidents;

The Board may amend, modify or terminate the Severance Plan at any time in its sole and exclusive discretion subject to certain limitations.

Certain of the amounts identified below are only estimates. Some amounts in the tables and footnotes have been rounded up to the nearest whole number. 
Under the terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, a change in control generally means the first to occur of the following: (i) an acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of 35% or more, on a fully diluted basis, of our outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, excluding any acquisition by the Company or any affiliate, any acquisition directly from the Company, any acquisition by any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any affiliate or any acquisition that complies with clauses (A), (B), and (C) of clause (iv); (ii) individuals who were members of our Board on the effective date, and directors whose election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of such incumbent directors, cease to constitute at least a majority of our board; (iii) our complete dissolution or liquidation; or (iv) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share

 exchange, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or similar form of corporate transaction that requires the approval of our stockholders, unless immediately following any such transaction, (A) the majority of the total voting power of the surviving company (or parent corporation with voting power to elect a majority of the directors of the surviving company) is represented by our outstanding voting securities that were outstanding before the transaction and held by the holders thereof in substantially the same proportion as before the transaction, (B) no person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 35% or more of the total voting power of the parent company or, absent a parent company, the surviving company, and (C) at least two-thirds of the directors of the parent company (or surviving company) following such transaction were members of our board at the time of the board approval for such transaction. 
Regardless of the termination scenario, each of our NEOs will receive earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination of his employment.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
The 2018 annual total compensation of the Company's CEO was $7,672,190. The 2018 annual total compensation of the median employee (excluding the CEO) was $189,642. The ratio between the two amounts is 41:1. 
The Company believes that the ratio of pay included above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with applicable SEC rules. 
To determine the pay ratio, we took the following steps: For 2018 we identified the median employee using our employee population consisting of 97 employees on December 31, 2018. We identified the median employee based on gross wages paid in 2018 as reported on form W-2. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to gross wages paid in 2018. 
As required by SEC rules, after identifying our median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for both our median employee and our CEO using the same methodology that we used to determine our NEOs' annual compensation for the Summary Compensation Table. This information is being provided for compliance purposes. Neither the compensation committee nor management of the Company used the pay ratio measure in making compensation decisions. Given the different methodologies that companies use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.

The policy contemplates that our Chief Financial Officer, or his designee, will provide a quarterly report to the audit committee listing services performed by and fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm during the current fiscal year and the previous quarter, including a reconciliation of the actual fees of the independent auditors compared to the budget for such services as approved by the audit committee.

General Information 
When and where is the Annual Meeting being held? 
The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2019 at 7:30 a.m., Pacific Time, at Century Plaza Towers, 2029 Century Park East, Concourse Level, Conference Room A, Los Angeles, California 90067. 
What is the purpose of this Proxy Statement? 
The Board of Directors is providing you with this Proxy Statement to solicit your voting proxy for the Annual Meeting. It provides you with information to help you decide how you want your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement and the Notice of Annual Meeting are first being made available to stockholders on or about March 29, 2019. 
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials in the mail? 
We have elected to provide certain of our stockholders of record access to our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report, on the internet as provided for in our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (a "Notice") instead of sending a full set of printed proxy materials. Brokers, banks and other nominees who hold shares on behalf of beneficial owners will be sending their own similar Notice to the beneficial owners. If you receive a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request it. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice also instructs you on how you may vote over the internet or by telephone or mail. If you receive a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. If you request printed materials by mail, these printed proxy materials also include the voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting. 
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting? 
For stockholders to take action at the Annual Meeting, a majority of the shares of our Class A Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present or represented at the Annual Meeting. This 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  65 
 is called a quorum. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present if (a) you are entitled to vote and you are present at the Annual Meeting or (b) you have properly voted by proxy online, by phone or by submitting a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. 
Who may vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Stockholders of record of the 111,118,169 shares of our Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding at the close of business on March 12, 2019, which is the record date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to one vote on each matter voted upon at the Annual Meeting for each share held. In addition to stockholders of record of our Class A Common Stock, "beneficial owners of shares held in street name" as of the record date can vote using the methods described below under "How do I cast my vote?" There is no cumulative voting. 
What is the difference between a "stockholder of record" and a "beneficial owner of shares held in street name"? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered a "stockholder of record" of the shares with respect to those shares, and the proxy materials were made available directly to you by the Company. 
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, a bank or other similar organization or by another holder of record, then you are considered the "beneficial owner" of the shares, and the shares are considered to be held in "street name". As a beneficial owner, the proxy materials were made available to you by the organization holding your shares and you have the right to instruct your broker, bank, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares. 
How do I cast my vote? 
Stockholders of record may vote (i) by filling out and signing the proxy card that was included with this Proxy Statement and returning it in the envelope provided, (ii) by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card, or (iii) online at the internet voting website provided on the proxy card. Stockholders of record may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares. If you received printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may also vote by filling out the voting instruction form and returning it in the envelope provided. The availability of online or phone voting may depend on the voting process of the organization that holds your shares. Beneficial owners who want to attend and also vote in person at the Annual Meeting will need to obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds their shares giving them the right to vote their shares in person at the Annual Meeting and present it with their ballot. 
How can I change my vote? 
Stockholders of record can revoke and change a prior proxy vote by submitting a later-dated proxy online, by phone or by mail or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders of record may also send a letter to our Secretary at the address for our principal executive office listed on the cover page of this Proxy Statement so that it arrives no later than the close of business on May 7, 2019. Only your latest proxy card or voting instruction form received in accordance with the requirements above will be counted. Your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself revoke your proxy. If you are a beneficial owner, you will need to contact the organization that holds your shares to obtain instructions on how to change your vote. 
Who are the proxies? 
The named proxies for the Annual Meeting are Carol H. Forsyte, John L. Plueger and Steven F. Udvar-Házy and they will follow all properly submitted voting instructions. 
66  |  Air Lease Corporation  |  2019 Proxy Statement 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
If you are a stockholder of record and do not direct on a properly submitted proxy how your shares are to be voted on any item of business, the proxies named above will vote your shares on those items of business as the Board of Directors recommends and will vote in their judgment on any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting. We do not know of any other business that may come before the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then the organization that holds your shares may generally vote your shares in their discretion on "routine matters" but cannot vote your shares on "non-routine" matters. Proposal 2 (ratification of appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. All other proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are considered "non-routine." Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may exercise its discretion to vote on Proposal 2 at the Annual Meeting, but will not be permitted to vote your shares on any of the other proposals at the Annual Meeting. See below under "What is a broker non-vote?" for additional information. 
What is a broker non-vote? 
A broker non-vote occurs when an organization that holds the shares of a beneficial owner does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner on how to vote the shares on a non-routine matter at the Annual Meeting and the organization does not have discretionary authority under applicable rules to vote on such proposals. At the Annual Meeting, we understand that organizations have discretionary authority to vote only on Proposal 2 (ratification of appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm). If your broker exercises this discretion, your shares will be voted on Proposal 2 in the manner directed by your broker, but your shares will constitute "broker non-votes" on each of the other items at the Annual Meeting. 
What are the votes required to approve the proposals? 
Election of Directors.    A director nominee will be elected to the Board of Directors by a majority of the votes cast, meaning the votes cast "FOR" such nominee's election must exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" such nominee's election at the Annual Meeting pursuant to the Company's bylaws. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the director election because they are not treated as votes cast. 
Ratification of Appointment of KPMG as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. 
Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation.    With regard to the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the Annual Meeting will be required for the advisory approval. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory vote. The results of this vote are not binding on the Board of Directors. 
Are there any dissenters' rights available? 
There are no rights of appraisal or other rights of dissenters with respect to any matter to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
Who is paying the costs of soliciting proxies? 
The Company is paying the costs of soliciting proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors. In addition to this Proxy Statement, our officers, directors and other employees may solicit proxies personally or in 
2019 Proxy Statement   |  Air Lease Corporation  |  67 
 writing or by telephone for no additional compensation. We will, if requested, reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians and nominees for their reasonable expenses in providing these materials to their beneficial holders. We have hired D.F. King & Co., Inc., a professional advisory firm, to assist us in proxy solicitation. We will pay D.F. King & Co., Inc. $11,500 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. 
Who will serve as the inspector of the election? 
We have engaged First Coast Results, Inc. to count the votes and act as an independent inspector of the election. 
How can I obtain directions to be able to attend the meeting and vote in person? 
You may request directions to the location of the Annual Meeting by sending a letter to our Secretary at the address for our principal executive office listed on the cover page of this Proxy Statement.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Based solely on written representations furnished to us from reporting persons and our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and any amendments thereto furnished to us, we believe all such Forms required to be filed during 2018 under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, were filed on a timely basis. 
Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
To be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, we must receive no later than November 30, 2019 any stockholder proposal that a stockholder intends to be presented at the meeting. 
Under our bylaws, written notice of nominations to the Board of Directors and any other business proposed by a stockholder of record that is not to be included in the proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by the Secretary at our principal executive office not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of this year's Annual Meeting (so long as the 2020 annual meeting is held no more than 30 days before and no more than 70 days after such anniversary). Accordingly, notice of any such nominations or other business meeting all of the requirements set forth in our bylaws must be received by the Secretary between January 9, 2020 and February 8, 2020. The Chairman of the Annual Meeting reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with our bylaws and other applicable requirements, including conditions established by the SEC. SEC rules permit the Company's management to vote proxies in its discretion with respect to such matters if we advise stockholders how management intends to vote. 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering in a single envelope all of the Notices or a single copy of the proxy statement and annual report addressed to those security holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies. 
Brokers with accountholders who are the Company's stockholders may be "householding" our proxy materials. As a result, all of the Notices or a single copy of the proxy statement and annual report may be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Notice or copy of the proxy statement and annual report, please notify your broker or notify us by writing to our principal executive offices at 2000 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1000N Los Angeles, CA 90067, Attn: Corporate Secretary or by telephone at 1-310-553-0555. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notices or copies of the proxy statement and annual report at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker.
