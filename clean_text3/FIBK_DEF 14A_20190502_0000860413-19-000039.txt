To Our Shareholders,
If one word were to define our focus at First Interstate Bank, it would be: "relevancy." In this digital and technological era, it is essential that relevancy remain front of mind as we define our purpose, consider our actions, and measure our results. From top to bottom and across all six states within our footprint, remaining relevant as a financial institution will be central to our strategy, to our efforts to serve our clients and communities, and ultimately to our success.
Looking back on 2018-and to the start of my tenure as President and CEO in 2015-remaining a relevant, growing company has been instrumental in pursuing First Interstate's vision. Every day, we strive to be the premier financial services provider within the communities we serve.  This means we are continuously focused on delivering products and processes that make our interactions more effective, efficient, and effortless.  We believe that this will strengthen our relationships with our employees, our clients, and our communities, all while driving long-term shareholder value. We are accomplishing this by remaining laser-focused on three areas:  our people, our processes, and our technology.  
Our people are-and always will be-our most valuable asset. We take care of our employees and firmly believe that happy, engaged employees will pay dividends going forward.   In 2018, we continued to invest in our people by enhancing our benefits, our training opportunities, and our communications at all levels to ensure our teams are aligned with our vision, mission, and values. We strengthened our executive team and instituted a senior leadership team.  These two groups of leaders are diverse in gender, experience, and capabilities.  They are a collaborative, cohesive team; the next generation of bankers poised to lead First Interstate forward.
Over the past year, we continued to enhance bank-wide systems and processes to ensure continued delivery of quality products and services to our clients while removing friction from the interaction. Through initiatives like our loan transformation process, we are streamlining workflows that will better serve our employees and our clients.  We are nearing the culmination of our core transformation initiative, a comprehensive project that will allow us to better understand our clients in order to deliver the quality products and services they need.  And we are upgrading our accounting and reporting systems, which will allow us to better measure and report on our progress.  
We continued to invest in technology, implementing forward-looking solutions that will enable First Interstate to be on the leading-edge in adapting to-and adopting-inevitable changes in the industry. We are building an integration layer that will improve our capabilities to "plug and play" the platforms through which clients want to interact with us, now and well into the future.  We are expanding our digital initiatives, delivering products and services to our clients in the manner in which they want to conduct business. From our highly-rated app to online mortgage, credit card, and small business applications to guided wealth management, we are investing in efficient delivery systems that meet our clients' needs.
While investing in our people, processes and technology, we continue to consider strategic opportunities for growth through acquisitions. With the guiding principle that "bigger is not better, better is better," we evaluate candidates based on their potential to enhance franchise value. 
Last year we completed the acquisition of Inland Northwest Bank based in Spokane, Washington, and announced the pending acquisitions of northern Idaho-based Idaho Independent Bank and Community 1st Bank. Once these two acquisitions close, First Interstate will rank sixth in market share in Idaho, providing us with a position of strength in this market. All three banks are financially, strategically, geographically, and culturally compatible with First Interstate and our growth objectives.
In addition to contributing to our solid deposit base and strengthening our organic growth profile, all three of these community banks are committed to the people and places they serve. With our expanded footprint in northern Idaho and eastern Washington, we are excited to be able to elevate the ways we give back to these communities through financial and volunteer support.
While the financial industry may be ever-evolving, there are 12 guiding principles by which we lead this company that will withstand the test of time.  They encompass the execution of our annual operating plans; financial goals, including earnings per share growth and return on equity metrics to be in the top tier of financial institutions; employee goals, relating to engaged leadership and employees; client goals, measuring loyalty and satisfaction; risk goals, including regulatory metrics, balance sheet management and risk management culture; and strategic goals, addressing our ability to remain relevant, focused on our community banking model, and effectively communicating to all of our stakeholders while remaining unwaveringly committed to our vision, mission, and values.
The future for banking is rife with uncertainty:  the war for deposits, an uncertain interest rate environment, global trade wars, tariffs, the next industry disruptor, and changing consumer preferences. Because we cannot look to the environment to provide clarity, we must do so from within. Our 12 guiding principles-the framework in which we make decisions-will help forge a clear path toward increased future financial success.
Whatever the environment ahead, we are confident that we have built a solid foundation that will provide the flexibility needed to weather any storm. We manage with an eye toward risk, taking a conservative approach to deploying capital and being highly selective in acquisitions. Additionally, we are focused on growing not only our loan portfolio, but a solid base of deposits, which is critical to long-term success.  
As we celebrate the 50th year of being a community bank, we believe we are putting the people, processes and technology to work that will allow us to remain a relevant, vibrant, profitable company committed to our people, our clients, our communities, and our shareholders for many years to come.
I am proud of the First Interstate team and its dedication and progress toward achieving our vision this past year. I look forward to leading it to greater successes in 2019.
Sincerely,
Kevin P. Riley

2018 Performance 
[END TABLE]
2018 was a strong year for First Interstate Bank. We had earnings per common share of $2.75, which was a 34% increase over the prior year.  Expansion in our net interest margin and the benefit of tax reform were the primary drivers behind our results.  Building upon our initial entrance into the Northwest United States last year, in April, we announced the agreement to acquire Northwest Bancorporation, Inc., the parent company of Inland Northwest Bank, an $826 million Washington-based community bank with 20 banking offices across Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. The acquisition closed in August and we successfully completed the integration in November. In addition, in October, we signed definitive agreements to acquire two Idaho-based banks: Idaho Independent Bank, a $725 million community bank based in Coeur d'Alene, ID; and Community 1st Bank, a $130 million community bank based in Post Falls, ID. These three acquisitions complement our franchise and provide us with meaningful market share in attractive, high growth markets in Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho.  As a result of higher earnings, we were also able to increase our quarterly dividend by 16.7%, to $0.28 per common share.  
As we progressed through 2018, we continued to focus on people, process, and technology as we sought to deliver to each of our stakeholders in meaningful and compelling ways …
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For our employees … As our most valuable asset, we continued to strengthen our employee benefit package, provide greater training opportunities and improve Company-wide, interactive communications in order to support a healthy work environment. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For our clients … We continued to invest in our digital platform and strengthen our business processes in order to deliver quality products and services to our clients when and where they choose to interact with us. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For our communities … Commitment to our communities is at the core of our DNA and we continued to give back both financially and through employee volunteerism. In 2018 we celebrated our 50th anniversary with a Company-wide volunteer day to assist those less fortunate across our footprint. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For our shareholders … We believe engaged employees, satisfied clients, and strong communities have a significant impact to our financial results, which ultimately allows us to meet the expectations of our shareholders.  2018 reported higher levels of return on average equity, average assets, and an expanded net interest margin. Full year earnings of $160.2 million, or $2.75 per diluted share, included merger related costs of $12.4 million, which impacted earnings per share by $0.17.

PROPOSAL ONE - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
At the end of fiscal year 2018, there were fifteen directors serving on the Board. The tenures of two directors who are not seeking re-election at the annual meeting, Jonathan R. Scott and William B. Ebzery, will end on May 2, 2019. A total of two directors, one of which is a current member of the Board, will be elected at the annual meeting to serve three-year terms, or until their respective successors have been elected and appointed. After the annual meeting, the Board will have fourteen directors divided into three groups with staggered three-year terms. The Board has nominated for election as directors at this annual meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• James R. Scott, Jr. 
• Randall I. Scott 
[END TABLE]
James R. Scott, Jr. is a current member of the Board. Randall I. Scott is not a current member of the Board.
Unless authority to vote is withheld, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote the shares represented by such proxy for the election of the nominees named above. If, at the time of the annual meeting, any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason for election as a director, the persons entitled to vote the proxy will vote for the election of such substitute(s) as the Board may recommend. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why any nominee might be unavailable to serve. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Nominees 
[END TABLE]
The following tables set forth information regarding the nominees for election at the annual meeting and the directors continuing in office after the annual meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name and Age   Director Since   Principal Occupation 
James R. Scott, Jr., 41   2016   Commercial Loan Manager, First Interstate Bank, Medford 
Randall I. Scott, 65   N/A (1)   Managing General Partner, Nbar5 Limited Partnership 
[END TABLE]
(1) Due to term limits that require certain Scott family members to have at least a one-year break in service after serving two consecutive three-year terms, Randall I. Scott's most recent term ended in May of 2018. Mr. Scott first became a director of the Company in 1993.
If a quorum is present at the annual meeting, a plurality of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting are needed to elect a director. This means that the two nominees for director who receive the most affirmative votes for their election will be elected for a three year term.  
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" each of the nominees named above.  
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL TWO - RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
[END TABLE]
RSM US LLP was appointed by the Audit Committee of the Board as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. While the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has requested that the Board submit the selection of RSM US LLP to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. No representatives of RSM US LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting. 
Neither the Audit Committee nor the Board is required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, if our shareholders do not ratify the selection of RSM US LLP as the selected independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee will consider whether to retain RSM US LLP or to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. 
Proxies solicited hereby will be voted for the proposal unless a vote against the proposal or abstention is specifically indicated. If a quorum is present at the annual meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting are needed to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. This means that the appointment of RSM US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company will be ratified if more than 50% of the votes present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting are cast by shareholders in favor of ratification. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" ratifying the appointment of  RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL THREE - APPROVAL OF CHARTER AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE FOR MAJORITY VOTING IN THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Under the Montana Business Corporation Act, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The Board, based upon the recommendation of its Governance & Nominating Committee and other factors, has determined it to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to memorialize in the Company's articles of incorporation the adoption of a majority voting standard in the election of directors to complement the Company's existing corporate governance policies and to further the Company's efforts in enhancing its corporate governance practices. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Board has approved for shareholder consideration at this meeting an amendment to Section 5 of Article VI of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which amendment would include a new second sentence thereto that would read in its entirety as follows:
Directors shall be elected by a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at an annual meeting of shareholders and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
The Board believes that the proposed amendment will encourage active shareholder participation in the election of directors and enhance the Company's existing corporate governance policies and practices. It is possible, however, that the proposed amendment could have the effect of making the election of a director more difficult in a contested election. The proposed change to a more rigorous majority voting standard is not, however, being proposed for the purpose of making a contested director election more difficult or in response to any known efforts by any person to propose a director nominee for election to the Board.
If the amendment is approved by the shareholders, the amendment will become effective upon the filing of the appropriate amendment documentation with the Montana Secretary of State. The Company intends to make any such authorized filing promptly following the annual meeting, and in any event such that the majority voting standard as so adopted in the Company's articles of incorporation would be applicable to the election of directors at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders.
Proxies solicited hereby will be voted for the proposal unless a vote against the proposal or abstention or non-vote is specifically indicated. If a quorum is present at the meeting, this proposal will be approved if the votes cast at the meeting by the shareholders, favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast by shareholders opposing the proposal. This means that the amendment to the charter will be approved if more than 50% of the votes present in person or by proxy that are cast by shareholders at the annual meeting, without regard to abstentions or non-votes, are cast "for" this proposal.
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the charter amendment to provide for majority voting in the election of directors.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL FOUR - APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE ANNUAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES FOR THE FOREGOING PROPOSALS 
[END TABLE]
We are asking our shareholders to vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies for the foregoing proposals.
As discussed above, our Board recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the Director nominees, FOR the ratification of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and FOR the Charter amendment to provide for majority voting in the election of directors. If there are insufficient proxies at the time of the annual meeting to approve any of the foregoing proposals the Company shareholders may be asked to vote on this proposal to adjourn this annual meeting to a later date to allow additional time to solicit additional proxies. The Board does not currently intend to propose adjournment at the annual meeting if there are sufficient votes to approve the foregoing matters. 
Proxies solicited hereby will be voted for the proposal unless a vote against the proposal or abstention or non-vote is specifically indicated. If a quorum is present at the meeting, this proposal will be approved by the shareholders if a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter cast their votes in favor of the adjournment. This means that the adjournment will be approved if more than 50% of the votes present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote are cast by shareholders "for" this proposal.
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval to adjourn the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies for the foregoing proposals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL FIVE - ADOPTION OF NON-BINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
Section 14A of the Exchange Act provides shareholders an opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of the "named executive officers" identified in the Summary Compensation Table included on page 37 of this document.
The Company's general compensation philosophy is that executive compensation should align with shareholders' interests without encouraging excessive or unnecessary risk.  First Interstate executive compensation programs, which are described in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this document beginning on page 27, are designed to attract and retain qualified executive officers and establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and First Interstate's annual financial performance and long-term growth objectives.  Long-term executive compensation, through awards of restricted First Interstate Class A common stock containing time- and performance-based vesting provisions, encourages growth in executive stock ownership and helps drive performance that rewards both executives and shareholders.
The advisory vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of executive compensation; rather, the advisory vote relates to the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this document in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") compensation disclosure rules.  The vote is advisory only, which means that it is not binding on the Company, its Board, or the Compensation Committee of the Board.  The Company's Board and its Compensation Committee value the opinions of shareholders and therefore will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
Accordingly, the shareholders are requested to vote on the following resolution at the Company's annual meeting of shareholders:
RESOLVED, that the First Interstate shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this document pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion of this document, the Summary Compensation Table included in this document, and the other related tables and disclosures included in this document.
Proxies solicited hereby will be voted for the proposal unless a vote against the proposal or abstention or non-vote is specifically indicated. If a quorum is present at the annual meeting, we will consider the non-binding, advisory approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers to have occurred if the vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on this matter is voted for the resolution. This means that the approval will be obtained if more than 50% of the votes present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting are cast by shareholders "for" this proposal.
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this document. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 1, 2019 for (i) each of our directors and director nominees, (ii) each of the executive officers named in the summary compensation table, (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group, and (iv) beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of our common stock. 
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. 
Percentage of class beneficially owned as of March 1, 2019 is based on 38,281,996 shares of Class A common stock and 22,394,860 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed shares of each class of common stock subject to options held by that person that were exercisable on or within 60 days of March 1, 2019 to be outstanding. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.  In computing the number of shares of Class A common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage of Class A common stock ownership of that person, we assumed the conversion of any Class B common stock beneficially owned by such person into Class A common stock on a share-for-share basis. We did not deem these shares converted, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.
Certain of our directors, a director nominee, and greater than 5% shareholders, who own collectively and in the aggregate approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock and over 50% of the voting power of outstanding common stock, are members of a "group," as that term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  This group is composed of the following individuals and two entities controlled by James R. Scott and Randall I. Scott: James R. Scott, Randall I. Scott, Thomas W. Scott, John M. Heyneman, Jr., Susan S. Heyneman, and Homer A. Scott, Jr. 
Unless otherwise noted below, the address for each director, director nominee, named executive officer and beneficial owner of more than 5% of a class of our common stock listed in the table below is:  c/o First Interstate BancSystem, Inc., 401 North 31st Street, Billings, Montana 59101.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors is accountable to our shareholders to build long-term financial performance and value and to ensure that we operate consistently with Company values and strategic vision. The Board's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  þ Identifying organizational values and vision; þ Ensuring prudence and adherence to ethical practices; 
  þ Hiring and evaluating our Chief Executive Officer; þ Ensuring compliance with federal and state law; 
  þ Providing oversight and counsel to management regarding strategic direction; þ Ensuring that full and fair disclosure is provided to shareholders, regulators, and other constituents; 
  þ Ensuring management succession; þ Overseeing risk management; and 
  þ Monitoring our performance against established criteria; þ Renewing and approving policies for Company operations. 
Board Structure and Composition 
[END TABLE]
The size of our Board must be at least five and not more than eighteen, in accordance with our bylaws. At the end of fiscal year 2018, there were fifteen directors serving on the Board. After the annual meeting, assuming the election of the director nominees as contemplated herein, and expiration of the tenures of Mr. William Ebzery and Mr. Jonathan Scott as discussed elsewhere herein, the Board will have fourteen directors divided into three groups with staggered three-year terms.   The Board does not have a formal written policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. Our governance standards, however, require the Board's Governance & Nominating Committee to review the qualifications of candidates to the Board, of which diversity is one of the criteria. This assessment includes the consideration of personal and professional ethics and integrity, including a candidate's reputation for integrity in the business community; diversity among the existing Board members; specific business experience and competence, including an assessment of whether the candidate has experience in, and possesses an understanding of, business issues applicable to the success of the banking industry and whether the candidate has served in policy-making roles in business, government, education, or other areas that are relevant to the Company's regional activities; financial acumen, including whether the candidate, through education or experience, has an understanding of financial matters and the preparation and analysis of financial statements; professional and personal accomplishments, including involvement in civic and charitable activities; educational background; and whether the candidate has expressed a willingness to devote sufficient time to carrying out his or her duties and responsibilities effectively and is committed to service on the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Controlled Company Exemptions 
[END TABLE]
We qualify as a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules because the Scott Family Control Group, by virtue of its beneficial ownership of both Class A common stock and high-vote Class B common stock, controls approximately 54% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a "controlled company," we are eligible for and have elected to take advantage of exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements to have a  compensation or nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. At such time that the total number of outstanding shares of our high-vote Class B common stock constitutes less than 20% of the total number of all of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, the outstanding shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert on the next record date for a shareholder meeting on a share-for-share basis into shares of Class A common stock. If that were to occur, the Scott family control group would no longer beneficially own shares constituting a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and we would, by virtue thereof, no longer be a "controlled company" eligible to avail ourselves of these exemptions from the NASDAQ rules. As of March 1, 2019, the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represented approximately 37% of the total number of all of our outstanding shares of common stock.    
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
The Board evaluates the independence of each director, including nominees for election to the Board, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, and our corporate governance guidelines. As a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, we are exempt from the requirement to have a majority of independent directors on our Board.  Nevertheless, our corporate governance guidelines require that a majority of our Board members meet the director independence standards under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. All members of our Audit Committee are also independent directors as defined in applicable law and regulation. 
The Board has determined that the following nine continuing directors are independent in accordance with such standards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Steven J. Corning   David L. Jahnke   Patricia L. Moss   
  Dana L. Crandall   Dennis L. Johnson   Teresa A. Taylor   
  Charles E. Hart, M.D.   Ross E. Leckie   Peter I. Wold   
[END TABLE]
The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining independence, including, among other things, making an affirmative determination that the director has no material relationship with the Company directly or as an officer, shareholder, or partner of an organization that has a material relationship with the Company. In its determination of independence, the Board considered that the Company conducts banking and credit transactions in the ordinary course of business with certain independent directors. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below. The Company employs, in non-executive roles, family members of certain directors. None of these transactions or relationships were deemed by the Board to impair the independence of any of these directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Separate Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Roles 
[END TABLE]
Our Board has chosen to separate the roles of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and it has appointed James R. Scott as Chair of the Board.  We believe that separating the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board best serves the current needs of our Company and our shareholders. Our Chair manages the overall Board function, and his current responsibilities include presiding at meetings of the Board; establishing the agenda for each Board meeting in consultation with the Lead Independent Director, our Chief Executive Officer, and other senior management as appropriate; helping to establish, coordinate and review the criteria and methods for evaluating, at least annually, the effectiveness of the Board and its committees; and exercising such other powers and duties as set forth in our bylaws and as may from time to time be assigned to him by the Board. The separation allows Mr. Scott to focus on management of Board matters and allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on the general supervision, direction, and control of our business affairs, and ensure that all orders and resolutions of the Board are implemented.  Additionally, we believe the separation of roles ensures the objectivity of the Board in its management oversight role, specifically with respect to reviewing and assessing our Chief Executive Officer's performance.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Lead Independent Director 
[END TABLE]
The Lead Independent Director, a position currently held by Teresa A. Taylor, serves as a liaison between the Chair, management, and independent directors as well as between the Scott family and independent directors; calls and presides over meetings of the independent directors no less than semi-annually and more often as appropriate; and, if requested by major shareholders or Scott family members, is available for consultation and direct communication. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Meetings and Attendance 
[END TABLE]
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and each committee on which they serve, as well as our annual meeting of shareholders. In 2018, our Board, as then constituted, met ten times, with each serving director who served for the entire year attending at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board. All of our continuing directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders with the exception of one.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Nomination, Selection and Qualifications 
[END TABLE]
The Governance & Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating director nominees and recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. When formulating its recommendations for director nominees, the Governance & Nominating Committee considers recommendations offered by our Chief Executive Officer, our shareholders, and any outside advisors the Governance & Nominating Committee may retain. The Scott family, through a family council, recommends Scott family members to the Governance & Nominating Committee for consideration as candidates for Board membership. James R. Scott, Jr. is standing for re-election to the board. Randall I. Scott was recommended for Board membership by the Scott family council. All candidates for Board membership, including those recommended by the Scott family council, are evaluated by the Governance & Nominating Committee on the basis of broad experience, financial acumen, professional and personal accomplishments, educational background, wisdom, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of our business environment, and willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties. The qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee, together with their business experience, led to the conclusion that each nominee is qualified to serve as a director of the Company.
The Scott family does not approve candidates for Board membership prior to their nomination by the Governance & Nominating Committee and there are no arrangements or understandings between any candidate and the Scott family that require disclosure pursuant to Item 401(a) of Regulation S-K.  
We do not have a formal policy concerning shareholder recommendations of candidates for Board membership. The Board views that such a formal policy is not necessary given the procedures described above and our willingness to consider candidates recommended by shareholders. Shareholders may recommend candidates by writing to our corporate secretary at our headquarters, 401 N. 31st Street, Billings, Montana 59101, giving the candidate's name, contact information, biographical data, and qualifications. A written statement from the candidate consenting to be named as a candidate and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director should accompany any such recommendation. See "Shareholder Proposals" and "Shareholder Communications with the Board" contained herein.

Board Committees and Related Matters 
[END TABLE]
The Board has six standing committees:  Audit, Compensation, Executive, Governance & Nominating, Risk, and Technology. In addition to these committees, our Chair of the Board may from time to time designate and appoint, on a temporary basis, one or more directors to assist in the form of a limited or special assignment in the performance or discharge of any powers and duties of the Board or any committee thereof. In 2017, the Board also had a seventh standing committee, the Credit committee. The Risk Committee of the Board now oversees credit risk, however, as part of its risk oversight responsibilities. Accordingly, the Board has dissolved the Credit Committee.
The Board makes committee and committee chair assignments annually at its meeting immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, although further changes may be made thereafter from time to time as deemed appropriate by the Board or a particular director or directors for personal or other reasons. As a result, the full year 2018 committee membership and meeting information provided below includes information regarding the composition and activities of each of the committees and their members both before and after the annual meeting and other committee realignment determinations made by the Board, as well as individual director decisions made during the year. Each committee has a Board-approved charter, which is reviewed annually by the respective committee. Recommended changes, if any, are submitted to the Board for approval. Each committee may retain and compensate consultants or other advisors as necessary for it to carry out its duties.  A copy of the charters for each standing committee can be found on the Company's website at www.FIBK.com by selecting "Governance Documents." The current membership of each committee, as well as information regarding those members' attendance at committee meetings held while the director was a member of the committee, is provided below.

Compensation Committee Interlock and Insider Participation: No members of the Compensation Committee who served during 2018 were officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during the year, were formerly Company officers or had any relationship otherwise requiring disclosure as a compensation committee interlock. 
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for reviewing and approving corporate goals relevant to compensation for executive officers and evaluating the effectiveness of our compensation practices in achieving our strategic objectives, encouraging behaviors consistent with our values, and aligning performance objectives consistent with our vision. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of our Chief Executive Officer, approves the compensation of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, and oversees succession planning for our executive officers. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for granting awards under the Company's equity and incentive compensation plans and reviewing the financial performance and operation of compensation programs affecting the Company's employees generally. In addition, the Compensation Committee recommends compensation for Board members. Each serving committee member attended at least 75% of the meetings during the period of the director's membership.  
All awards granted to the Company's officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act ("Section 16 Officers") that were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, were approved by the non-employee directors as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act (collectively the "Outside Members").  The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to our Chief Executive Officer to make awards to employees who are not Section 16 Officers.  
Compensation Consultant.  The Compensation Committee has retained the services of Pearl Meyer & Partners, ("PM&P"), a compensation consulting firm, to assist with its executive compensation review and to provide competitive market data.  A consultant from PM&P generally attends the Compensation Committee meetings at which executive officer compensation is discussed and provides information, research, and analysis pertaining to executive compensation and updates on market trends as requested by the Compensation Committee. 
In connection with its engagement of PM&P, the Compensation Committee considered various factors bearing upon PM&P's independence including, but not limited to, the amount of fees received by PM&P from the Company, PM&P's policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest, and the existence of any business or personal relationship that could impact PM&P's independence. After reviewing these and other factors, the Compensation Committee determined that PM&P was independent and that its engagement did not present any conflicts of interest. PM&P does not provide executive compensation services to the Company. 
The Compensation Committee sets compensation levels based on the skills, experience, and achievements of each executive officer, taking into account market analysis and input provided by PM&P and the compensation recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, except with respect to his own position. The Compensation Committee believes that input from both PM&P and our Chief Executive Officer provides useful information and points of view to assist the Compensation Committee in determining the appropriate compensation.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
[END TABLE]
It is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer to fulfill the Board's expectation of a strong risk management culture throughout the organization. It is the responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer to ensure an appropriate risk management framework is implemented to identify, assess, and manage our exposure to risk. The Board and its committees play an important role in overseeing executive management's performance of their responsibilities relating to risk management. In general, this oversight includes working with executive management to determine an appropriate risk management culture, monitoring the amounts and types of risk taken in executing our business strategy, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk management processes against the policies and procedures established to control those risks.  We have adopted a risk management oversight structure designed to ensure that all significant risks are actively monitored by the entire Board or one of its committees. Furthermore, given the importance of the Bank's operations to us, additional risk management oversight is provided by the Bank's board of directors, members of which include certain of our directors.
In most cases, our respective Board committees are responsible for the oversight of specific risks as outlined in each of their respective charters. For example, in addition to its oversight of all aspects of our annual independent audit and the preparation of our financial statements, the Audit Committee has been delegated responsibility for oversight of risks associated with our internal controls, monitoring the implementation of our code of conduct, and overseeing responses to reports of examination. The Compensation Committee has been delegated responsibility for oversight of our compensation programs, including evaluating whether any of these programs contain features that promote excessive risk-taking by management and other employees, either individually or as a group. The Executive Committee oversees our capital positions and capital management activities to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and to ensure that our capital levels are a source of financial strength. The Governance & Nominating Committee has been delegated responsibility for establishing and reviewing the adequacy of our code of conduct; reviewing and approving related party transactions; developing criteria and qualifications for Board membership; considering, recommending, and recruiting candidates to fill new or vacant positions on the Board; and ensuring an effective and efficient system of governance is in place. The Risk Committee further assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities by monitoring whether its risk governance processes are adequate, enterprise-wide risk monitoring activities are appropriate, and the enterprise-wide risk program is effective. The Risk Committee also provides oversight for compliance, credit, liquidity, and market risk. The Technology Committee has been delegated responsibility for ensuring adequate processes are in place to protect our data. The committee chairs meet bi-annually to review each committee's responsibilities for the oversight of specific risks.
In addition to oversight of risk management by the Board and its committees, the Bank's board of directors and its committees have been delegated the responsibility for overseeing management of the Bank's lending activities, liquidity and capital position, asset quality, interest rate risk, and investment strategies. The chairman of the Bank's board communicates relevant information with respect to these activities to the full Board.
The Board's committees carry out their responsibilities by requesting and obtaining reports and other information from management with respect to relevant risk areas. In addition to our committee structure, our entire Board periodically receives reports and information about key risks and enterprise risk management from the chief risk officer.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee charter requires advance approval of all audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to assure that such services do not impair the auditor's independence from the Company.  The Audit Committee may delegate the authority to pre-approve services to the Audit Committee chair or any two other members of the Audit Committee, subject to ratification by the Audit Committee at its next committee meeting. In 2018 and 2017, all of the fees paid to our independent auditor were approved in advance by the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee Report 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is currently composed of six independent directors and operates under a charter approved by the Board of Directors. The SEC and the NASDAQ have established standards relating to Audit Committee membership and functions. With regard to such membership standards, the Board has determined that David L. Jahnke, Dennis L. Johnson, and Ross E. Leckie meet the requirements of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC and each of the Audit Committee members have the requisite financial literacy and accounting or related financial management expertise required generally of an Audit Committee member under the applicable standards of the SEC and NASDAQ.
The primary duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to monitor: (i) the quality and integrity of the financial statements and related internal controls; (ii) the internal audit and independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors; and (iv) compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. While the Audit Committee has the duties and responsibilities set forth above and those set forth in its charter: management is responsible for the internal controls and the financial reporting process; the Company's internal auditors are responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and conducting internal audits under the control of the Chief Audit Executive, who is accountable to the Audit Committee; and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an integrated audit of our financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and issuing a report thereon.
The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee also relies on the opinions of the independent auditors on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's oversight does not provide assurance that management's and the auditor's opinions and representations are correct.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has performed the duties required by its charter, including meeting and holding discussions with management, the independent registered public accounting firm and internal audit, and has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's review of and discussions about the financial statements included discussions about the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles used, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditors all matters required to be discussed by the applicable standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence and any relationships that might have an impact on their objectivity and independence, and reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid for audit and audit-related services.
Based upon a review of the reports and discussions with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, subject to the limitations on its role and responsibilities described above and in the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements. RSM US LLP (RSM) has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since they were appointed in fiscal 2004. In determining whether to reappoint RSM, the Audit Committee takes into consideration various factors, including: the historical and recent performance of RSM on the audit; its professional qualifications; the quality of ongoing discussions with RSM; external data, including recent PCAOB reports on RSM; the appropriateness of fees and RSM's tenure, including the benefits of that tenure, and the controls and processes in place (such as rotation of key partners every five years) that help ensure RSM's continued independence in the face of such tenure. The process for selection of a new lead engagement partner includes meetings between the candidates for that role and senior management and the Chair of the Audit Committee, as well as discussion with the full Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has selected RSM to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

2018 Performance 
[END TABLE]
Our performance for 2018 was highlighted by the successful acquisition of Northwest Bancorporation, Inc., parent company of Inland Northwest Bank ("INB") and the announcement of the two pending acquisitions of Idaho Independent Bank and Community 1st Bank.  The Northwest Bancorporation, Inc. acquisition was completed on August 16, 2018, and the Company merged INB with our existing bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, on November 9, 2018. This transaction expanded our presence in the high-growth markets in the Northwest. 
During 2018, we reported earnings of $160.2 million, or $2.75 per diluted share. Earnings levels benefited from four months of INB earnings, improved credit quality, expanded net interest margin, and the impact of tax reform. Our reported return on average common equity was 10.50% and our return on average assets was 1.27%. 
Exclusive of acquisition-related expenses and net investment securities gains (losses), our 2018 earnings would have increased 31.3% over our similarly calculated 2017 earnings. 
We have paid over 24 years of consecutive quarterly dividends. During 2018, we increased quarterly dividends by 16.7% to $0.28 per common share, and we recently announced a 10.7% increase in quarterly dividends to $0.31 per common share for the first quarter of 2019, which equates to an annualized yield of 2.98% based on the $41.55 average closing price of our stock during the fourth quarter of 2018. We remained focused on people, processes, and technology throughout 2018. We continued to invest in our people by enhancing our benefits, our training opportunities, and our communications at all levels to ensure our teams are aligned with our vision, mission, and values. We strengthened our executive team and instituted a senior leadership team.  These changes allowed us to realign roles and responsibilities across the Company to enhance clarity and accountability. 
We continued to enhance Company-wide systems and processes to ensure continued delivery of quality products and services to our clients.  We are improving our loan processes to streamline and standardize workflows to allow consistent, timely interactions with our clients. 
The Company continued to align itself for success as we work towards finalizing technology infrastructure projects that will support the long-term growth of the Company.  We are building a technology ecosystem that will allow us to be more flexible and adaptable to technology changes now and into the future.  We are expanding our digital initiatives to allow online mortgage, credit card, and small business applications.  
Underlying these efforts, the Company continues to monitor employee engagement and client satisfaction. The Company believes that satisfied employees create satisfied clients; which is good for the communities we serve, the Company, and our shareholders. Annual employee surveys provide leadership the necessary feedback to respond to areas of opportunity and to highlight and celebrate areas of success. In 2018, the Company expanded its Voice of the Client program to include client panels in all of our markets, as well as transaction based surveys and an annual client survey. We provide real time feedback to our teams which allows them to continually fine tune our in-branch client experience. Our goal is to deliver a consistent client experience across our six state footprint.
Three-year financial metrics are shown in the tables below. The 2018, 2017 and 2016 metrics include the impact of acquisition related expenses of $12.4 million, $27.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively.  In 2016, non-interest income included a litigation recovery of $4.2 million.

Factors Considered in Determining Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Consultant and Management
The Compensation Committee approves our compensation structure, policy, and programs to ensure we have in place appropriate executive officer incentives and employee benefits.  Outside members of the Compensation Committee (those members who meet both the definition of a non-employee director, as that term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and an outside director, as that term was defined for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code), have reviewed and determined the salary, short-term incentives, and long-term equity incentives awarded to our Chief Executive Officer, approved all executive officers' compensation, and approved the total dollar value of equity awards for all other officers, taking into consideration non-binding recommendations from non-Outside Members, market analysis, input by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, except with respect to his own compensation. 
Role of Compensation Consultants/Peer Group Market Analysis
We use comparative executive officer compensation data publicly disclosed by a peer group of public companies in addition to compensation survey data to evaluate the competitiveness of our executive officer compensation and to guide the compensation for newly hired executive officers. During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged the services of a compensation consulting firm, Pearl Meyers & Partners (PM&P), to assist with our executive compensation review and to provide competitive market data. PM&P performed a comprehensive review of our executive compensation in 2018 by obtaining proxy data based on PM&P's recommended peer group, which includes banking organizations with asset size, geography and operational and business model characteristics similar to ours. The peer group was composed of the following banks:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BancorpSouth, Inc. First Midwest Bancorp, Inc. International Bancshares Corporation Trustmark Corporation 
  Banner Corporation Fulton Financial Corporation NBT Bancorp, Inc. United Bankshares, Inc. 
  Chemical Financial Corporation Glacier Bancorp, Inc. Old National Bancorp United Community Banks, Inc. 
  Columbia Banking System, Inc. Great Western Bancorp, Inc. Renasant Corporation Washington Federal, Inc. 
  First Financial Bancorp Heartland Financial USA Inc. Simmons First National Corporation WesBanco, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
Changes to the peer group from the previous year include the addition of Great Western Bancorp, Inc. and Heartland Financial USA Inc., each of which was added based on its asset size, operating revenues, market capitalization, and business models. F.N.B. Corporation and IBERIABANK Corporation were removed from the peer group because they no longer met the relevant criteria to be included.
The Compensation Committee exercises its business judgment and discretion in determining executive compensation and generally targets market competitive (50th percentile) base pay, incentives, and total cash compensation within the peer group.

Base Salaries
The Board approved the 2018 base salary of Mr. Riley, our current Chief Executive Officer, and the Compensation Committee approved the 2018 compensation of other executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, as recommended by our Chief Executive Officer. Increases to base salary ranged from 0% to 25% in 2018, and were based on the Compensation Committee's review of market data from our peer group defined above, as well as the results achieved by each executive, his or her future potential, scope of responsibilities, and experience.
The following table shows the 2018 base salary of each Named Executive Officer.

Short-Term Incentives
Our executive officers are eligible for annual cash-based short-term incentives under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee sets the target opportunity of the short-term incentive awards as a percentage of an executive's base salary. Varying short-term incentive award percentages reflect the Compensation Committee's belief that an executive officer's scope of work, responsibilities, and performance should all be considered when awarding incentives. The Company's award opportunities are established at threshold, target, and maximum levels. The funding percentage between each of the levels is interpolated on a linear basis, with the funding percentage to be 0% for all performance below the threshold level. The maximum payout opportunity for each metric is capped at 150% of the target percentage. The plan also has a discretionary component whereby the Compensation Committee can choose to apply a modifier to the calculated funding percentage based on the Company's performance. For 2018, the discretionary areas the Committee reviewed were in the areas of customer satisfaction and employee engagement. The discretionary modifier allows the Committee to adjust the short-term funding percentage plus or minus 10%. The performance goals for the Named Executive Officers were established in January 2018. As a group, the Named Executive Officers' short-term incentive payouts in 2018, after the application of the Committee's exercise of its discretion, were 100.27% of target. 
Named Executive Officer Short-Term Incentive
The 2018 short-term incentive plan opportunity for the Named Executive Officers was based on 2018 Company performance. Metrics included adjusted net income and adjusted efficiency ratio, which overall were at 96.21% of target. The Committee determined the outcome for the discretionary component on the basis of the results for the Company's 2018 employee engagement and customer satisfaction surveys. Based on the survey results, the Committee approved a positive modifier of 5% to be applied to the base results. These metrics were aligned with the operating objectives of the Company's business, with 100% of the award based on the Company's overall performance and each executive officer's accomplishments measured against individual performance plan objectives. Short-term incentive funding for the Company in 2018 was 101.02% of target.

(7)  Mr. Yose received a 2018 short-term incentive payout of $169,680, which included 101% of Mr. Yose's target short-term incentive based on Company performance. Long-Term Incentives 
We believe long-term equity incentive compensation encourages employees to focus on our long-term performance.  Long-term incentives in the form of equity compensation also provide an opportunity for executive officers and certain designated key employees to increase their equity ownership in the Company, further aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. 
In 2018, long-term incentives awarded to the Named Executive Officers included an equal mix of performance-vested and time- vested restricted stock. Our Chief Executive Officer's long-term incentive award is equal to approximately 105% of his base salary, and the remaining Named Executive Officers' long-term incentive awards are equal to approximately 50% of their base salaries. The value of the long-term incentive awards to our officers, including the Named Executive Officers, is based primarily on the individual's ability to influence the Company's long-term growth and profitability.
Time vested restricted stock awards have a three-year graded vesting period. Performance vested restricted stock awards vest in varying percentages based upon the Company's performance relative to that of a peer group composed of the SNL Financial index ("SNL Index") of bank holding companies with total assets between 50% and 200% of our December 31, 2018 total assets. The 2019 award vesting percentages range from 0% to 200% of target and are based on the Company's three-year return on equity weighted at 40% and the three-year total shareholder return weighted at 60%. The measurement period for 2019 performance vested restricted stock awards runs from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 using the previous 12 quarters' performance. The performance awards granted in 2019 will vest on March 15, 2022. 
The award range for the 2019 awards is interpolated on a linear basis, except that the adjustment percentage will equal 0% for a ranking below the 35th percentile. Vesting is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Percentile Ranking Award Range 
Below 35th percentile 0% 
35th percentile 50% 
50th percentile 100% 
90th percentile 200% 
[END TABLE]
All awards under our equity compensation plan are based on the closing price of the underlying common stock as quoted on NASDAQ Stock Market for the last market trading day prior to the date of the award. Dollar values of the annual awards of long-term incentives to executives have historically been approved at the Compensation Committee's regularly scheduled meeting in January with the date of the awards specified at that time.  
Results of the 2016 Long Term Incentive Performance Awards
Performance vested restricted shares awarded to executive officers in 2016 for the measurement period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 are scheduled to vest on March 15, 2019. The 2016 performance vested restricted shares will vest based upon the Company's performance relative to that of a peer group comprised of the SNL Financial Index of bank holding companies with total assets between 50% and 200% of our December 31, 2016 total assets, and were based on First Interstate's three-year return on average assets, three-year return on average equity and the three-year average total shareholder return. The measurement date for 2016 performance vested restricted stock awards was December 31, 2018 using the previous 12 quarters' performance.
The pre-defined performance objectives for January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 were as follows:

Comprehensive Benefits Package
We provide a competitive benefits package to all full-time employees, including the Named Executive Officers, that includes health and welfare benefits such as medical, dental, vision care, disability insurance, and life insurance benefits, and a 401(k) savings plan. We also provide a profit sharing plan for all non-temporary employees under which contributions are made as authorized by our Board. Participants vest in profit sharing amounts after three years of service. 
We provide a non-qualified deferred compensation plan under which eligible participants may defer a portion of their base salary or short-term incentives subject to certain maximums as set forth by the plan administrator. Additionally, we make discretionary contributions on behalf of the executive officer participants for 401(k) plan matching contributions and profit sharing contributions in excess of Code limitations. Other contributions on behalf of a participant may be made at the discretion of our Board.
We have obtained life insurance policies covering selected officers of our banking subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, including certain of our Named Executive Officers. Under these policies, we receive benefits payable upon death of the insured. An endorsement split dollar agreement or survivor income benefit agreement has been executed with each of the insureds whereby a portion of the death benefit or a lump-sum survivor benefit is payable to the insured's designated beneficiary if the participant is employed by us at the time of death. 
Perquisites
Perquisites offered to the Named Executive Officers may include payment of the following: social club dues and the use of a Company automobile.  
Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits
We provide severance pay and other benefits to executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, who have their employment terminated, including through involuntary termination by us without cause and, in some cases, voluntary termination by the executive for good reason. These arrangements provide security of transition income and benefit replacements that allow such executives to focus on our prospective business priorities that create value for shareholders. We believe the level of severance and benefits provided by these arrangements is consistent with the practices of our peers and are necessary to attract and retain key employees.  Potential payments and benefits available under these arrangements are discussed further under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control."  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Matters 
[END TABLE]
Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows an income tax deduction to public companies for annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and the three other most highly compensated Named Executive Officers for the taxable year. For periods prior to 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" or satisfied another exception was excluded for purposes of calculating the amount of compensation subject to the $1 million limit. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, however, the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, such that compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 for performance-based compensation. The Compensation Committee considers tax and accounting consequences in developing and implementing our executive compensation program and believes that compensation paid under our management incentive plans in taxable years prior to 2018 is generally fully deductible for federal income tax purposes. Deductibility of awards will likely continue as one factor in determining executive compensation, but the Compensation Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions, as noted above, and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible by the Company for tax purposes.
Securities Trading Policy
Our insider trading policy prohibits our directors and employees from trading in our securities during certain designated blackout periods and otherwise while they are aware of material non-public information, and from engaging in hedging transactions or short sales and trading in puts and calls with respect to our securities. The policy also cautions against holding our securities in a margin account or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.
Clawback Provisions
In 2011, based on the Compensation Committee's recommendation, the Board approved a clawback policy for all Section 16 reporting officers, including the Named Executive Officers. The clawback policy authorizes the Board to recoup all performance-based compensation paid during the years affected by a financial restatement or executive misconduct. The Board may also direct the Company to cancel any equity-based awards granted to the executives during the applicable time period and recoup any gains realized during the time period with respect to equity-based awards.
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In order to further align the interests of the employees with the interests of the Company, our Board approved a stock ownership guideline policy whereby each executive officer is expected to acquire and maintain ownership of our common stock equal in value to a specified multiple of the executive officer's base salary.  
The policy recommends the following stock holdings for our Named Executive Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Stock Ownership Guideline 
Chief Executive Officer Five (5) times base salary 
Named Executive Officers (excluding Chief Executive Officer) Three (3) times base salary 
[END TABLE]
Stock holdings are measured at the end of each year using the year's closing stock price. Each Named Executive Officer is expected to meet the ownership guidelines by the later of January 1, 2018 or five years from the date he or she became a Named Executive Officer.  Equity Granting Practices
The Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan under which the Compensation Committee (or a subcommittee thereof) approves equity awards to certain officers, including the Named Executive Officers. Awards are granted to enhance our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees and directors who are expected to make important contributions to us by providing them with both equity ownership opportunities and performance-based incentives intended to align their interests with those of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, subject to certain terms and limitations as established by the Committee, to make awards to employees who are not Section 16 officers.  For additional information regarding our equity compensation plans, see "Equity Compensation Plans."
Results of Shareholder Advisory Approval of Named Executive Officer Compensation
The Company holds non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation every other year with the last vote occurring during the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders. At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders were asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the Named Executive Officer compensation for 2016 as reported in our 2017 joint proxy statement/prospectus. This say-on-pay proposal was approved by over 99% of the shares present and entitled to vote. The Compensation Committee considered the results of the 2017 advisory vote along with shareholder input and other factors discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and concluded that no changes to our compensation policies and practices were warranted in response to the shareholder advisory vote. 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs 
The Compensation Committee designs our compensation programs to encourage appropriate risk taking while discouraging behavior that may result in unnecessary or excessive risk. In this regard, the following elements have been incorporated in our compensation programs for executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  þ Use of multiple metrics in annual incentive plan and use of two long-term incentive vehicles for executive officers; 
  þ Each short-term incentive award metric capped at 150%; 
  þ Performance-based share awards capped at 200%; 
  þ Time-based share awards vest ratably over three years; 
  þ Emphasis on long-term and performance-based compensation; 
  þ Formal clawback policies applicable to both cash and equity compensation; and 
  þ Alignment of interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders through stock ownership guidelines that call for significant share ownership. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews with management an assessment of whether risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, as well as the means by which any potential risks may be mitigated, such as through governance and oversight policies. Based on its most recent assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation policies and practices for all employees do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Stock awards are a combination of time-based vesting and performance-based vesting restricted stock awards. The above table includes the value of the 2016 performance awards based on return on average assets, return on average equity and total shareholder return performance at the 50th to 100th percentile, the value of the 2017 and 2018 performance awards based on return on average equity and total shareholder return performance at the 50th and 100th percentile, which would entitle the Named Executive Officers to receive 100% of the performance based vesting restricted stock awarded, or the target shares. The maximum vesting for the performance awards is 150% of target shares for 2016, if return on average assets, return on average equity and total shareholder return performance are at or above the 75% percentile of the SNL Index for 2016, and 150% of target shares for 2017 and 2018, if return on average equity and total shareholder return performance are at or above the 75% percentile of the SNL Index for 2017. The 2016 performance based restricted stock awards are scheduled to vest at 115.50% of target on March 15, 2019.

Equity Compensation Plans 
[END TABLE]
The Company has equity awards outstanding under two stock-based compensation plans; the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") and the 2006 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, (the "2006 Plan"). These plans were primarily established to enhance the Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees. 
The 2015 Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2015, was established to provide us with flexibility to select from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address changing accounting and tax rules and corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance based compensation.  The 2015 Plan did not increase the number of shares of common stock available for awards under the 2006 Plan. 
The 2006 Plan, approved by the Company's shareholders in May 2006 and May 2014, was established to consolidate into one plan the benefits available under all other then-existing share-based award plans (collectively with the 2006 Plan, the "Previous Plans"). The Previous Plans continue to govern awards made prior to May 2015.  The 2015 Plan contains the following important features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
þ The maximum number of shares of our Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 2,000,000, which was approximately 9.2% of our previously-existing Class A Common Stock outstanding at the time of shareholder approval. 
þ The 2015 Plan prohibits the repricing of awards without shareholder approval. 
þ The 2015 Plan prohibits the recycling of shares. 
þ Awards under the 2015 Plan are subject to broad discretion by the Compensation Committee administering the plan. 
þ All awards under the 2015 Plan are based on the closing price of the underlying common stock as quoted on NASDAQ Stock Market for the last market trading day prior to the date of the award. 
[END TABLE]
The following terms apply to equity awards granted for each of the last three years:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-restricted awards - three-year graded vesting period; and 
• Performance-restricted awards - cliff vesting as of March 15th of the third year following the year of the award for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, based on achievement of specified performance conditions.

2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
[END TABLE]
The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") established for the benefit of a select group of management and highly-compensated employees, including Named Executive Officers.  Under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees, as determined by our Board or Compensation Committee, may defer a portion of base salary or short-term incentives subject to certain maximums as set forth by the plan administrator. Deferral elections are made by eligible executives during the last quarter of each year for amounts to be earned in the following year.  We make discretionary contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan on behalf of the executive officer participants for 401(k) plan matching contributions and profit sharing contributions in excess of Code limitations. Other contributions on behalf of a participant may be made at the discretion of our Board. 
The deferral account of each participant is adjusted by investment earnings or losses based upon the performance of the underlying investments selected by the participant from among alternatives selected by the plan administrator.  Benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan are generally not paid until the beginning of the year following the participant's retirement or termination from the Company.  Benefits can be received either as a lump sum payment or in annual installments based on the executive's election made at least one year prior to retirement. The distribution elections are all made in accordance with Section 409A. 
The following table shows the contributions, earnings and aggregate balance of total deferrals by our Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2018.

2018 Other Compensation 
[END TABLE]
We provide our Named Executive Officers with other compensation that the Compensation Committee believes is reasonable and consistent with the overall compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the levels of other compensation provided to Named Executive Officers.
The Named Executive Officers participate in the following plans and programs along with health and group life and disability insurance. Additional benefits offered to the Named Executive Officers may include some or all of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• individual life insurance, as described below under "Survivor Income Benefits;" 
• payment of social club dues;  
• dividends on unvested restricted stock;  
• use of a Company automobile; and 
• long-term care insurance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Survivor Income Benefits 
[END TABLE]
We obtained life insurance policies on selected officers of First Interstate Bank. Under these policies, we receive all benefits payable upon death of the insured.  A survivor income agreement was executed with each of the insured officers whereby a survivor benefit of $150,000 is payable to designated beneficiaries if the participant is employed by us at the time of death. We have entered into this type of survivor income agreement with Mr. Riley.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Retirement and Related Plan 
[END TABLE]
We maintain a profit sharing plan for all non-temporary employees. Contributions are made as authorized by the Board. Participants vest after three years of service. In addition, employees are permitted to defer a portion of their compensation into our profit sharing plan under a 401(k) feature, and we make limited matching contributions with respect to such deferrals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer Total Compensation 
[END TABLE]
The Outside Members of the Compensation Committee reviewed all components of the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation package.  Mr. Riley was appointed as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer on September 23, 2015. The compensation paid to Mr. Riley during his tenure as Chief Executive Officer was determined to be low as compared to that of our peers' Chief Executive Officer total compensation data.  Mr. Riley's compensation package was larger than those granted to our other executives in recognition of the increased level of responsibility and performance required of our chief executive officer.   
As part of its role, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, which provided that we may not deduct compensation of more than $1,000,000 that is paid to certain individuals with certain exceptions. We believe that performance-based compensation paid in 2017 and prior periods under the management incentive plans is generally fully deductible for federal income tax purposes. As discussed above, however, the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
Despite the Compensation Committee's efforts to structure the executive team annual incentives in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) and therefore not subject to its deduction limits, because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing the Section 162(m) exemption from the deduction limit, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) in fact will. Further, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company's business needs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer ("PEO"). The Company's PEO is Mr. Riley, our Chief Executive Officer.  Registrants must comply with the pay ratio rule for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.  The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization.  
In determining the median employee, a listing was prepared of all employees as of December 14, 2018. Wages and benefits were annualized for those employees not employed for the full year of 2018. There were 114 employees acquired through the INB acquisition who were excluded from the list since we just completed the integration in November and the Company was not responsible for setting their compensation for most of 2018. The median amount was selected from the resulting list.  For purposes of determining total compensation, the following earnings were included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary 
• Short-Term Incentive 
• Long-Term Incentive comprised of stock awards 
• Other Compensation comprised of: 
◦ Contributions by us to our qualified profit sharing and employee savings plans, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code 
◦ Contributions by us to our nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
◦ Premiums paid by us for individual long-term care plans 
◦ Dividends on unvested restricted stock 
◦ Amounts paid by us for social club dues, signing bonuses, and moving/relocation expenses

Employment Agreements 
[END TABLE]
Effective in April 2018, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with Mr. Riley, Ms. Mutch, Ms. Delahunt Hubbell, and Mr. Gaglia.
The original term of the agreements is for three years, commencing on the effective date. After the initial term, the agreement automatically renews for an additional one year period on each anniversary of the effective date, unless the Company gives the executive notice of termination 90 days prior to expiration.  
The agreements outline the duties of each employee and forms of remuneration awarded for the performance of such duties, including base salary, bonuses, and various other employer provided benefits. In addition, the agreements outline specific duties and payments to be made upon termination of employment under various conditions.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
[END TABLE]
Termination in connection with a change in control: In the event of an involuntary termination of employment without cause (as defined in each executive's agreement) or voluntary termination by the executive for good reason (as defined in each executive's agreement) within 6 months preceding or 18 months after a change in control (as defined in each executive's agreement), Mr. Riley will receive an amount equal to 2 times his base salary plus an amount equal to 2 times the average of the annual incentive compensation paid to Executive during each of the three years immediately prior to the year in which the Event of Termination occurs; Ms. Mutch, Ms. Delahunt Hubbell, and Mr. Gaglia shall receive an amount equal to 1.5 times the Executive's base salary plus an amount equal to 1.5 times the average of the annual incentive compensation paid to Executive during each of the three years immediately prior to the year in which the Event of Termination occurs (the "Change in Control Payment"). In addition, all outstanding unvested restricted stock will fully vest upon termination and the Company will provide certain employment benefits for a period of 18 months following the date of termination. The benefits may be limited, however, if the executive is initially determined to be subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 and 280G of the Internal Revenue Code but would be better off on a net-after tax basis by reducing the Change in Control Payments to avoid being subject to the excise tax. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Payments Made upon Termination 
[END TABLE]
Involuntary or good reason termination unrelated to a change in control: In the event of an involuntary termination by the Company without cause or voluntary termination by the executive for good reason, Mr. Riley's executive employment agreement indicates he shall receive an amount equal to 2 times the sum of his base salary, plus his average annual incentive compensation paid during the three years prior to termination; Ms. Mutch, Ms. Delahunt Hubbell, and Mr. Gaglia shall receive an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of their base salary, plus their average annual incentive compensation paid during the three years prior to termination. In the absence of an employment agreement, regardless of the manner in which a Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated, he or she may receive amounts earned during his term of employment. Such amounts include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary; 
• grants and awards received under our equity plans, subject to the vesting and other terms applicable to such grants and awards; 
• amounts contributed and vested under our profit sharing plan and deferred compensation plan; and 
• unused paid time off. 
[END TABLE]
In its discretion, the Board, or the Chief Executive Officer (except with regard to any payments made on his behalf) may authorize payment of additional separation amounts for the Named Executive Officers.  The Board may also accelerate the vesting of any unexercisable stock options or restricted stock awards outstanding at the time of termination. The amounts regarding applicable salaries, stock options, restricted stock awards, short-term incentives and deferred compensation for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are contained in the various tables included above.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Payments Made upon Retirement 
[END TABLE]
Upon termination based on Retirement, a Named Executive Officer shall be entitled to all benefits under any retirement plan of the Company and other plans to which Named Executive Officer is a party. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Payments Made upon Death 
[END TABLE]
In the event of termination due to death, in addition to the benefits listed under the heading "Payments Made upon Termination" above, the estates or other beneficiaries of the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive benefits under our group life insurance plan equal to the lesser of (i) 2.5 times their respective base salary or (ii) $300,000.  For all Named Executive Officers, the applicable amount would be $300,000. 
An additional $150,000 of survivor income benefit pursuant to life insurance policies covering selected officers of First Interstate Bank is available to the beneficiaries of Mr. Riley should death occur while he is employed by the Company.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Payments Made upon Disability 
[END TABLE]
In the event of termination due to disability, in addition to the benefits listed under the heading "Payments Made upon Termination" above, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive benefits under our group disability plan which generally provides for 60% of pre-disability earnings up to a maximum of $13,000 per month. For each of the Named Executive Officers the applicable amount would be $13,000 per month. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Change in Control and Employment Termination 
[END TABLE]
The individual award agreements governing outstanding unvested restricted stock awards provides for accelerated vesting upon the recipient's death or disability, as defined under the employment agreements.
Per Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, certain payments to the Named Executive Officers would not commence for six months following a termination of employment. If required by Code Section 409A, such payment or a portion of such payment (to the minimum extent possible) shall be delayed and shall be paid on the first day of the seventh month following Named Executive Officer's separation from service. 
The following tables show payments our Named Executive Officers may have received assuming various employment termination and change-in-control scenarios occurring on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the tables reflect estimated amounts. The actual amounts would need to be calculated upon the actual termination of employment.

Director Compensation 
[END TABLE]
We use a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our Board. In setting director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties as well as the skill level required by us with respect to members of the Board. 
During 2018, each director, other than Kevin P. Riley and James R. Scott, received an annual retainer valued at $50,000, with at least $25,000 of that being paid in the form of equity and the remaining $25,000 paid in the form of cash or common stock at the Director's election. 
For his services as Chair of the Board, James R. Scott received an annual retainer of $229,998, of which $120,000 was paid to him in quarterly installments of $30,000, and $109,998 was issued in the form of company stock. These retainers were in lieu of all director fees and other retainers described above. The retainer paid to James R. Scott recognizes his work in providing an interface between the Board and our management, oversight of strategic planning, leadership of the Board, deployment and the creation of shareholder value, executive succession planning, and community visibility.

(1)  The amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Because of the limited number of stock awards granted to non-employee directors, the number of outstanding stock awards held by the directors at December 31, 2018 was not materially different from the amounts reflected in the relevant footnotes to the Beneficial Ownership Table included herein under the heading "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management." 
(2)  The amounts in All Other Compensation includes compensation as an employee of the Company. 
(3)  Mr. Riley received no compensation for serving as a director, but he was compensated in his capacity as President and Chief Executive Officer and his compensation is included herein in the "Summary Compensation Table." 
(4)  Mr. Johnson received a one-time payment of $32,461 in 2018, which is reflected under All Other Compensation, for the payout of his deferred Restricted Stock Units which were issued under the Cascade Bancorp Equity & Incentive Plan as a director of Cascade Bancorp. 
(5)  Due to term limits that require certain Scott family members to have at least a one-year break in service after serving two consecutive three-year terms, Randall I. Scott's most recent term ended in May of 2018. 
(6)  Mr. Williams announced his resignation as a director effective March 22, 2018. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
[END TABLE]
Under our stock ownership guidelines, each director is expected to acquire and maintain ownership of our common stock equal in value to three times his or her annual cash and stock retainer. Stock holdings are measured at the end of each year using the year's closing stock price.  Each director is expected to meet the ownership guidelines within five years from the date he or she became a director. All directors with the exception of one recently elected director have met the recommended levels of stock ownership.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Related Person Transaction Policy 
[END TABLE]
Our Board has adopted a related person transaction policy that is applicable to our executive officers, directors and certain entities and individuals related to such persons. The policy, as amended, generally provides that we will not enter into any transactions with related parties unless such transaction(s) are (1) reviewed by the independent directors of our Governance & Nominating Committee after disclosure of the relevant facts and circumstances, including any benefits to the Company and the terms of any comparable products or services provided by unrelated third parties, and (2) determined by the independent directors of our Governance & Nominating Committee to be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, The policy also provides that the chairman of such committee, who is an independent director, has delegated authority to approve such transaction(s) in certain circumstances, subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Governance & Nominating Committee. The policy does not apply to loan and credit transactions to directors and executive officers that are covered by Regulation O adopted by the Federal Reserve.
All of the ongoing related party transactions described below were reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the Governance & Nominating Committee in accordance with the policy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Related Party Transactions 
[END TABLE]
We conduct banking transactions in the ordinary course of business with related parties, including directors, executive officers, shareholders, and their associates on the same terms as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and that do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
Certain executive officers, directors, and greater than 5% shareholders of the Company and certain entities and individuals related to such persons have incurred indebtedness in the form of loans, as customers, in an amount equal to $43.2 million as of December 31, 2018. During 2018, new loans and advances on existing loans of $7.6 million were funded and loan repayments totaled $17.4 million. These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to us. 
We lease an aircraft from an entity in which James R. Scott, current Chair of our Board, has a one-third ownership interest.  Under the terms of the lease, we pay a fee for each flight hour. During 2018, we paid total fees and operating expenses of $53 thousand for our use of the aircraft. In addition, we lease a portion of our hanger and provide pilot services to the related entity. During 2018, we received payments from the related entity for Mr. Scott's personal use of the aircraft. These payments included  $7 thousand for a lease to use the Company's hanger and $25 thousand for reimbursement of pilot fees.
James R. Scott, Thomas W. Scott, three of our current directors, John M. Heyneman, Jr., Jonathan R. Scott, and James R. Scott, Jr., and two members of our control group, Homer A. Scott, Jr., who is also a greater than 5% shareholder individually, and Randall I. Scott, who is also a greater than 5% shareholder individually, each has a 1.85% interest in Scott Family Services, Inc. ("SFS"), which provides professional services that benefit us and the Scott family.  In addition, Randall I. Scott is the chairman of the board of directors of SFS. Services provided for our benefit include assistance with SEC compliance actions including the tracking and administration of Scott Family FIBK stock ownership, administration and facilitation of FIBK shareholder development within the Scott Family, facilitation of communications within the Scott Family specific to stock trading and other policies, stockholder restrictions and regulatory filings, and corporate governance consultation. During 2018, we paid $80 thousand for these services. SFS reimburses us for all salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses incurred by us on its behalf for personnel. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Conflict of Interest Policy 
[END TABLE]
On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to complete a director and officer questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transactions with our Company in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, have a direct or indirect material interest. Under our code of conduct, all employees, including executive officers, are expected to avoid conflicts of interest. Pursuant to our code of ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior finance officers, such officers are prohibited from engaging in activities that are or may appear to be a conflict of interest unless a specific, case-by-case exception has first been reviewed and approved by the Board. All of our directors are subject to the Board's governance standards that include a code of ethics and conduct guide requiring the directors to avoid conflicts of interest.

We are pleased to take advantage of the SEC e-proxy rules that allow companies to post their proxy materials on the internet. We will be able to provide our shareholders with the information they need while lowering the cost of the delivery of materials and reducing the environmental impact of printing and mailing hard copies. As permitted by the SEC rules, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or the Notice, to our shareholders on or about March 22, 2019. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to above and in the Notice. Shareholders will also have the ability to request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. Instructions on how to vote your shares and how to download a proxy card for voting at the annual meeting will also be contained in the Notice. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
What is a proxy? 
[END TABLE]
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote on your behalf. By completing and returning the proxy card, you are giving the persons designated in the proxy the authority to vote your shares in the manner you indicate on the proxy card. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Why did I receive more than one proxy card? 
[END TABLE]
While we have attempted to consolidate your holdings onto one proxy card, you may receive multiple proxy cards if you hold your shares in different ways (e.g., joint tenancy, trusts, custodial accounts) or in multiple accounts. In addition, if your shares are held by a broker or trustee, you will receive your proxy card or other voting information from your broker or trustee. You should vote separately with respect to each proxy card you receive as each will have a separate control number and will be related to different shares beneficially owned by you. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Who pays the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
[END TABLE]
We pay the costs of soliciting proxies. Upon request, we will reimburse brokers, banks, trusts, and other nominees for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Is this proxy statement the only way that proxies are being solicited? 
[END TABLE]
In addition to these proxy materials, certain of our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, e-mail, or personal contact. They will not be specifically compensated for doing so.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Voting Information 
Who is qualified to vote? 
[END TABLE]
You are qualified to receive notice of and to vote at the annual meeting if you owned of record shares of our Class A or Class B common stock as of the close of business on our record date of March 1, 2019.
[BEGIN TABLE]
How many shares of common stock may vote at the annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
As of the record date, there were 38,281,996 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and entitled to vote and 22,394,860 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at our annual meeting.  Our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock are referred to collectively as our "common stock."
[BEGIN TABLE]
How are votes counted? 
[END TABLE]
The proxies appointed by the Board will vote your shares as you instruct on your proxy.  Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to five votes on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders.  Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of shareholders, unless otherwise required by law or the Company's Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Is there a quorum requirement?  
[END TABLE]
For the annual meeting to be valid, there must be a quorum present. A quorum requires that more than 50% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding common stock be represented at the meeting, whether in person or by proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
What is the difference between a "shareholder of record" and other "beneficial" holders?  
[END TABLE]
These terms describe how your shares are held. If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are a "shareholder of record." If your shares are held on your behalf in the name of a broker, bank, trust, or other nominee as a custodian, you are a "beneficial" holder. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
How do I vote my shares? 
[END TABLE]
If you are a "shareholder of record," you can vote your proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• via internet at www.voteproxy.com; 
• via telephone by calling 1-800-PROXIES in the United States or 1-718-921-8500 in foreign countries; 
• by mailing in a signed original of the proxy card that will be sent to you by mail or that you may download from the website referred to in the Notice; or 
• by designating another person to vote your shares with your own form of proxy. 
[END TABLE]
Please refer to the specific instructions set forth on the proxy card.  We encourage you to vote electronically or by telephone.  If you are a "beneficial" holder, your broker, bank, trust or other nominee will provide you with materials and instructions for voting your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Can I vote my shares in person at the annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
If you are a "shareholder of record," you may vote your shares in person at the annual meeting. If you are a "beneficial" holder, you must obtain a proxy from your broker, bank, trust, or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares at the annual meeting.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
What is the Board's recommendation on how I should vote my shares? 
[END TABLE]
Proposal One - The Board recommends you vote your shares FOR the election of each of the two director nominees.
Proposal Two - The Board recommends you vote your shares FOR ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Proposal Three - The Board recommends that you vote your shares FOR approval of the charter amendment to provide for majority voting in the election of directors. 
Proposal Four - The Board recommends you vote your shares FOR the approval of the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies for the foregoing proposals. 
Proposal Five - The Board recommends you vote your shares FOR the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers.
[BEGIN TABLE]
How will my shares be voted if I do not specify how they should be voted? 
[END TABLE]
If you sign and return your proxy card without indicating how you want your shares to be voted, the proxies appointed by the Board will vote your shares FOR the election of  two director nominees, FOR the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; FOR approval of the charter amendment to provide for majority voting in the election of directors; FOR the approval of the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies for the foregoing proposals; and FOR the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Can my broker vote my shares for the proposal regarding the election of directors? 
[END TABLE]
A broker or other entity holding shares for an owner in street name may vote for routine proposals without receiving voting instructions from the owner under certain circumstances. A broker or other entity may vote on non-routine proposals only if the owner has provided voting instructions. A broker non-vote occurs when the broker or other entity is unable to vote on a proposal because the proposal is non-routine and the owner does not provide any voting instructions, at a meeting where the broker or entity is able to vote on a routine matter as well. The only routine matter in this proxy statement is Proposal Two to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Proposals One, Three, Four, and Five to elect the director nominees, approve the charter amendment, approve the adjournment, if necessary or appropriate, to seek additional votes to approve the foregoing proposals, and approve named executive officer compensation, respectively, are non-routine matters. Therefore, if you are a "beneficial" holder and you do not provide specific voting instructions to your broker or other entity on how to cast your vote in respect of the non-routine matters, the broker or other entity will not be able to cast a vote on your behalf with respect to those matters, resulting in so-called broker non-votes on all matters without voting instructions other than Proposal Two.  It is important that you instruct your broker as to how you wish to have your shares voted on each proposal, even if you wish to vote as recommended by the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
How are votes withheld, abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
[END TABLE]
Votes withheld in the election of directors and abstentions are deemed as "present" and entitled to vote at the annual meeting, are counted for purposes of establishing a quorum for the proper conduct of business at the annual meeting, and, except for voting on directors, and the amendment to the charter, will have the same effect as a vote against a matter. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on the election of directors or the amendment to the charter. Broker non-votes, if any, are not relevant for general quorum purposes of establishing a quorum for the proper conduct of business at the annual meeting, are not deemed to be "present" and entitled to vote with respect to any matter for which a broker non-vote is received, and have no effect on the outcome of any of the matters presented at the annual meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
How do I change or revoke my proxy? 
[END TABLE]
After voting you may change your vote one or more times, or you may revoke your proxy, at any time before the vote is taken at the annual meeting.  You may change your vote or revoke your proxy, as applicable, by doing one of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sending a written notice of revocation to our corporate secretary that is received prior to the annual meeting, stating that you revoke your proxy; 
• signing a later-dated proxy card and submitting it so that it is received prior to the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions included in the proxy card(s); 
• voting again via the internet or by telephone using the instructions described in the Notice; or 
• attending the annual meeting and voting your shares in person. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
What vote is required? 
[END TABLE]
With respect to Proposal One to elect the director nominees, a plurality of votes is needed to elect a director. This means that the two nominees for director who receive the most affirmative votes for their election will be elected. Neither a "withhold" vote nor a broker non-vote will count as a vote cast "FOR" a director nominee or have any direct effect on the outcome of the election of directors.
With respect to Proposal Two to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, ratification will be approved by the shareholders if a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter cast their votes in favor of the matter. Abstentions will be treated as a vote cast and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted a vote cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the ratification.
With respect to Proposal Three to approve the charter amendment to provide for majority voting in the election of directors, the amendment will be approved by the shareholders if the votes cast in favor of the matter exceed the votes cast in opposition, Abstentions will be treated as a vote cast, but neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.
With respect to Proposal Four to approve an adjournment of the meeting if deemed necessary or appropriate to solicit additional votes for the charter amendment or other proposals in this proxy statement, the adjournment will be approved by the shareholders if a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter cast their votes in favor of the matter. Abstentions will be treated as a vote cast and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted a vote cast and will have no effect on the outcome of any adjournment.
With respect to Proposal Five to approve the compensation of the names executive officers, we will consider the advisory vote  approved by the shareholders if a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter cast their votes in favor of the matter. Abstentions will be treated as a vote cast and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted a vote cast and will have no effect on the outcome of any adjournment vote.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Who will count the votes? 
[END TABLE]
Representatives from American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC will count the votes and serve as our inspector of election. The inspector of election will be appearing via telephone at the annual meeting.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
[END TABLE]
The rules of the SEC permit shareholders of a company, after timely notice to the company, to present proposals for shareholder action in the company's proxy statement where such proposals are consistent with applicable law, pertain to matters appropriate for shareholder action, and are not properly omitted by company action in accordance with the SEC's proxy rules. Our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders is expected to be held on or about May 2, 2019, and proxy materials in connection with that meeting are expected to be mailed on or about March 22, 2019. The deadline for submission of shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders is November 15, 2019, which is 120 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing date for our proxy materials for this year's annual meeting.

If we do not receive notice of a shareholder proposal within that period of time, such proposal will be considered untimely pursuant to Rules 14a-4 and 14a-5(e) and the persons named in proxies solicited by the Board for our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders may exercise discretionary voting power with respect to such proposal and/or the Chair may consider the matter out of order and not address it at the meeting at all.
