Dear Stockholders: 
I would like to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, to be held at our global headquarters, located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, on Tuesday, May 21, 2019, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The accompanying notice of the Annual Meeting and proxy statement set forth the details regarding admission to the Annual Meeting and the business to be conducted. 
At the Annual Meeting, we will ask you to elect the ten director nominees listed in the proxy statement, consider a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. We will also act upon any other business matters properly brought before the Annual Meeting. The attached proxy statement explains our voting procedures, describes the business we will conduct at the Annual Meeting and provides information about Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company that you should consider when you vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. 
It is important that your shares be represented and voted, regardless of the size of your holdings. Accordingly, whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return a proxy card or, for shares held in "street name," voting instruction form, promptly so that your shares will be represented at the Annual Meeting. You may also access the proxy materials and vote via the Internet as described in the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that you will receive, or vote by telephone. Your proxy is revocable at any time before it is voted and will not affect your right to vote in person if you attend the Annual Meeting. 
I hope to see you at the Annual Meeting. Thank you for your ongoing support of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company. 
Very truly yours, 
John J. Lynch, Jr. 
President and Chief Executive Officer 
125 High Street 
Boston, Massachusetts 02110 
NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TUESDAY, MAY 21, 2019, 8:00 A.M. (EASTERN TIME) 
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company (the "Company") will be held at the Company's global headquarters, located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, on Tuesday, May 21, 2019, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, or at any subsequent time that may be necessary by virtue of any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. The purpose of the Annual Meeting is for the stockholders to consider and vote upon the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  To elect ten (10) directors to the board of directors (the "Board"), each to serve until the  Company's next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  To approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the  Company's named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting  firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  To transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement  thereof.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has fixed the close of business on March 22, 2019 as the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Representation of at least a majority of the voting power represented by all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to constitute a quorum to transact business at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, it is important that your shares be represented at the Annual Meeting. 
We will be using the Securities and Exchange Commission's Notice and Access model ("Notice and Access"), which allows us to deliver proxy materials via the Internet, as the primary means of furnishing proxy materials. We believe Notice and Access provides stockholders with a convenient method to access the proxy materials and vote, while allowing us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing the proxy materials. On or about March 29, 2019, we will mail to stockholders holding shares in "street name" a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (our "2018 Annual Report") online and how to vote via the Internet. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how to receive paper copies of the proxy materials and our 2018 Annual Report. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
William F. Bayers 
Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel 
Boston, Massachusetts 
March 29, 2019 
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT 
We urge you to vote using telephone or Internet voting, if available to you, or if you received these proxy materials by mail, by completing, signing, dating and returning a proxy card or voting instruction form promptly. Please note that if your shares are held by a bank, broker or other recordholder and you wish to vote them at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from that recordholder.

If your Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company shares are held by a broker or nominee (that is, in "street name"), you will need to obtain a voting instruction form from the institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that voting instruction form regarding how to instruct your broker or nominee to vote your shares. If your shares are held in street name at a broker and you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker can vote your shares with respect to "routine" items, but not with respect to "non-routine" items. Proposals 1 and 2 (Election of Directors and Advisory Vote on the Compensation of Named Executive Officers) are non-routine items. Proposal 3 (Ratification of the Appointment of the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) is a routine item. On non-routine items for which you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, the shares will be treated as broker non-votes. 
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU FOR VOTING.

   What We  Don't Do x 
[END TABLE]
GENERAL INFORMATION 
1. When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
Our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") will be held at the Company's global headquarters, located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, on Tuesday, May 21, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, or at any subsequent time that may be necessary by any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. 
2. Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 
We are furnishing you these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of our Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting, including any postponements or adjournments thereof. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide under rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and is designed to assist you in voting your shares. 
3. What is "Notice and Access" and why did the Company elect to use it? 
We are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet under the Notice and Access rules of the SEC. On or about March 29, 2019, we will mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to stockholders who hold shares in "street name" in lieu of mailing a paper copy of the proxy materials. The Notice includes information on how to access and review the proxy materials and how to vote via the Internet. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials by mail or by email. Instructions on how to request a printed copy of the proxy materials may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or by e-mail on an ongoing basis. 
Choosing to access our proxy materials over the Internet or to receive proxy materials by email will decrease costs, expedite distribution of proxy materials to you and reduce our environmental impact. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. 
4. How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
The Notice will provide you with instructions regarding how to: (1) view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; and (2) instruct us to send proxy materials to you by e-mail. The proxy materials are also available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Financial Information." 
5. What is included in the proxy materials? 
The proxy materials include:

• this proxy statement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report").   
[END TABLE]
If you receive a paper copy of these materials by mail, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
6. What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or proxy card or voting instruction form on or about the same time? 
It generally means you hold shares registered in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please sign and return each proxy card or voting instruction form or, if you vote by Internet or telephone, vote once for each Notice or proxy card or voting instruction form that you receive. 
7. Who pays the cost of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting? 
Proxies will be solicited on behalf of the Board by mail, telephone, e-mail or other electronic means or in person, and we will pay the solicitation costs. We will supply our proxy materials, including our 2018 Annual Report, to brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees, or their nominees for the purpose of soliciting proxies from beneficial owners, and we will reimburse such record holders for their reasonable expenses. The Company has retained Georgeson LLC to assist in soliciting proxies in connection with the Annual Meeting, for an estimated fee of up to approximately $22,500, plus expenses. 
8. Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
In accordance with our Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"), the Board has fixed the close of business on March 22, 2019 as the record date (the "Record Date") for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of business on the Record Date, the outstanding number of our voting securities was 124,110,547 shares of common stock. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock he or she held as of the Record Date. Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the holder is present in person or represented by proxy.

[END TABLE]
With respect to Proposal 1, the election of directors, you may vote "FOR" or "WITHHOLD" with respect to each nominee for director. A "plurality" means that the ten director nominees that receive the highest number of votes cast "FOR" will be elected. Stockholders have the option to express dissatisfaction with a nominee by indicating that they wish to "WITHHOLD" authority to vote their shares in favor of the nominee. A substantial number of "WITHHOLD" votes will not prevent a nominee from getting elected, but it can influence future decisions by the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee and the Board concerning nominees. 
With respect to Proposals 2 and 3 (or any other matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting), you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." If you "ABSTAIN" from voting on such proposals, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote. 
11. Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting? 
We are not aware of any matters to properly come before the Annual Meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
12. How does the Board recommend that I vote? 
The Board recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 FOR    The election of the ten (10) director nominees who are named in this proxy statement  to the Board.

14. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Stockholder of Record    You are a "stockholder of record" if, at the close of business on the Record  Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent and registrar.   
 Stockholder of Record    You are a "stockholder of record" if, at the close of business on the Record  Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., our transfer agent and registrar.   
 Beneficial Owner    You are a "beneficial owner" if, at the close  of business on the Record Date, your shares were held by a brokerage firm or other nominee and not in your name. To be a "beneficial owner" means that, like most of our stockholders, your shares are held in "street name." As the  beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or nominee how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions your broker or other nominee provides. If you do not provide your broker or nominee with instructions on how to vote  your shares, your broker or nominee will be able to vote your shares as described in Questions 17 and 18, below.   
[END TABLE]
15. What do I need to be admitted to the Annual Meeting? 
You will need a form of personal identification (such as a driver's license or passport) along with either your Notice, proxy card or proof of stock ownership to enter the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held beneficially in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record and you wish to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you must present proof of your ownership of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement. 
16. Are there other things I should know if I intend to attend the Annual Meeting? 
Please note that no cell phones, tablets, computers, pagers, cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. 
17. What will happen if I do not vote my shares? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Stockholders of  Record      If you are the  stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone, via the Internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting.   
   Stockholders of  Record      If you are the  stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone, via the Internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting.   
   Stockholders of  Record      If you are the  stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone, via the Internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting.   
Beneficial Owners    If you are the beneficial owner and you do not direct  your broker or nominee regarding how to vote your shares, your broker or nominee may vote your shares only on those proposals for which it has discretion to vote. Under applicable stock exchange rules, your broker or nominee generally does not have  discretion to vote your shares on the election of directors, executive compensation proposals and other significant matters and, as such, does not have discretion to vote your shares with regard to Proposals 1 and 2. We believe that  Proposal 3 — ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm — is a routine matter on which brokers and nominees can vote on behalf of their clients, if clients do not furnish voting  instructions.   
[END TABLE]
18. What is the effect of a broker non-vote? 
Subject to applicable stock exchange and SEC rules, brokers or other nominees who hold shares for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals when they have not received voting instructions. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares. Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to certain proposals. Accordingly, a broker non-vote will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum, nor will it impact the outcome of voting on Proposals 1 and 2. Because brokers are entitled to vote on Proposal 3, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes with regard to this proposal. 
19. May I revoke my proxy or change my vote? 
Yes, our By-Laws provide that you may revoke a proxy you have given at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering to our Secretary a letter revoking the proxy, which our Secretary must receive prior to the Annual Meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering to our Secretary a new proxy, bearing a later date than the previous proxy, which our Secretary must receive  prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
Attendance at the Annual Meeting does not, standing alone, constitute your revocation of a proxy. You may change your vote at any time prior to the voting of your shares at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• casting a new vote by telephone or over the Internet by the time and date set forth in Question 13 above; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sending a new proxy card or voting instruction form with a later date that is received prior to the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
20. Where do I send a stockholder proposal for consideration at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders? 
If you wish to propose a matter for consideration at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proposal should be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to our Secretary at the Company's principal executive office, 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. 
For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the proposal must be received by our Secretary at our principal executive office on or before November 30, 2019 by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time. Failure to deliver a proposal in accordance with this procedure may result in it not being deemed timely received. 
Even if a stockholder proposal is not eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8, the proposal may still be offered for consideration at an annual meeting according to the procedures set forth in our By-Laws. A stockholder who wishes to offer a proposal for consideration at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (where such proposal does not otherwise qualify for inclusion in our 2020 proxy statement under Rule 14a-8) may do so by delivering written notice of the proposal to our Secretary, not before January 22, 2020 and not later than February 21, 2020. See "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting" below in this proxy statement. 
21. How can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We expect to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will publish final voting results in a current report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If the official voting results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final voting results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
We maintain corporate governance guidelines (the "Corporate Governance Guidelines") that set forth a flexible framework within which the Board, assisted by its committees, exercises its responsibilities. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide a flexible framework for the conduct of the Board's business and address, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board membership, including size, director independence, membership criteria, and selection of new directors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board leadership structure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board procedures and practices, including meetings, conflicts of interest, director compensation, and performance  assessment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board committees and chairs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management succession planning and review.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Corporate Governance" and are also available in print to any person who requests them by writing to: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, Investor Relations, 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. 
Code of Conduct 
We maintain a code of conduct (the "Code of Conduct") that applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and serves as the foundation of our ethics and compliance program. Included within the Code of Conduct is our Finance Department Code of Ethics, which (in addition to the other provisions of our Code of Conduct) is applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and all other members of our finance department. Any substantive amendments to or waivers from a provision of the Code of Conduct requiring disclosure under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") or the SEC will be disclosed on our website. Under our Code of Conduct, all employees have a duty to report any violation or suspected violation of the policy or law to the appropriate personnel as identified in the policy. 
The Code of Conduct is available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Corporate Governance" and is also available in print to any person who requests it by writing to: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company, Investor Relations, 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. 
Director Independence 
Nasdaq rules provide that a majority of our Board must be comprised of "independent directors". Under applicable Nasdaq rules, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of our Board, that person does not have a relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board has determined that Daniel Allen, L. Gordon Crovitz, Jean S. Desravines, Lawrence K. Fish, Jill A. Greenthal, John F. Killian, John R. McKernan, Jr., E. Rogers Novak, Jr., and Tracey D. Weber are independent directors. 
Our Board has also determined that all of the members of its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee are independent directors as defined under applicable Nasdaq rules and, in the case of all members of the Audit Committee, the independence requirements under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and, in the case of all members of the Compensation Committee, the independence requirements under Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. 
In making such independence determinations for directors (and for members of committees, as applicable), our Board considered the criteria required by applicable Nasdaq rules, including, but not limited to, our relationships with the family members of such directors and companies with which such directors are affiliated and the relationships between our directors (including companies with which they are affiliated) and our independent auditors, as well as Mr. Crovitz having served as our interim President and Chief Executive officer from late September 2016 through mid-April 2017, and the Company's payment of a portion of the compensation of Mr. Fish's executive assistant not attributed to services rendered to the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure 
We currently separate the roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Our President and Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting our strategic direction and our day-to-day leadership and performance, while the Chairman of the Board, who is also an independent director, provides guidance and counsel to our Chief Executive Officer and presides over meetings of the Board. The Board believes that the separation of the two roles appropriately balances the need for our Chief Executive Officer to run our day-to-day operations, with involvement and oversight from the Chairman. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure to determine whether it continues to best serve the Company and our stockholders. 
Committees of the Board 
Our Board has standing Audit, Compensation and Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committees. The standing Board committees are chaired by independent directors, each of whom reports regularly to the Board at Board meetings on the activities and decisions made by the respective committees. The Board makes committee assignments and designates committee chairs based on a director's independence, knowledge and areas of expertise. We believe this structure helps facilitate efficient decision-making and communication among our directors and fosters efficient Board functioning at Board meetings. The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. We describe the current functions and members of each committee below. 
The table below provides current standing committee memberships and 2018 committee meeting information:

Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee Charter sets forth the duties of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company related to internal controls, the audit of the Company's financial statements, and such other matters as required under SEC rules and regulations and Nasdaq listing standards. Among other things, the Audit Committee meets with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to review internal accounting controls and accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee approves the appointment of our independent auditors, reviews and approves the scope of the annual audits of our financial statements, reviews our internal control over financial reporting, reviews and approves any non-audit services performed by the independent auditors, reviews the findings and recommendations of the internal and independent auditors, periodically reviews major accounting policies and oversees and administers our related person transactions policy. 
More detailed description of the functions, duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in its charter, which is available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee Charter sets forth the duties of the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee, in coordination with the Board, evaluates the Chief Executive Officer's performance and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and, in coordination with the Chief Executive Officer, reviews the Chief Executive Officer's evaluation of the other executive leadership team members and approves their compensation, including salary, target annual bonus plan opportunity and long-term incentive program opportunity, and other compensation matters. The Compensation Committee reviews our compensation philosophy and strategy, and considers the material risks associated with the Company's compensation structure, policies and programs as well as mitigating factors. The Compensation Committee also administers incentive compensation and equity-based plans, sets performance targets, metrics and weightings under the Company's incentive compensation and equity-based plans, and reviews other special compensation matters, such as executive employment agreements and other compensatory arrangements, as well as severance and change-in-control arrangements. 
More detailed description of the functions, duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are set forth in its charter, which is available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Independent Compensation Consultants 
The Compensation Committee engages Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") as its compensation consultant to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities under its charter. Semler Brossy advises the Compensation Committee on a broad range of executive compensation matters, including apprising the committee of executive compensation-related trends and developments in the marketplace, informing the committee of regulatory considerations relating to executive compensation, assessing the composition of the Company's compensation peer group companies, providing competitive market data on executive compensation levels, program design and governance features, providing general advice in support of compensation decisions pertaining to our executive leadership team, and reviewing management proposals, documentation and disclosures in support of the committee. In retaining and utilizing Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee considered, among other factors, the independence of the firm according to the factors the committee is required to consider under Rule 10C-1 of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Rule 5605. Semler Brossy does not have any other relationship with or provide any other services to the Company, and the Compensation Committee has determined that the firm is independent and does not have any conflicts of interest with the Company. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The members of the Compensation Committee in 2018 were Messrs. Allen, Fish, Kilian, McKernan and Desravines (who joined the Compensation Committee effective November 13, 2018) and Ms. Weber. None of our executive officers served as a member of the board or compensation committee, or similar committee, of any other company whose executive officer(s) served as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee. 
Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee 
Our Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee Charter sets forth the duties of the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee. The Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to become members of the Board, reviews and makes recommendations on corporate governance guidelines and other policies as well as with respect to the size and structure of the Board, reviews and makes recommendations on director compensation and indemnification arrangements, oversees director orientation and continuing education programs, reviews management succession planning in coordination with the Board, and oversees the evaluation of the Board and its committees. 
More detailed description of the functions, duties and responsibilities of the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee are set forth in its charter, which is available in the "Investors" section of our website at www.hmhco.com under the heading "Corporate Governance." 
Director Nomination Process 
The Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee utilizes a broad approach for identification of director nominees and may seek recommendations from our directors, officers or stockholders and/or engage a search firm. In evaluating and determining whether to ultimately recommend a person as a candidate for election as a director, the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee considers the qualifications set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, including high personal and professional ethics, integrity and values, demonstrated business acumen, experience and ability to use sound judgment to contribute to effective oversight of the business or financial affairs of the Company, strategic planning, diversity and independence from management. It also takes into account specific characteristics and expertise that it believes will enhance the diversity of knowledge, expertise, background and personal characteristics of the Board. Ultimately, the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee seeks to recommend to the Board those nominees whose specific qualities, experience and expertise will augment the current Board's composition and whose past experience evidences that they will: (1) dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent performance of Board duties; (2) comply with the duties and responsibilities set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and in our By-Laws; (3) comply with all duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality applicable to them as directors of publicly traded corporations organized in Delaware; and (4) adhere to our Code of Conduct. 
The Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee considers stockholder recommendations of qualified potential candidates. To have a potential candidate considered by the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee as a nominee for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder must submit the recommendation in writing to the attention of our Secretary at our corporate headquarters no later than February 21, 2020 and no sooner than January 22, 2020. Any such recommendation must include the same information required under our By-Laws for nomination of director candidates by stockholders. 
Stockholders also have the right under our bylaws to nominate director candidates, without any action or recommendation on the part of the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee or our Board, by following the procedures set forth under "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting". 
In December 2016, the Company entered into the Anchorage Nomination Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Allen was appointed to the Board and re-elected to the Board at the 2017 Annual Meeting, as described below under "Related Person Transactions — Anchorage Nomination Agreement." Mr. Allen's nomination for re-election at the 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings was not required under the Anchorage Nomination Agreement. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the Company's risk management strategy and framework consistent with its duty of oversight over the management of the business and affairs of the Company. 
The Audit Committee, under powers delegated to it by the Board, is responsible for discussing with the Company's management the major financial, operational, legal, compliance and other significant risks (including cybersecurity risks), as well as the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies and practices in place. The Audit Committee works directly with members of senior management and the Company's internal audit team to review and assess our risk management initiatives, including the Company's compliance programs, and reports these matters to the Board, as appropriate. In addition, the Audit Committee meets as appropriate: (i) as a committee to discuss the Company's risk management policies and exposures; and (ii) with the Company's independent auditors to review our internal control environment and potential significant risk exposures. 
The Compensation Committee oversees and annually reviews the management of risks relating to our compensation programs and policies. In fulfillment of its duties, the Compensation Committee has direct responsibility for reviewing and approving the compensation of our executive officers and other compensation matters. The Compensation Committee meets regularly with senior management to understand the financial, human resources and stockholder implications of compensation decisions and reports these matters to the Board, as appropriate. 
The Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee oversees the management of risks related to the Company's corporate governance structure and leadership, conflicts of interest and director nomination process. 
The Board engages in the oversight of risk management in various ways. The Board sets goals and standards for the Company's employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the duty of the Board to serve as a prudent fiduciary for stockholders and to oversee the management of the Company. During the course of each year, the Board reviews the structure and operation of various departments and functions of the Company. In these reviews, the Board discusses with management material risks affecting those departments and functions and management's approach to mitigating those risks. The Board reviews and approves management's operating plans and material risks that could affect the results of those operating plans (including cybersecurity risks). In its review and approval of annual reports on Form 10-K, the Board reviews the Company's business and related risks, including as described in the "Business," "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" sections of the reports. The Audit Committee reviews these risks in connection with the preparation of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. When the Board reviews particular transactions and initiatives that require Board approval, or that otherwise merit Board involvement, the Board generally includes related analysis and risk mitigation plans among the matters addressed with senior management. The day-to-day identification and management of risk is the responsibility of the Company's management. As the market environment, industry practices, regulatory requirements and the Company's business evolve, it is expected that senior management and the Board will respond with appropriate risk mitigation strategies and oversight. 
Board Meetings and Annual Meeting Attendance by Board Members 
We expect our directors to attend each meeting of the Board and of the committees on which our directors serve. We also expect our directors to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. During 2018, the Board met 9 times. In 2018, no member of the Board attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of: (i) the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which he or she served as a director); and (ii) the number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served (during the periods that he or she served on any such committee). All of our then-serving directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Executive Sessions 
The Board generally meets in executive sessions as part of every regularly scheduled Board meeting without management directors or any other members of management present unless the Board specifically requests their presence. In addition, the independent directors of the Board meet in executive session without any members of management present at least two times annually, but ideally as part of every regularly scheduled Board meeting, to be consistent with the requirements set forth in the Nasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
The Board has established the following procedure for stockholders to communicate with members of the Board and for all interested parties to communicate with the presiding director or the non-management directors as a group. All such communications should be addressed to the attention of our Secretary at our corporate headquarters, located at 125 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110. The Secretary collects and maintains a log of each such communication and forwards any that the Secretary believes requires immediate attention to the appropriate member or group of members of the Board, who then determines how such communication should be addressed. On a quarterly basis, all of the information is shared with the Chairman of the Board. 
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
We have adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which the Company is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5% stockholders (or their immediate family members), or any entity with which any such person is employed, is a general partner or principal, or has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest, each of whom we refer to as a "related person," has a direct or indirect material interest (a "related person transaction"). 
Our policy provides that, prior to entering into any related person transaction, either the related person or the department head responsible for the potential related person transaction will provide notice to the legal department of the proposed transaction. If the legal department determines that the proposed transaction is a related person transaction, the transaction is presented to the Audit Committee for consideration at the next Audit Committee meeting. If the legal department, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer, determines that it is not practicable or desirable to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting, the transaction is presented to the Chair of the Audit Committee (who possesses delegated authority to act between meetings). The Audit Committee or the Chair considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances available, including (if applicable) but not limited to: the benefits to the Company; the impact on a director's independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediately family member of a director or a related entity of a director; the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the transaction; and the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. The Audit Committee may seek bids, quotes or independent valuations from third parties in connection with assessing any related person transaction. 
The Audit Committee or the Chair approve only those related person transactions that they determine are in the best interests of the Company. The Chair reports to the Audit Committee at the next meeting any approval under this Policy pursuant to delegated authority. 
If the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel becomes aware of a related person transaction that has not been previously reviewed, approved or ratified under the policy, such transaction will be submitted to the Audit Committee or Chair. The Audit Committee or the Chair will review and consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances related to this transaction as described above and evaluate all options, including but not limited to ratification, rescission, amendment or termination of the related person transaction. The Audit Committee periodically reviews any previously approved or ratified related person transactions that remain ongoing. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, the Audit Committee determines if it is in the best interests of the Company to continue, modify or terminate the related person transaction. 
Employment relationships and compensation arrangements between us and our executive officers are not considered related person transactions if they have been reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board. 
Investor Rights Agreement 
In connection with our restructuring, on June 22, 2012, we entered into an investor rights agreement with our new stockholders (the "Investor Rights Agreement"). The Investor Rights Agreement contains, among others, provisions granting our stockholders party thereto from time to time certain registration rights as described in further detail below and provisions related to confidentiality, holdback agreements and our public reporting obligations. 
The Investor Rights Agreement provides our stockholders party thereto from time to time with certain registration rights. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to file and cause to become effective, a shelf registration statement (on Form S-3 if permitted) for the benefit of all stockholders party to the Investor Rights Agreement, and any individual holder or holders of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock can demand an unlimited number of "shelf takedowns," so long as the total offering size is reasonably expected to exceed $100 million. 
Each holder or group of holders who owns at least 15% of our outstanding common stock has: (i) one Form S-1 demand registration right per annum, which may be conducted in an underwritten offering, as long as the total offering size is reasonably expected to exceed $100 million; and (ii) unlimited Form S-3 demand registration rights, which may be conducted in underwritten offerings, as long as the total offering size is reasonably expected to exceed $100 million, each subject to customary cutback provisions. 
Each stockholder party to the Investor Rights Agreement has unlimited piggyback registration rights with respect to underwritten offerings, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. 
The registration rights described above are subject to certain cutback provisions and customary suspension/blackout provisions. We have agreed to pay all registration expenses under the Investor Rights Agreement, except that the selling stockholders may be responsible for their pro rata shares of underwriters' fees, commissions and discounts (subject to the exception described below), stock transfer and certain legal expenses. We are required to pay certain expenses of the selling stockholders, including one firm of legal counsel for the selling stockholders, for any shelf takedown under the shelf registration statement. 
In connection with the registration rights described above, we have agreed to indemnify the stockholders against certain liabilities. The Investor Rights Agreement also contains certain holdback agreements that apply to each stockholder party to the Investor Rights Agreement. Generally, without our prior consent and subject to limited exceptions, the stockholders party to the Investor Rights Agreement have agreed that, if participating in a future shelf takedown or other underwritten public offering, they shall not publicly sell or distribute our equity securities during: (i) the seven-day period prior to the pricing of such offering; and (ii) the 90-day period beginning on such pricing date. 
Anchorage Nomination Agreement 
On December 21, 2016, the Company appointed Daniel Allen, President, Senior Portfolio Manager and partner of Anchorage Capital Group, L.L.C. ("Anchorage"), to the Board and the Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee. The appointment was made pursuant to a nomination agreement the Company entered into with certain affiliates of Anchorage who are stockholders of the Company (the "Anchorage Holders") dated as of December 21, 2016 (the "Anchorage Nomination Agreement"). 
Pursuant to the Anchorage Nomination Agreement, the Company also agreed, among other things (and subject to certain terms and conditions), to include Mr. Allen on the Company's slate of director candidates for re-election at our 2017 Annual Meeting. 
The Anchorage Nomination Agreement contains restrictions on certain actions by the Anchorage Holders that will apply during Mr. Allen's (or a replacement designee's) tenure on the Board (the "Restricted Period"), which restrictions include, among other things and with certain carve-outs, restrictions on: (i) soliciting proxies or initiating a stockholder proposal with respect to the Company; (ii) forming or influencing any "group" (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) with respect to securities of the Company; (iii) acquiring additional shares where it would result in Anchorage beneficially owning more than 20% of the Company's outstanding common stock; (iv) other than in an underwritten widely dispersed public offering, knowingly transferring common stock to any person or group that would beneficially own more than 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock as a result of such transfer; (v) making disparaging public statements regarding the Company or its affiliates (with the Company agreeing to a reciprocal restriction) or making public proposals regarding changes in the Company's business or financial condition; and (vi) initiating legal proceedings against the Company or requesting inspection of the Company's corporate books and records. Additionally, for the duration of the Restricted Period, the Anchorage Holders have agreed to cause all voting securities owned by the Anchorage Holders to, at each Company stockholder meeting, be present for quorum purposes and vote (i) for all directors nominated by the Board for election and (ii) in accordance with the recommendation of the Board on any precatory or non-binding proposals. 
The Anchorage Holders further agreed that, upon Anchorage and its affiliates ceasing to beneficially own at least 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock: (i) the Anchorage Holders would be required to cause Mr. Allen to promptly offer to tender his resignation from the Board and any committee of the Board on which he may be a member and, if requested by the Company, deliver his written resignation, to be effective immediately, to the Board, which shall have sole discretion over whether to accept or reject such resignation; and (ii) the Company's obligations under the Anchorage Nomination Agreement would terminate. Accordingly, on December 21, 2016, Mr. Allen executed and delivered to the Company an irrevocable letter of resignation, effective only upon, and subject to, such time as the Anchorage Holders fall below the foregoing ownership threshold and the Board accepts such resignation. 
Indebtedness 
Affiliates of certain of our stockholders, including stockholders holding 5% or more of our common stock, also currently own a portion of our indebtedness, including indebtedness outstanding under our term loan facility. 
Indemnification Arrangements 
We have entered into agreements with our executive officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our charter documents. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract qualified executive officers and directors. We have purchased a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Nominating, Ethics and Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending non-employee director compensation to the Board for its approval. We pay our non-employee directors a mix of fixed cash compensation and variable equity-based compensation. We do not provide any compensation to Company employee directors or Mr. Allen pursuant to the Anchorage Nomination Agreement for their Board service. The compensation paid to our non-employee directors consists of an annual retainer for service as a member or the Chairman of the Board, of which a portion is paid in cash and a portion in equity, plus an annual cash retainer for service as a member or chair of Board committees, as set forth in the tables below. The Company also reimburses directors for expenses they incur in connection with attending Board and committee meetings. 
Under the Company's non-employee director deferred compensation program ("Deferred Compensation Program"), non-employee directors are permitted to defer receipt of cash and equity-based compensation, with deferred amounts to be paid out either at a specified date or upon the individual's separation from service in accordance with the individual's election. Under the Deferred Compensation Program, deferred cash compensation is deemed to be notionally invested in Company common stock and credited with earnings or losses with respect thereto. Each of Ms. Greenthal and Messrs. Crovitz, Desravines, McKernan and Novak elected to defer 100% of the portion of their compensation for 2018 that was delivered in the form of time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Following the initial year of a director's eligibility to participate in the Deferred Compensation Program for which special rules apply, deferral elections may be made no later than the end of the year prior to the fiscal year in which the compensation is earned. 
The retainers paid to our non-employee directors for service as a member or the Chairman of the Board, a portion of which is paid in cash and a portion of which is paid in equity, in effect as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Executive Summary 
Our Business 
Overview 
HMH is a global learning company committed to delivering integrated solutions that engage learners, empower educators and improve student outcomes. We are organized along two reportable segments: Education and Trade Publishing. Our Education segment focuses on the K-12 educational market, delivering core curriculum instructional materials through our Core Solutions offerings as well as supplemental and intervention solutions and professional services through our Extensions offerings. This reporting segment represented approximately 85% of our annual consolidated net sales in 2018. The K-12 education market is (i) highly cyclical — aligning with pre-determined state schedules for adoption of new instructional materials in which there are peaks and troughs, and (ii) dependent in part on federal, state and local education funding, which is dependent in part on the robustness of their respective finances and levels of funding allocated to such materials. Changes in the adoption schedule, educational funding and our share of the K-12 education market, among other things, can have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial and operational performance. 
For nearly two centuries, our Trade Publishing segment has brought renowned and awarded children's, fiction, nonfiction, culinary, and reference titles to readers throughout the world and represented approximately 15% of our annual consolidated net sales in 2018. The Trade Publishing market is (i) generally a hits driven business for front-list titles and (ii) dependent in part on movie and other current event tie-ins for back-list titles. Changes in public interests, length of time on best seller's and reader's choice lists as well as current tie-ins, among other things, can have a material adverse effect on our Trade Publishing business. 
Completion of 2017 Restructuring Program 
In 2018, we successfully completed our planned restructuring that began in 2017 which has lead to a leaner and more efficient organization with a streamlined cost structure, new executive leadership team and an organizational design in place to work toward achieving our strategic objectives. 
As we previously disclosed, in late 2016, we started working with a third-party consultant to review our operating model and organizational design. In connection with this review, we committed to certain actions under a restructuring program in March 2017 in order to improve our operational efficiency, better focus on the needs of our customers and right-size our cost structure to further support growth initiatives, enhance competitiveness and create long-term stockholder value. These actions included making organizational design changes across layers of the Company and other right-sizing initiatives that resulted in reductions in force and consolidating and/or subletting office space under certain real estate leases. We substantially completed the organizational design change actions in the second quarter of 2017 and completed the remaining actions at the end of 2018. Our annualized run rate cost savings of $72 million as a result of these actions and the implementation of these actions resulted in total charges of $42.8 million, of which $32.6 million resulted in cash outlays. 
2018 - 2020 Strategy 
Our 2018-2020 strategy centers on transforming the Company from a predominately K-12 educational publisher focused on creating great content to a learning company focused on purposeful technology and insight as well as great content to create great outcomes. Our strategy has the following three pillars: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhance and Extend our Core — Strengthen our Core Solutions offerings through differentiated solutions that  link assessment data to instruction, enabling targeted instruction by skills or standards to meet the needs of each student. At the same time, invest in faster-growing, higher margin extensions of the Core Solutions offerings, such as intervention  and supplemental solutions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deliver Integrated Solutions — Leverage the breadth of our Core Solutions and Extensions portfolio and the  reach of our sales force by offering integrated solutions of core, intervention and supplemental solutions and professional services that work in concert to improve student outcomes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Focus on Operational Excellence — Progress toward leaner and more efficient operations and instill a philosophy  of continuous improvement throughout the organization.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we made progress with respect to achievement of these three pillars: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To enhance and extend our Core Solutions offerings we released new next-generation programs in three major subject areas.  We also achieved key adoption milestones with approvals in California for Science and Texas for English Language Arts. We optimized our portfolio long-term growth by divesting all of the assets used primarily in our Riverside clinical and  standardized testing business (the "Riverside Standardized Testing Business") and expanding our Supplemental and Intervention Solutions portfolio through key acquisitions and partnerships.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To develop integrated solutions, we have received positive early feedback from Integrated Solution pilots in select  markets. We also experienced a growth in Services, driven by tighter integration of services with our Core offerings, and launched our blended services offering, which allows us to deliver high-value coaching and professional development both face  to face and online.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In achieving operational excellence, we continue to become a leaner and more efficient organization, completing our  restructuring program in 2018, streamlining our product portfolio and retiring legacy products, and applying Lean Six Sigma training throughout our operations functions.

2018 Company Performance* 
On a consolidated basis, for the second year in a row, the Company delivered on its guidance for full year 2018, with $1.3 billion in net sales, a slight decrease compared to 2017, and $1.3 billion of billings for 2018, a slight increase compared to 2017. 
Our Trade Publishing segment performance was above market in 2018, delivering a net sales increase of $19 million, or 11%, to $200 million from $181 million in 2017. 
Our Education segment net sales performance in 2018 decreased $24 million, or 2%. The decrease was primarily due to Core Solutions net sales, which declined by $57 million, or 10%, in 2018 primarily due to a decline in our addressable K-12 education market coupled with sales related to disciplines reaching the end of their product lifecycles resulting in lower net sales. These declines were partially offset by Extensions offerings, net sales which increased by $33 million, or 6%, in 2018. 
Our performance in 2018 with respect to important Company financial measures (including those forming our guidance and from which financial performance metrics used in our incentive plans are derived) was as follows on a consolidated basis:

Executive Compensation Highlights 
Significant Portion of 2018 NEO Target Total Direct Compensation ("TDC")1 is At-Risk, 
Performance-Based and Long-Term — Emphasizing "Pay for Performance" 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation programs emphasize variable, at-risk  performance-based compensation, which comprised 80% of Mr. Lynch's target TDC opportunity (in the form of annual- and long-term incentive compensation) and 74% on average for our other NEOs, with fixed compensation (base  salary) making up the remainder of target TDC opportunity for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation programs emphasize long-term incentive compensation, which comprised 68% of  Mr. Lynch's target variable, at-risk performance-based compensation opportunity and 67% on average for our other NEOs, with short-term incentive compensation (annual bonus plan) making up the  remainder of their target variable, at-risk performance-based compensation opportunity for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  The charts reflect the value of the 2018 target TDC opportunity as considered by our Compensation Committee as follows  with respect to our CEO and other NEOs: (i) annual salary for 2018; (ii) target 2018 Bonus Plan opportunity; and (ii) the Board approved value for determining the number of time- and performance-based restricted stock units  ("PSUs") under the 2018 LTIP (as defined below) award.  
[END TABLE]
Pay for Performance Philosophy 
We are committed to making sure that our executive compensation programs emphasize our pay for performance philosophy. We establish challenging financial goals in the annual bonus and long-term incentive programs and hold our leadership team to a standard of creating long-term value. 
During 2018, we continued to evolve our business and respond to challenges in the macroeconomic and consumer environment. Under the guidance of our leadership team, corporate performance has improved during the last two years. We acknowledge that there is still much work to be done to continue this progress, and the Committee remains committed to: (i) creating sustainable, long-term value for stockholders, and (ii) aligning the pay outcomes of the Company's bonus and long-term incentive plans with the Company's strategy and performance. 
The Company's pay for performance philosophy is evidenced by the following annual bonus and long-term incentive outcomes in recent years: 
Annual Bonus Plan Payout History. As shown in the chart below, the Company's performance achievement under the Corporate Annual Bonus Plan has resulted in a below target payout in each of the last five years. For participants in the plan, assuming on target individual performance, they have received 58% of their target, on average, over that period. 
2014 - 2018 Corporate Annual Bonus Plan Payout History1 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  Bonus payout includes formulaic payout of the financial component (90% weighting) and assumes a 100% payout on the  individual component (10% weighting) of the Bonus Plan. Thresholds for financial metrics have ranged from 40% to 60% based on the year and the target; weighted average overall payout can be below threshold.  
[END TABLE]
Long-term Incentive Plan Payout History. The Company has completed two long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") cycles, the 2015 LTIP and 2016 LTIP, under the current long-term incentive plan structure that provides NEOs with an award that is 60% performance-based RSUs and 40% time-based RSUs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result of the Company's below-threshold performance relative to its three-year consolidated Billings and Adjusted  cash EBITDA (post plate) objectives under the 2015 LTIP and the Company's below-threshold performance relative to its three-year consolidated Billings and Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") under the 2016 LTIP, all of the  performance-based equity awards granted under the plans were forfeited.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Due to the change in the Company's share price from the date of grant to the final vesting date, the values of the  time-based RSUs portions of the awards for the 2015 LTIP and 2016 LTIP were 34% and 40%, respectively, of the grant date target value1.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result, the total realized value of the 2015 LTIP and 2016 LTIP awards was 14% and 16%, respectively, of the grant  date target value for each award.  
[END TABLE]
2015 and 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan Value Delivery: 
Value Received as a% of Grant Date Value1 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  Value received for each award is measured on the final vesting date  (3rd anniversary of grant date) and accounts for the change in the Company's share price from date of grant until the final vesting date. A pro-rata  portion of the time-based RSU vests each year over the vesting period.

2018 Executive Compensation Actions 
The following are highlights of actions taken with respect to our 2018 executive compensation program and named executive officer compensation as well as the impact of Company performance on executive compensation in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Advisory Vote on 2017 Named Executive Officer Compensation 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal 2017 with over 96% of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote voting in favor. Given this strong support, the Compensation Committee determined to keep a similar overall compensation structure, but in connection with its annual review of our executive compensation programs implemented changes described herein to further support our compensation philosophy and operational and financial goals. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
Our compensation philosophy starts with the premise that employee success + customer success = stockholder success. This philosophy guides development of our compensation programs for employees at all levels of the organization, including our executive leadership team, and fosters our ability to: 
The programs are designed to strike an appropriate balance between driving high levels of performance consistent with the financial objectives of the Company and mitigating against excessive risk taking. 
How We Determine Executive Compensation 
Participants in the Annual Process 
The Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for making compensation decisions for our executive leadership team. The committee makes final decisions with respect to compensation for our named executive officers other than the CEO, and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the CEO's compensation, with the Board making the final decision. As part of the annual executive compensation process, in February of each year the Compensation Committee in coordination with (i) the Board, with respect to the CEO, and (ii) the CEO, with respect to other executive leadership team members, and taking into account analysis and recommendations of the committee's independent compensation consultant ("Independent Compensation Consultant"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews corporate and individual goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive leadership team and  reviews the evaluations of our executive leadership team in light of those goals and objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Role of the Independent Consultant 
The Compensation Committee engages Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC as its Independent Compensation Consultant. The Independent Compensation Consultant advises the Compensation Committee on a broad range of executive compensation and other matters relating to fulfillment of the committee's responsibilities under its charter. As an advisor to the Compensation Committee, the Independent Compensation Consultant, among other things, generally: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Apprises the committee of executive compensation-related trends and developments in the marketplace.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Informs the committee of regulatory considerations relating to executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provides general advice in support of compensation decisions pertaining to our executive leadership team.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews management proposals, documentation and disclosures in support of the committee.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Chief Executive Officer and Other Executive Officers 
Our Chief Executive Officer, in coordination with our Chief People Officer, generally plays an important role in the process for setting compensation for the other executive officers and key employees. The CEO generally: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Develops his individual performance objectives for review with the Compensation Committee in coordination with the Board.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews and approves individual performance objectives of the other executive leadership team members.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

• Makes recommendations on the design, performance metrics, targets and weightings for the current year annual bonus plan and  long-term incentive program in coordination with the Chief Financial Officer and Chief People Officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conducts an annual study of Organization and Talent with the purpose of identifying critical talent at executive levels to  ensure proper succession plans are in place for executive and other critical roles, and to optimize the investment on retention of the highest potential individuals. Similarly, in coordination with the Chief People Officer, recommends actions to  ensure that our executives and people at all levels are highly engaged and that we have a high-performance culture in the company.  
[END TABLE]
All such recommendations of our CEO are subject to Compensation Committee review, adjustment and approval. 
Competitive Market Data and Compensation Peer Group 
How We Use Competitive Market Data 
Our Compensation Committee uses compensation peer group data as a point of reference to assess the competitiveness of executive compensation opportunities; benchmark executive compensation levels, program design and features; evaluate share utilization by reviewing overhang levels and annual burn rates; assist in the design of executive compensation programs; and benchmark executive compensation governance practices and policies. 
The committee also considers general and/or industry-specific survey data for executives whose position, scope and operational or functional responsibilities are not readily available within our compensation peer group for benchmarking purposes. 
2018 Compensation Peer Group 
Our Compensation Committee reviews the composition and appropriateness of our compensation peer group companies annually with the Independent Compensation Consultant, generally seeking to consider companies that are of a comparable size (based on revenue and market capitalization), compete for business, investor capital and/or executive and other key employee talent, and are in the same, related or similar industry as the Company. 
The compensation peer group used for setting 2018 executive compensation consisted of the following 17 companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Peer Group Companies 
 Graham Holdings Company   Pegasystems Inc.   The New York Times Company 
 Graham Holdings Company   Pegasystems Inc.   The New York Times Company 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of setting 2018 executive compensation, we removed Electronic Arts Inc., Hasbro, Inc. and Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. from our prior compensation peer group as we felt these companies are no longer comparable peers, and replaced them with Pegasystems Inc., TripAdvisor, Inc. and Graham Holdings Company as reflected in the above table. In addition, the Compensation Committee also considered technology and publishing industry survey data from Radford, Croner Digital, AAP as well as general industry survey data from Towers Watson, Mercer and AON Hewitt that reflected the revenue scope and operational or functional responsibilities of a particular executive. 
Factors We Consider in Determining Executive Compensation 
In determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee generally considers a variety of factors as it deems appropriate to the circumstance, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive leadership team member's role and responsibilities; qualifications, experience and industry knowledge;  leadership quality and effectiveness; goals and objectives for the relevant performance period; performance during the relevant performance period and future potential; and retention risk;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The competitive market data for similar positions, functions or scopes of responsibility; and internal executive pay  equity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's financial performance, operational budget and three-year plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Input from the Independent Compensation Consultant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other factors as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee considers the components of the executive leadership team member's or other key employee's target total direct compensation (which we define to include annual salary and target annual bonus and long-term incentive program opportunities ("TDC")) and the mix thereof (including with respect to variable performance-based compensation and fixed compensation; short- and long-term compensation; and cash and equity compensation). The Compensation Committee does not apply any specific weighting to these factors, and the relative importance of any one factor may vary among the Company's executive leadership team members depending on, among other things, their relative roles and scopes of responsibility. 
While the Compensation Committee generally views a range around market median as representative of competitive market practice with respect to total direct compensation opportunity, it does not adhere to rigid formulas when determining the amount and mix of compensation elements. 
Key Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program 
Key Elements of Direct Compensation 
Our executive compensation program's direct compensation opportunity primarily consists of the following fixed and variable, performance-based compensation elements:

2018 Target Total Direct Compensation for NEOs 
We believe our emphasis on variable, at-risk performance-based incentive compensation – consisting of annual bonus plan cash awards and long-term incentive program equity awards – aligns our executive leadership team with our business strategy and the long-term interests of our stockholders, providing "pay for performance". 
Significant Portion of 2018 NEO Target TDC1 is At-Risk Performance-Based Compensation 
Our executive compensation programs emphasize variable, at-risk performance-based compensation. With respect to the named executive officers for 2018, variable, at-risk performance-based compensation comprised 80% of Mr. Lynch's target TDC opportunity for his role as our President and Chief Executive Officer and 74% on average of our other named executive officers' target TDC opportunity, with fixed compensation (in the form of base salary) making up the remainder. 
Significant Portion of NEO 2018 At-Risk Performance-Based Compensation is Long-Term 
Our executive compensation programs emphasize long-term incentive compensation. With respect to the named executive officers for 2018, long-term incentive compensation comprised 68% of Mr. Lynch's target variable, at-risk performance-based compensation component of his target TDC for his role as our President and CEO and 67% on average of our other named executive officers' target variable, at-risk performance-based compensation component of their target TDC, with short-term incentive compensation (in the form of our annual bonus plan) comprising 32% for Mr. Lynch as our President and CEO and 33% on average for such other named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  The charts reflect the value of the 2018 target TDC opportunity as considered by our Compensation Committee as follows  with respect to our CEO and other NEOs: (i) annual salary for 2018; (ii) target 2018 Bonus Plan opportunity; and (iii) the Board approved value for determining the number of time- and performance-based RSUs under the 2018 LTIP award.

2017 Special One-Time, Multi-Year Retention Bonus 
In September 2016, in order to help address the immediate retention risk with respect to our executive and other key talent following a series of high-level executive transitions, our Board (as recommended by the Compensation Committee) approved a special one-time cash retention bonus award of $500,000 for each of Messrs. Abbott and Ramsayer and $250,000 for Ms. Else-Mitchell to be paid in two equal installments in September 2017 and 2018, subject to continued employment on each such payment date unless the executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause (as defined in the ELT Severance Plan) or due to death or disability prior to September 22, 2018, in which case payment of the then-unpaid portion of the retention bonus would be accelerated. 
In September 2018, each of Messrs. Abbott and Ramsayer received the second installment of the award in an amount equal to $250,000 and Ms. Else-Mitchell received the second installment of the award in an amount equal to $125,000. 
2018 NEO Variable Compensation – Annual Bonus Plan 
2018 Bonus Plan Overview 
In connection with the Compensation Committee's annual review of the design, performance metrics, targets and weightings for the 2018 Bonus Plan in February 2018, modifications were made to the plan as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Billings metrics were separately established for Core, Heinemann, SIS and Services. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• HMH spend was repositioned from a separate metric to a modifier, which the Compensation Committee can apply to the overall  bonus pool if HMH does not meet the overall spend criteria on Plate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Education and Trade reporting segment-level Adjusted cash EBITDA (before corporate allocations) performance metrics were  added.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company's consolidated Billings and Adjusted cash EBITDA metrics to each of the business unit plans was added.   
[END TABLE]
Consistent with prior years, the total annual bonus plan opportunity for our executive leadership team under the 2018 Bonus Plan was based (i) 90% on the Company's achievement of financial objectives and (ii) 10% on individual performance. 
The 2018 corporate performance metrics included the Company's consolidated Adjusted cash EBITDA and consolidated Billings. The 2018 Bonus Plan included segment metrics for the Education and Trade businesses on billings and Adjusted cash EBITDA (before corporate allocations). Billings metrics were separately established for Core, Heinemann, SIS and Services aspects of the Education segment.
For our named executive officers participating in the 2018 Bonus Plan, achievement of the 90% weighted financial performance metric-based portion of their total annual bonus plan opportunity was determined based on the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Billings (45%)            Adjusted cash EBITDA (45%)   
 Achievement Level    Achievement Percentage (%)      Payout Percentage (%)             Achievement Level      Achievement Percentage (%)      Payout Percentage (%)   
 Maximum      110 and Above        140             Maximum        115 and Above        140   
 Target      100        100             Target        100        100   
 Threshold      90        60             Threshold        85        40   
[END TABLE]
In setting 2018 Bonus Plan targets for financial performance metrics, the Compensation Committee approved targets that were aligned with the Company's performance expectations for such metrics within the Company's operational budget for the year, which is approved by the Board. The committee believed that such targets would be reasonably achievable with strong performance by the Company. 
No payout would be made in respect of a specific financial performance metric unless threshold performance for that metric was achieved. If actual performance was above the maximum performance for that metric, the bonus payout would be capped at the maximum level payout for that metric. Payout for achievement between threshold and maximum would be linearly interpolated. 
With respect to the remaining 10% weighted individual performance-based portion of the plan, payouts for executive leadership team members can range from 0% to 200% of target. As a result, there is no minimum bonus payout amount under the 2018 Bonus Plan, and the total maximum bonus payout under the plan would be 146% of the total target annual bonus plan opportunity. 
NEO 2018 Bonus Plan Awards 
Each of our named executive officers participating in the 2018 Bonus Plan has a specified target annual bonus plan opportunity as a percentage of base salary (generally based on the executive's position and scope of responsibility). In connection with the Compensation Committee's annual review of compensation levels for our named executive officers in February 2018, no changes were made to their respective prior year's target annual bonus plan opportunities. 
The target annual bonus plan opportunities for our NEOs as a percentage of annualized base salaries paid in 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Target Bonus as a Percentage of Annualized Base Salary Paid in 2018

Consistent with the prior year plan, the target long-term incentive plan opportunity for our executive leadership team under the 2018 LTIP consisted of an award of RSUs (i) 60% of which was subject to performance-based vesting PSUs, which vest, if at all, based on the achievement of financial and market objectives, generally subject to continued employment, and (ii) 40% of which was subject to time-based vesting ("time-based RSUs"), which vest ratably over three years subject to continued employment. 
For our named executive officers participating in the 2018 LTIP, vesting of the 60% weighted performance-based RSUs portion of their total long-term incentive plan opportunity is based on achievement of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our three-year cumulative consolidated Billings performance (50%); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our three-year cumulative TSR relative to that of the other companies in the Russell 2000 Index (50%).   
[END TABLE]
Achievement of the 60% weighted performance-based RSUs is determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 3-Year Cumulative Billings (50%)            3-Year Cumulative  TSR (50%)   
  Achievement Level    Achievement Percentage (%)      Payout (vesting) Percentage (%)             Achievement Level    Percentile Ranking (Percentile)      Payout (vesting) Percentage (%)   
 Maximum      110 and Above        150          Maximum      90th and Above        200   
 Target      100        100          Target      50th        100   
 Threshold      80        50          Threshold      30th        50   
[END TABLE]
In setting the 2018 LTIP target for the financial performance metric, the Compensation Committee approved a target that was aligned with the Company's performance expectations for such metric within the Company's three-year plan for the performance period, which is approved by the Board. The committee believed that such target would be reasonably achievable with strong performance by the Company. 
No payout would be made in respect of a specific performance metric unless threshold performance for that metric was achieved. If actual performance was above the maximum performance for that metric, the bonus payout would be capped at the maximum level payout for that metric. Payout for achievement between threshold and maximum would be linearly interpolated. 
NEO 2018 LTIP Awards 
Each of our named executive officers participating in the 2018 LTIP has a specified target long-term incentive plan opportunity (generally based on the executive's position and scope of responsibility). In connection with the Compensation Committee's annual review of compensation levels for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Lynch's long-term incentive target increase of $200,000, which was provided in order to more closely align Mr. Lynch's compensation with peer group median, no changes were made to their respective target long-term incentive plan opportunities for 2018. 
Accordingly, in February 2018 our Compensation Committee / Board approved the following awards of time- and performance-based RSUs under the 2018 LTIP to the named executive officers participating in such plan consistent with their respective target opportunities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

  (1)  The RSUs in this column represent the number of time-based RSUs and the number of the performance-based RSUs tied to  Billings granted to our NEOs participating in the 2018 LTIP calculated based on the closing price of our common stock of $7.00 on February 27, 2018 (which was the date of grant of such RSUs for participating NEOs).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  The RSUs in this column have performance-based vesting conditions in addition to service-based vesting conditions and are  disclosed at the target number of shares subject to the RSUs based on achievement of target level performance. The maximum number of shares that could be delivered to the executive based on above-target level performance with respect to (i) the  three-year cumulative Billings metric is equal to 150% of the target number of shares and (ii) the three-year cumulative TSR metric is equal to 200% of the target number of shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  The RSUs in this column represent the number of the performance-based RSUs tied to TSR granted to our NEOs participating  in the 2018 LTIP calculated based on a Monte Carlo value of $6.68 on February 27, 2018 (which was the date of grant of such RSUs for participating NEOs).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Represents the aggregate award value approved by the Compensation Committee / Board for determining the number of time-  and performance-based RSUs granted to our NEOs participating in the 2018 LTIP, as discussed below.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Company's Equity Grant Policy, the grant date for the 2018 LTIP awards for participating NEOs was February 27, 2018 (representing the third business day following both the date on which the Company first released its earnings information for the reporting period following the Compensation Committee's approval of such awards (fiscal 2017 year-end earnings release)). 
NEO 2016 LTIP Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards Forfeited 
Under the 2016 LTIP, the target long-term incentive plan opportunity for our executive leadership team at the time consisted of an award of restricted stock (i) 60% of which was subject to performance-based vesting ("performance-based Restricted Stock Unit Vesting"), which would vest, if at all, based on the achievement of financial objectives, generally subject to continued employment, and (ii) 40% of which was subject to time-based vesting ("time-based RSUs"), which would vest ratably over three years subject to continued employment. 
For Mr. Ramsayer and Ms. Else-Mitchell, the only named executive officers who were employees on the date of grant and were eligible to participate in the 2016 LTIP, the 60% weighted performance-based RSUs portion of their total long-term incentive plan opportunity vested based on achievement of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our three-year cumulative consolidated Billings performance (50%); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our three-year cumulative consolidated TSR relative to that of other companies in the Russell 2000 Index (50%).   
[END TABLE]
Achievement of the 60% weighted performance-based RSUs would be determined based on achievement levels (from threshold to maximum with corresponding achievement percentages and payout (vesting percentages). No payout (vesting) would be made in respect of a specific performance metric unless threshold performance for that metric was achieved. If actual performance was above the maximum performance for that metric, the bonus payout (vesting percentage) would be capped at the maximum level payout for that metric. Payout (vesting) for achievement between threshold and maximum would be linearly interpolated. 
In setting 2016 LTIP targets for the financial performance metrics, the Compensation Committee approved targets that were aligned with the Company's performance expectations for such metric within the Company's three-year plan for the performance period, which is approved by the Board. The three-year cumulative targets for consolidated Billings set by the committee in February 2016 assumed compounded annual growth rate of 16.2% from the 2015 base year based on the growth in the adoption calendar and other Company strategic initiatives. The Compensation Committee believed that such targets would be reasonably achievable with strong performance by the Company. 
As a result of the Company's below-threshold performance relative to its three-year consolidated Billings and TSR objectives under the 2016 LTIP, the Compensation Committee determined that the awards were not earned and that all of the performance-based RSUs awards granted under the plan would be forfeited. Accordingly, the number of performance-based RSUs awarded at maximum level performance to our NEOs under the 2016 LTIP were forfeited as follows:13,596 shares for Ms. Else-Mitchell and 24,473 shares for Mr. Ramsayer. 
2018 NEO Variable Compensation – Other Equity Awards 
New Hire, Promotional and Retention Equity Awards 
From time to time and on a case by case basis, the Compensation Committee and Board may approve new hire, promotional and/or retention equity awards. In 2018, there were no such NEO new hire, promotional and/or retention equity awards granted to NEOs. 
Other Components of the Executive Compensation Program 
Employee and Certain Executive Level Benefits 
Our executive leadership team and other key employees participate in employee benefit plans generally available to all employees on the same terms, such as our medical and healthcare benefits and our 401(k) plan with a Company matching contribution. We may provide other special benefits that are typically available to executives in the competitive market, but only to the extent that such benefits are reasonable in cost, simple to administer and supportive of our overall business and human resource strategies. 
We provide our executive leadership team with relocation benefits similar to those provided to other eligible employees. The benefits for our executive leadership team include, among other things, travel costs from existing residence, home finding trip, broker assistance, home sale assistance, new residence assistance, temporary living assistance, partner career assistance, reimbursement for transportation, moving expenses and other relocation expenses, in addition to a payment in an amount necessary to cover certain taxes associated with any imputed income arising from such reimbursements. While the Company does not otherwise provide tax gross-ups for its executives, it provides a gross-up for relocation benefits for all employees, including our executives, as we believe that it is integral to our ability to attract key talent whose skills enhance the Company's competitive position. If an executive or other key employee departs voluntarily or is terminated for cause within two years following the date of his or her relocation, that executive or other key employee is required to repay such amounts to the Company, up to 100% if such departure is within the first year and on a monthly pro-rated basis if such departure is more than one year but less than two years after the date of relocation. These benefits are designed to enable us to enhance the overall competitiveness of our executive compensation program and support the attraction and retention of highly skilled executives and other key employees. 
See the "Summary Compensation Table" for further details on the amounts of these and certain additional grandfathered benefits provided to our named executive officers in 2018. 
Severance Arrangements 
Our ELT Severance Plan provides enhanced severance benefits for designated members of our executive leadership team in the event of certain involuntary terminations. The payment of severance benefits under the plan is subject to the Company's receipt of a release of claims and continued compliance with any post-employment restrictions to which the individual is subject. 
In lieu of participating in the ELT Severance Plan, Mr. Lynch is entitled to special severance arrangements in connection with certain involuntary terminations pursuant to the terms of his offer letter. 
See "— Employment Arrangements" and "— Potential Post-Employment Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a description of the terms of these arrangements. 
Employment Arrangements 
The Company has entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Lynch in connection with his appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and, as applicable, promotional letters with our other named executive officers. 
See "— Employment Arrangements" and "— Potential Post-Employment Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a description of the terms of these arrangements. 
Change in Control Protections 
Our Change in Control Severance Plan is designed to retain our designated executive leadership team members and other key employees, align their interests with those of our stockholders so that the executives and other key employees can consider transactions that may be in the best interests of our stockholders, and maintain their focus without concern regarding how any such transaction might personally affect them. The Change in Control Severance Plan provides for "double trigger" severance payments and related benefits, which means that both a change in control and a termination of employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan) must occur in order for a named executive officer's severance benefits to be triggered in connection with a change in control. The payment of severance benefits under the plan is subject to the Company's receipt of a release of claims and continued compliance with any post-employment restrictions to which the individual is subject. 
Pursuant to Mr. Lynch's offer letter he is eligible to participate in the Change in Control Severance Plan at the level of a Tier 1 Employee, except applying the definition of "cause" set forth in his offer letter. 
See "— Employment Arrangements" and "— Potential Post-Employment Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a more detailed description of the benefits payable under the Change in Control Severance Plan and other arrangements. 
Protection with Respect to Equity Arrangements 
In addition to the change in control protections described above, we also provide our executives and other key employees with certain protections with respect to their equity awards in the event of a change in control. With respect to equity grants made under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2015 OIP"), we do not provide single-trigger equity vesting upon a change of control where the acquiring or successor company assumes or substitutes our outstanding equity awards. With respect to these awards, we provide double-trigger accelerated vesting in the event of certain involuntary terminations within 12 months following a change in control. In addition, in the event a termination without cause occurs after at least one third of the performance period is completed, our performance-based restricted stock award and restricted stock unit award agreements provide for pro-rata vesting on the scheduled vesting date based on the number of months of completed service and actual performance achievement. 
In addition to the severance protections described above, (i) Mr. Lynch is entitled to special accelerated vesting of his new-hire equity awards in connection with certain involuntary terminations pursuant to the terms of his offer letter and award agreements, and (ii) Mr. Abbott is also entitled to special accelerated vesting of his new-hire equity awards in connection with certain involuntary terminations pursuant to the terms of an amendment to his awards. 
See "— Employment Arrangements" and "— Potential Post-Employment Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a more detailed description of the benefits payable under the ELT Severance Plan and other arrangements 
Executive Compensation Policies, Practices and Guidelines 
Equity Award Grant Practices 
In accordance with our 2015 OIP, the exercise price of all stock options cannot be less than 100% of the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under the 2015 OIP are subject to such terms, including the exercise price and the conditions of timing of vesting, exercise and expiration, as may be determined by the Compensation Committee except that the maximum term of an option shall generally be no more than ten years after the date of grant. Likewise, the terms and conditions of vesting and expiration of restricted stock and RSUs issued under the 2015 OIP are determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable award agreement. 
Generally, the Company grants equity awards to employees annually during the first quarter of the Company's fiscal year, for which the grant date is the business day that is three business days following the date on which the Company releases its fiscal year-end earnings information following the related approval. From time to time, the Company grants awards to employees outside of the annual grant cycle for various reasons (e.g., promotion, recognition and retention), for which the grant date is the business day that is three business days following the date on which the Company first releases quarterly earnings information following the related award approval (and start date, as applicable). From time to time, the Company also grants awards to newly hired employees as an incentive to join the Company, for which the grant date is the business day that is three business days following the date on which the Company first releases quarterly earnings information following both the new hire's first day of employment and the related award approval. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In November 2018, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted an amended and restated Stock Ownership Policy. The goal of the amended and restated policy is to align the interests of the Company's executive leadership team reporting to the Chief Executive Officer with that of the Company's shareholders by changing the guidelines for share ownership by the Company's executives (and non-employee directors). Our Stock Ownership Policy for our executive leadership team and the Company's non-employee directors requires each covered person to hold a minimum ownership interest in the Company within a specified period of time equal to a multiple of annual base salary (or annual cash retainer, in the case of non-employee directors) as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Covered Person     Ownership Level 
 Chief Executive Officer:    5x annual base salary 
 Chief Financial Officer:    3x annual base salary 
 Executive Vice Presidents:     3x annual base salary 
 Other covered employees:    2x annual base salary 
 Non-employee directors:    3x annual cash retainer 
[END TABLE]
When a covered person has not met the minimum ownership interest, that covered person may not transact in the Company's securities until such ownership interest is met. However, this restriction only applies to shares acquired through the exercise of options or the vesting of time-based or performance-based RSUs after taxes. It does not restrict the disposition of shares acquired by such covered person on the open market so long as such transactions are made in accordance with our Securities Trading Policy. 
Hedging and Pledging 
Our Securities Trading Policy prohibits, among other things, our directors and executive officers from hedging the economic risk associated with the ownership of our common stock and pledging our common stock after the date the policy was adopted. None of our directors or executive officers is engaged in any hedging or pledging transaction involving shares of our common stock. 
Clawback Policy 
Our Clawback Policy allows us to recoup certain excess incentive compensation of certain of our current and former executives and other key employees if erroneously awarded, earned or vested on or after February 17, 2017 during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is subsequently required to prepare a restatement or otherwise concludes to do so based on the achievement of financial results that are the subject of such restatement. While recoupment is not limited to individuals engaged in any misconduct, misconduct may be taken into account under the Compensation Committee's discretionary powers under the policy. The Company will not indemnify any executive for any amounts that have been recouped pursuant to the Clawback Policy. 
In addition, awards under our 2012 Management Incentive Plan ("2012 MIP") and 2015 OIP are subject to clawback and/or forfeiture in the event that recoupment is required by Company policy and/or applicable law. Further, our annual cash incentive plan provides that if, in their sole discretion, the plan administrators determine that during a participant's employment with the Company or its business units, the participant has violated the Company's Code of Conduct or any other Company policy, committed any unlawful or criminal act of moral turpitude, perpetrated a fraud upon the Company, or competed or made preparations to compete with the Company, any bonus under the plan shall be forfeited. 
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups 
We do not provide "gross-ups" for any taxes that might be imposed on an executive with respect to payments in connection with a change in control pursuant to Section 4999 ("golden parachute taxes") or non-compliant deferred compensation arrangements subject to Section 409A of the Code. 
Impact of Tax Considerations 
Prior to December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") was signed into law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") generally limited to $1 million the deduction that a public company could claim in any tax year with respect to compensation paid to each of its CEO and three other named executive officers (other than the CFO), unless such compensation was performance-based as determined under the Section 162(m) regulations. In connection with making fiscal 2017 compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee considered the effect of Section 162(m) and sought to structure certain elements of the compensation program as performance-based compensation which would be exempted from the $1 million limit. 
Under the Tax Act, the performance-based compensation exception has been repealed, subject to certain transition rules. In addition, the Section 162(m) deduction limitation now applies to anyone serving as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer at any time during the tax year and the top three other most highly compensated officers serving on the last day of the tax year. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date. As a result, for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the specified executives will not be deductible, subject to the transition relief. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement with management, and based on this review and discussion, has recommended to the Board that it be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

RISK ASSESSMENT OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS 
The Compensation Committee discussed with members of management our risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs and policies, which focused on potential design risks of our incentive compensation programs and mitigating features of our compensation programs and related policies. 
As part of this assessment, we considered such factors as the mix of fixed and variable compensation, the mix of short- and long-term incentive compensation and the mix of short- and long-term performance-based compensation within our compensation programs. With respect to variable and incentive compensation, we considered the mix of award types, performance measures used, measurement and vesting periods, payout scales, ability to exercise discretion, thresholds and caps. We also considered our governance practices and other risk mitigating policies such as our Code of Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines, internal controls, stock ownership guidelines, hedging and pledging policies, forfeiture provisions and our ability to apply clawbacks to awards to the extent required by Company policy or applicable law (including pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or Nasdaq rules). 
Based on the foregoing, the Compensation Committee does not believe that our compensation programs and policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

  (1)  For Messrs. Abbott and Ramsayer and Ms. Else-Mitchell, these figures for 2018 represent the payment of the second and  final installment of a retention bonus in September 2018. For Mr. O'Neill, this figure represents the payment of a second installment of a signing bonus.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options, time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs, as  applicable, granted during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation (disregarding any forfeiture assumptions). The fair value of the time-based RSUs and the portion of the  performance-based RSUs tied to Billings was calculated based upon our common stock price at the date of grant whereas the fair value of the portion of the performance-based RSUs tied to cumulative TSR was calculated using a Monte Carlo model to  simulate a range of possible future prices for our common stock. For the assumptions made in determining these values, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. These values do not correspond to the actual values that may be realized by our named executive officers for these awards and the grant date fair value of the  performance-based RSUs awards assume target performance is achieved. However, assuming the highest level of performance is achieved with respect to the applicable performance metrics, the maximum possible value of the performance-based RSUs awards  granted to applicable named executive officers in 2018, using the grant date fair value, is as follows for Mr. Lynch, $2,519,993; Mr. Abbott, $1,469,997; Mr. O'Neill, $787,506; Ms. Else-Mitchell, $787,506 and  Mr. Ramsayer, $944,993.

Potential Post-Employment Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Change in Control Severance Plan 
We maintain our Change in Control Severance Plan to help retain executives and other key employees by reducing personal uncertainty that may arise from the possibility of a change in control, and to promote their objectivity and neutrality in evaluating transactions that may be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. The plan establishes objective criteria to determine whether a change in control has occurred, and provides for severance payments and benefits only on a "double trigger" basis. The "double trigger" design is intended to further our goals to retain executive and other key leadership upon a change in control. 
All of our named executive officers are, or while they were employed by the Company were, eligible to participate in the Change in Control Severance Plan. Under this plan, if the executive's employment is (i) terminated by us other than for "cause" (as defined in the 2012 Management Incentive Plan ("2012 MIP") other than for Mr. Lynch, for whom the definition of "cause" is defined in his offer letter) and other than due to death or disability, or (ii) if the executive resigns for "good reason," in either case, within two years after a "change in control" or the period commencing on the date of entry into a definitive agreement or following a public announcement by the Company of a transaction or transactions that would result in a change in control (but not earlier than six months preceding the change in control) (the "Change in Control Protection Period"), then the Company or its successor would be obligated to pay or provide the following benefits upon the employee's execution of a release of claims: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tier I (applicable for Messrs Lynch and Abbott) — A lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) two  times the sum of (a) his or her annual base salary plus (b) his or her target annual bonus, plus (ii) the pro rata portion of the target annual bonus.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tier II (applicable for the other NEOs) — A lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (i) two times his or  her annual base salary, plus (ii) his or her target annual bonus, plus (iii) the pro rata portion of the target annual bonus.  
[END TABLE]
The plan provides for a cutback of severance payments to the safe harbor amount if the payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code but only if such reduction would result in a greater net payment to the executive than he or she would have received without such reduction but after paying the excise tax. 
The term "good reason" generally means (i) material adverse change in duties or reporting relationship, (ii) reduction in salary or annual bonus opportunity not in connection with an across-the-board reduction for other senior executives of the Company or (iii) forced relocation to a place of employment more than fifty miles from the employee's place of employment immediately prior to the change in control; provided, however, that no termination of an employee's employment will constitute a termination for good reason unless (a) the executive has first provided the Company with written notice specifically identifying the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for good reason within thirty days after the executive has or should reasonably be expected to have had knowledge of the occurrence thereof, (b) the Company has not cured such acts or omissions within thirty days of its actual receipt of such notice and (c) the effective date of the employee's termination for good reason occurs no later than ninety days after the initial existence of the facts or circumstances constituting good reason. 
The term "change in control" generally means, unless otherwise provided in any employment agreement between the Company and the applicable employee, the occurrence of any one of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  any person (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than a "permitted holder"  (as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan)), together with its affiliates (other than a permitted holder), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the outstanding common stock or voting power of the  Company by merger, consolidation, reorganization, or otherwise;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, determined on a consolidated basis, to any person or  group (as such term is used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons (other than any permitted holder or their affiliates); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  the Company combines with another company if, immediately after such combination, the stockholders of the Company  immediately prior to the combination hold, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of the capital stock (of any class or classes) having general voting power under ordinary circumstances, in the absence of contingencies, to elect the directors of the  Company of the combined entity; provided, however, that for purposes of this definition, no group will be deemed to have been formed solely by virtue of the execution and delivery of the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Investor Rights  Agreement (each as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan). In addition, the Board may specifically provide that an event or transaction that would not otherwise qualify as a change in control be treated as a change in control for purposes  of the plan.  
[END TABLE]
The term "cause" generally means (i) the executive's commission or guilty plea or plea of no contest to a felony (or its equivalent under applicable law) or any crime that involves moral turpitude, (ii) conduct by the executive that constitutes fraud or embezzlement or any acts of dishonesty in relation to his or her duties with the Company or its affiliates, (iii) the executive having engaged in gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct which causes either reputational or economic harm to the Company or its affiliates, (iv) the executive's continued refusal to substantially perform his or her essential duties with respect to the Company or its affiliates, which refusal is not remedied within ten (10) days after written notice from the Board, or (v) the executive's breach of his or her obligations under any service contract he or she has with the Company or its affiliates or any written Company employment policy, including any code of conduct, which is not cured, if curable, within ten (10) days after the Company notifies the executive of such breach. 
Pursuant to Mr. Lynch's offer letter, his participation in the Change in Control Severance Plan at the level of a Tier 1 Employee applies the definition of "cause" set forth in his offer letter in lieu of the definition included in the Change in Control Severance Plan. For purposes of determining eligibility for any benefits under his offer letter, the Change in Control Severance Plan, any equity award agreement or other arrangement between Mr. Lynch and the Company, "cause" means (i) the executive's guilty plea or plea of no contest to a felony (or its equivalent under applicable law) or any crime that involves moral turpitude, (ii) conduct by the executive that constitutes fraud or embezzlement or any acts of material dishonesty in relation to his duties with the Company or its affiliates that causes or is reasonably expected to cause material harm to the Company or its affiliates, (iii) the executive having engaged in gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct which causes either material reputational or material economic harm to the Company or its affiliates, (iv) the executive's continued refusal to substantially perform his or her essential duties with respect to the Company or its affiliates, which refusal is not remedied within ten (10) days after written notice from the Board, or (v) the executive's material breach of his obligations under any service contract he has with the Company or its affiliates or any written Company employment policy, including the 
Company's formally adopted Code of Conduct, which is not cured, if curable, within ten (10) days after the Company notifies the executive of such breach. 
ELT Severance Plan 
Our ELT Severance Plan provides for enhanced severance protection for eligible executive leadership team members, including Messrs. Abbott, O'Neill and Ramsayer and Ms. Else-Mitchell, in the event of certain involuntary terminations. Under the ELT Severance Plan, if the executive's employment is involuntarily terminated by us for any reason other than for "cause" (as defined in the plan) then the executive would be entitled to (i) severance pay (as further described below), paid in installments in accordance with the executive's regular payroll schedule and (ii) outplacement benefits for a period of 12 months, subject to the executive's execution of a severance agreement (which will include a release of claims and other provisions we deem appropriate, including post-employment obligations). Severance pay (a) for Tier I employees, includes 150% of base salary and (b) for Tier II employees, includes 100% of base salary, in each case, in addition to a pro-rated bonus when bonuses are generally paid to active employees. 
The term "cause" generally means any of the following, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion: (i) engaging in or threatening to engage in conduct detrimental to the best interests of the Company or an affiliate; (ii) theft, embezzlement, fraud, dishonesty or misappropriation of Company property, or misappropriation of a corporate opportunity of the Company or an affiliate; (iii) use or being under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol at work, while working or in any manner that interferes with the performance of his or her job duties; (iv) conviction of, a guilty plea to or nolo contendere or equivalent plea to a felony, or if it results in incarceration, a misdemeanor, and/or his or her conviction of, guilty plea to or nolo contendere or equivalent plea to violation of any federal or state securities laws; (v) misconduct or negligence in connection with the performance of his or her duties; (vi) failure to follow the lawful direction of the person or persons to which he or she reports; or (vii) material breach of the Company's Code of Conduct or Employee Guide, as amended and in effect from time to time, or any successor or similar code(s), standard(s) or policies of ethics or conduct in effect during employment. 
In lieu of participating in the ELT Severance Plan, Mr. Lynch is entitled to special severance arrangements in connection with certain involuntary terminations pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, which arrangements are described below. 
Equity Award Provisions 
Pursuant to the 2015 OIP, if a participant's employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the plan, other than due to death or disability) on or within 12 months following a "change in control" (as defined in the plan), we may provide that: except to the extent otherwise provided in an award agreement, or any applicable employment, consulting, change-in-control, severance or other agreement between a participant and the Company or an affiliate, all stock options and SARs shall become immediately exercisable in full; and the restricted period, with respect to all of the shares of restricted stock awards and RSUs, shall expire immediately. If the vesting or exercisability of any award is subject to the achievement of performance conditions, the portion of the award that may become fully vested and exercisable will be based on the assumed achievement of target performance, which will be determined by the Compensation Committee and prorated based on the number of days elapsed between the grant of the award and termination of employment. Additionally, the Compensation Committee may, upon at least 10 days' notice, cancel any of a participant's outstanding awards and pay such participant, in cash, securities or other property (including of the acquiring or successor company), the value of the participant's awards based upon the price per share received by our other stockholders in the event. 
The term "cause" generally means in the case of a particular award, unless the applicable award agreement states otherwise, the Company or an affiliate having "cause" to terminate the participant's employment or service, (i) as such term is defined in any employment, consulting, change-in-control, severance or any other agreement between the participant and the Company or an affiliate in effect at the time of such termination or (ii) in the absence of any such employment, consulting, change-in-control, severance or any other agreement (or the absence of any definition of "cause" or term of similar import therein), due to the participant's (A) willful misconduct or gross neglect of the participant's duties; (B) having engaged in conduct harmful (whether financially, reputationally or otherwise) to the Company or an affiliate; (C) failure or refusal to perform the participant's duties; (D) conviction of, or guilty or no contest plea to, a felony or any crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude; (E) willful violation of the written policies of the Company or an affiliate; (F) misappropriation or misuse of Company or affiliate funds or property or other act of personal dishonesty in connection with the participant's employment; or (G) willful breach of fiduciary duty. The determination of whether cause exists shall be made by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. 
The term "change in control" generally means in the case of a particular award, unless the applicable award agreement (or any employment, consulting, change-in-control, severance or other agreement between the participant and the Company or an affiliate) states otherwise, any of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 30% or more (on a fully diluted basis) of either (A) the  then outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, including common stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants, the conversion of convertible stock or debt, and the exercise of any similar right to acquire such common stock; or  (B) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); but excluding any acquisition by the Company or any of  its affiliates or by any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates, or by any permitted holder;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  a change in the composition of the Board such that members of the Board during any consecutive 12-month period (the "Incumbent Directors") cease to constitute a majority of the Board. Any person becoming a director through election or nomination for election approved by a valid vote of at least two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors shall be deemed an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that no individual becoming a director as a result  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  the approval by the stockholders of the Company of a plan of complete dissolution or liquidation of the Company; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iv)  the consummation of a reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar form  of corporate transaction involving the Company (a "Business Combination"), or sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company to an entity (other than a permitted holder) that is not  an affiliate of the Company (a "Sale"), unless immediately following such Business Combination or Sale: (A) more than 50% of the total voting power of the entity resulting from such Business Combination or the entity that acquired all  or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company in such Sale (in either case, the "Surviving Company"), or the ultimate parent entity that has beneficial ownership of sufficient voting power to elect a majority of the board  of directors (or analogous governing body) of the Surviving Company (the "Parent Company"), is represented by the Outstanding Company Voting Securities that were outstanding immediately prior to such Business Combination or Sale (or, if  applicable, is represented by shares into which the Outstanding Company Voting Securities were converted pursuant to such Business Combination or Sale), and such voting power among the holders thereof is in substantially the same proportion as the  voting power of the Outstanding Company Voting Securities among the holders thereof immediately prior to the Business Combination or Sale, (B) no person (other than any employee benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Company or  the Parent Company, and other than a permitted holder), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 30% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect members of the board of directors (or  the analogous governing body) of the Parent Company (or, if there is no Parent Company, the Surviving Company) and (C) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors (or the analogous governing body) of the Parent Company (or, if  there is no Parent Company, the Surviving Company) following the consummation of the Business Combination or Sale were Board members at the time of the Board's approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business  Combination or Sale.  
[END TABLE]
2016, 2017 and 2018 LTIP awards were comprised of 40% time-based RSUs and 60% performance-based PSUs. The award agreements for the time-based RSU awards provide that: (i) vesting accelerates if the recipient's employment is terminated without cause (other than due to death or disability) within 12 months following a change in control (or immediately if the award is not assumed or substituted by the successor) and (ii) if the executive is terminated as a result of death or disability, the award will become fully vested. The award agreements for the performance-based PSU awards provide that (i) upon a change in control, the performance based-portion of the award will be converted to a service-based award subject to the original vesting schedule with the remaining unvested portion vesting upon a termination within 12 months of the change in control (or immediately if the award is not assumed or substituted by the successor), (ii) if the executive is terminated by the Company due to death or disability following a change in control, the award will immediately fully vest, but prorated to reflect the number of months employed during the three-year vesting period, (iii) if the executive is terminated by the Company other than for cause, within one year following the occurrence of the change in control, the unvested award will become immediately fully vested, (iv) if the executive is terminated without cause after the first anniversary of the grant date, the performance-based award will vest pro rata based on the number of months employed during the three-year vesting period and actual performance during such period, and (v) if the executive is terminated as a result of death or disability, the award will vest pro rata based on target performance if such event occurs more than one year after the date of grant and 6 months prior to the vesting date or based on actual performance if such event occurs thereafter. 
According to the terms of our 2012 MIP, unless otherwise stated in an award agreement, if a named executive officer's employment is terminated due to their death or disability or for any other reason except by us for "cause" (as defined in the plan), the unvested portion of their equity awards will expire on the date they are terminated. The vested portion of stock option awards will remain exercisable until the earlier of either (i) the expiration of the option period or (ii) 12 months after such termination in the case of termination due to death or disability, 30 days in the case of a voluntary resignation, or generally 90 days, but in certain instances 180 days, after any other termination other than termination by us for cause. If we terminate any named executive officer's employment for cause, both the unvested and vested equity awards will terminate on the same date their employment is terminated. 
In April 2017, Mr. Lynch joined the Company as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to his offer letter, Mr. Lynch was granted a one-time new-hire equity award of (i) time-based RSUs that vest in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, generally subject to continued employment except that the new hire RSUs shall vest immediately in the event of Mr. Lynch's termination without cause (as defined in his offer letter) or resignation for good reason (as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan), and (ii) options to purchase shares of Company common stock that vest in four equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, generally subject to continued employment except that (x) the new hire options shall vest immediately in the event of Mr. Lynch's termination without cause (as defined in the offer letter) or resignation for good reason (as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan), and (y) following Mr. Lynch's termination without cause or resignation for good reason, the vested portion of the new hire options shall remain exercisable for three years rather than 90 days (but in no event later than seven years after the date of grant). 
In November 2016, in recognition of Mr. Abbott's contributions to the Company and to retain his leadership in connection with the departure of our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Linda K. Zecher, from the Company, the Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the new-hire RSU award and new-hire stock option award granted to Mr. Abbott on May 9, 2016 (as described above in "— Employment Arrangements — Joseph P. Abbott, Jr.), to provide that, upon an involuntary termination of his employment by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the 2015 OIP), any unvested portions of such awards shall become immediately fully vested as of such termination and that Mr. Abbott shall have until December 31, 2020 to exercise such options. 
Employment Arrangement for John J. Lynch, Jr. 
Subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of claims (substantially in the form set forth in the Change in Control Severance Plan) within sixty (60) days following any termination of Mr. Lynch's employment by the Company without "cause" (as defined in his offer letter) or as a result of his resignation for "good reason" (as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan), Mr. Lynch is eligible to receive cash severance pay in an amount equal to the sum of (i) 200% of his then current base salary and (ii) his target bonus, generally with half of such amount payable in equal installments paid over a twelve (12) month period in accordance with the Company's standard payroll practices and the remaining half of such payment shall be payable in a single lump sum cash payment on the first anniversary of the termination date. In addition, Mr. Lynch will be entitled to a prorated bonus for the year in which such termination occurs based on actual Company and/or individual performance and calculated based on a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full and partial months completed from the first day of the fiscal year in which such termination occurs through the termination date, and the denominator of which is twelve (12), payable in accordance with the terms of the bonus plan as then in effect for such year. 
Termination Payments 
The table below sets forth the payments each of our named executive officers would have received if their employment had been terminated due to death or disability, by us without cause or by the executive for good reason on December 31, 2018 and there was no change of control. In quantifying potential payments for purposes of this disclosure, we have calculated our equity-based payments by using the closing price of our stock on the last trading day in 2018, which was $8.86.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees. In 2017, we determined our median employee. There were no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during 2018 that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure, and therefore we concluded that we could continue to use the same median employee as last year. The annual total compensation of this median employee for 2018 was $75,876. The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lynch, was $4,185,749 for 2018, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees is 55 to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, enacted as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. Consistent with the results of the advisory vote regarding the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, which was held during our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we have chosen to conduct this advisory vote on an annual basis. Accordingly, the next advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers following the Annual Meeting will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
As described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, we are committed to a total compensation philosophy and structure that provides flexibility in responding to market factors; recognizes and rewards superior performance; aligns our management's interests with those of our long-term stockholders; attracts highly skilled, experienced and capable employees; and is fair and fiscally responsible. 
We ask that you approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement and the related executive compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosures contained herein. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as described under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the related executive compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosures contained in the Company's proxy statement for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not bind us, the Compensation Committee or our Board. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will review the voting results of this non-binding advisory vote and take the voting results into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs and policies. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

SECURITY OWNERSHIP AND OTHER MATTERS 
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The following tables set forth certain information as of March 8, 2019 regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock by: (i) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock; (ii) each director and director nominee of the Company; (iii) each named executive officer; and (iv) all of our current executive officers and directors, as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, each person has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to such shares. As of March 8, 2019, there were a total of 124,063,135 shares of our common stock outstanding, including time-based and performance-based vesting restricted stock. All amounts of performance-based vesting restricted stock are disclosed as outstanding at the maximum payout levels under the applicable award agreements (which assume the highest level of performance under the applicable performance criteria is achieved). 
Beneficial ownership includes shares of common stock for which a person, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting or investment power, or both, and also includes shares of common stock that each such person has the right to acquire within 60 days following March 8, 2019, including upon the exercise of options or warrants or the vesting of RSUs. Where applicable, we calculate the beneficial ownership percentage of a person by including the number of shares of common stock deemed to be beneficially owned by that person (by reason of the right to acquire such shares within 60 days following March 8, 2019) in both the numerator and the denominator that are used for such calculation.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
To provide additional insights into our performance (for a completed period and/or on a forward-looking basis), we have presented consolidated adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash EBITDA and free cash flow as non-GAAP measures. Further, we have presented adjusted cash EBITDA (before corporate allocations) at our segment level. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition to using these non-GAAP measures as compensation performance measures, management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and/or our expected results of operations because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. 
A-2 
Management believes that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to our investors and management as an indicator of our performance that is not affected by: fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates; levels of depreciation or amortization; non-cash charges; fees, expenses or charges relating to acquisition-related activities, including purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and transaction costs, as well as to securities offering- and debt refinancing-activities; charges associated with restructuring and cost saving initiatives, including severance, separation and facility closure costs; certain legal settlements and reimbursements; and non-routine costs and gains. Accordingly, management believes that this measure is useful for comparing our performance from period to period and makes decisions based on it. In addition, targets in adjusted EBITDA (further adjusted to include the change in deferred revenue) are used as performance measures to determine certain incentive compensation of management. Management also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to our investors because management regularly reviews free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by general business operations, excluding capital expenditures, and makes decisions based on it. 
Other companies may define these non-GAAP measures differently and, as a result, our use of these non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash EBITDA and free cash flow used by other companies. Although we use these non-GAAP measures as financial measures to assess our business and as performance measures to determine certain incentive compensation of management, the use of non-GAAP measures is limited as they include and/or do not include certain items not included and/or included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net income or loss prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of performance; and free cash flow should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of liquidity, nor is free cash flow intended to be a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary use. Adjusted cash EBITDA, which despite reference to EBITDA, is not intended to represent an adjusted earnings measure and should not be considered for any purpose other than as a financial performance metric within our 2018 Bonus Plan. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures.
