 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE  ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
[END TABLE]
When And Where Will The Annual Meeting Be Held? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Annual Meeting will be held on April 24, 2019, at Carlisle Inn, located at 4949 Walnut Street, Walnut  Creek, Ohio at 7:00 p.m., local time. To obtain directions to the Annual Meeting location, please contact Ms. Peggy L. Conn at (330) 674-9015.  
[END TABLE]
Why Did I Receive These Proxy Materials? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● You have received these proxy materials because CSBs Board of Directors is soliciting a proxy to vote  your shares at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement contains information that CSB is required to provide to you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) and is intended to assist you in voting your  shares.  
[END TABLE]
Who May Vote At The Annual Meeting? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Only holders of common shares of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 are entitled to receive  notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 1, 2019, there were 2,742,242 common shares, par value $6.25 per share, of the Company outstanding and entitled to vote.  
[END TABLE]
What Is The Difference Between Holding Shares As A "Shareholder Of Record" And As A "Beneficial Owner?" 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the shareholder of record  of those shares. CSB has sent these proxy materials directly to all shareholders of record. Alternatively, if your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other nominee, which is sometimes called  street name, then you are the beneficial owner of those shares, and these proxy materials were forwarded to you by your nominee. The organization holding your shares is the shareholder of record for purposes of voting the  shares at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee how to vote the common shares held in your account by following the voting instructions they provide to you. If you hold your common shares in street  name, you may be eligible to appoint your proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone and may incur costs associated with the electronic access or telephone usage.  
[END TABLE]
How Will My Common Shares Be Voted? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Those common shares represented by a properly executed proxy received prior to the Annual Meeting and not  subsequently revoked will be voted as you direct. If you submit a valid proxy prior to the Annual Meeting but do not complete the voting instructions on the proxy, to the extent permitted by applicable law, your proxy will vote your common shares as  recommended by the Board of Directors, as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    FOR the election of each of the director nominees listed below under PROPOSAL ONE   ELECTION OF DIRECTORS;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    FOR the ratification of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. (Snodgrass) as CSBs  independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 under PROPOSAL TWO  RATIFICATION AND APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    FOR the non-binding, advisory resolution to approve  the compensation of CSBs named executive officers under PROPOSAL THREE ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    FOR THREE YEARS on the advisory resolution to set the frequency of  future advisory votes to approve the compensation of CSBs named executive officers on PROPOSAL FOUR - ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE NON-BINDING RESOLUTIONS TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION  OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  
[END TABLE]
 Will Other Matters Be Decided At The Annual Meeting? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● On the date that this proxy statement was printed, CSB did not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual  Meeting other than those included in this proxy statement. If you submit a valid proxy and other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, then the individuals appointed as proxies will have the discretion to vote on  those matters for you.  
[END TABLE]
May I Revoke My Proxy? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Yes, proxies may be revoked at any time before a vote is taken or the authority granted is otherwise  exercised. Revocation may be accomplished by:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    Executing and delivering a later dated proxy with regard to the same common shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    Giving notice in writing to Ms. Peggy L. Conn, Corporate Secretary, CSB Bancorp, Inc., 91 North Clay  Street, Millersburg, Ohio 44654, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○    Notifying the Corporate Secretary or voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If your shares are held in street name and you wish to revoke your proxy, you should follow the instructions  provided to you by the record holder of your shares. If you wish to revoke your proxy in person at the Annual Meeting, you must bring a legal proxy from the shareholder of record indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on  March 1, 2019. Attending the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
What Constitutes A Quorum? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Under CSBs Code of Regulations, as amended (the Regulations), a quorum for purposes of the  Annual Meeting shall consist of a majority of the voting capital stock of CSB then outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The common shares outstanding are the only shares of CSBs capital stock entitled to vote at the Annual  Meeting. Common shares may be present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. As of March 1, 2019, there were 2,742,242 common shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Consequently, at least 1,371,122 common shares must be  represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Abstentions are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. Street name holders generally cannot  vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the broker, bank or other shareholder of record how to vote their shares using the voting instructions provided by it. If a street name holder does not provide timely instructions, the broker or  other nominee may have the authority to vote on some proposals but not others. If the broker or other nominee does not vote on a proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the  beneficial owner, this results in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes on a matter are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum for the Annual Meeting,  but are not considered entitled to vote on that particular matter. Consequently, broker non-votes generally have no effect on the matter.  
[END TABLE]
Who Pays The Cost Of Proxy Solicitation? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The accompanying proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the Board of Directors of CSB, whose Notice of Annual  Meeting is attached to this proxy statement, and the entire cost of such solicitation will be borne by CSB. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile and electronic mail by directors,  officers and employees of CSB. Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of common shares held of record by such persons, and  CSB will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith.  
[END TABLE]
 What Are The Voting Requirements To Elect the Directors And To Approve the Other Proposals In This Proxy Statement? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Each holder of common shares is entitled to one vote for each common share held on March 1, 2019. At this  time, it is not known whether there will be cumulative voting for the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. The votes required to approve each of the proposals that are scheduled to be presented at the Annual Meeting are as follows:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal One — Election Of Directors 
[END TABLE]
The two director nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. Broker non-votes and proxies marked "Withhold Authority" will not be counted toward the election of directors or toward the election of individual nominees and, thus, will have no effect other than that they will be counted for establishing a quorum. 
Cumulative voting is not available for the other proposals referenced and described in this proxy statement. A shareholder wishing to exercise cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors must notify the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of CSB in writing before 7:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time on April 22, 2019. If cumulative voting is requested and if an announcement of such request is made upon the convening of the Annual Meeting by the Chairman or the Secretary of the Annual Meeting on behalf of the shareholder requesting cumulative voting, you will have a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected, multiplied by the number of common shares owned by you, and will be entitled to distribute your votes among the candidates as you see fit. If any shareholder properly demands cumulative voting for the election of directors at the Annual Meeting, your proxy will give the individuals named on the proxy full discretion and authority to vote cumulatively, and in their sole discretion to allocate votes among any or all of the nominees for director, unless authority to vote for any or all of the nominees is withheld. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal Two — Ratification Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
The proposal to ratify the appointment of CSB's independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the Annual Meeting. This Proposal is considered to be a "routine" matter and, therefore, CSB does not expect any broker non-votes on Proposal Two. Abstentions will be counted as a vote cast and, thus, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Two. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal Three — Approval of the Non-Binding Advisory  Vote on the Compensation of CSB's Named Executive Officers 
[END TABLE]
The proposal to approve the compensation of CSB's named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the majority of the votes cast on the matter at the Annual Meeting. However, because the vote on this matter is advisory, the results will not be binding on the Board of Directors. The Board will review the voting results and will take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Abstentions will be counted as vote cast and, thus, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Three. Broker none-votes will not be counted in determining whether the proposal has been approved.     
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal Four — Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future  Non-Binding Resolutions to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
[END TABLE]
The proposal to approve one of the selections as to the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on the compensation of CSB's named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the Annual Meeting. However, because the vote on this matter is advisory, the results will not be binding on the Board of Directors. The Board will review the voting results and will take them into consideration when making a determination as to how often the advisory vote on executive compensation will take place. Abstentions will be counted as a vote cast and, thus, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal Three. Broker non-votes will not be counted in determining whether the proposal has been approved.  The following table sets forth information as of March 1, 2019, regarding beneficial ownership of the common shares by each director, each director nominee, each of the named executive officers of CSB appearing in the Summary Compensation Table, and all directors, and executive officers of the Company as a group. In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all persons named below can be reached at CSB Bancorp, Inc., 91 North Clay Street, Millersburg, Ohio 44654.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
[END TABLE]
Robert K. Baker is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of CSB. Mr. Baker chairs the meetings of the board of directors and the annual meeting of shareholders. In his role, he has the authority to call meetings of the outside directors and lead executive sessions of the outside directors. Eddie L. Steiner is the Chairman of the Board of the Bank. The Board of Directors believes Mr. Steiner's role is to identify CSB's strategic priorities and lead Board discussions on the execution of Company strategy. The Board of Directors believes that it is beneficial to have an independent Chairman with the sole job of leading the Board, while allowing the President/CEO to focus his efforts on the day to day management of the Company. The separation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's board chair position within its leadership structure appropriately balances the promotion of CSB's strategic development with the Board's management oversight function. The Board of Directors also believes that its leadership structure has created an environment of open and efficient communication between the Board and management, enabling the Board to maintain an active and informed role in governance of risk management by being able to monitor and provide direction on those matters that may present significant risks to CSB. 
The Board of Directors' role in CSB's risk management process includes reviewing regular reports from senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risks. The Board of Directors reviews these reports to enable it to understand and assess CSB's risk environment, risk management and risk mitigation strategies. While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of both management and the Board also have responsibility for risk management. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of CSB's accounting and financial reporting processes. The Compensation Committee oversees the management of risks relating to executive and non-executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Nominating Committee serves in a board governance role and annually reviews the constitution of the Board and its committees, the performance of the Board's committees, and directors with expiring terms. Additionally, the Nominating Committee determines desired and requisite skills and attributes to be represented among directors and authorizes, oversees, and conducts any searches for prospective board members. While each committee oversees certain risks and the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed of such risks through committee reports and discussion in board meetings and executive sessions of the board.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Sessions 
[END TABLE]
The non-employee directors of the Board meet periodically in executive session to discuss issues related to management, personnel and any other matters deemed appropriate by the non-employee directors. During 2018, the non-employee directors meet in executive session four times.

CSB has a Nominating Committee, which recommends to the board the nominees for election as directors. The Nominating Committee will consider candidates for nomination as a director who are recommended by shareholders, directors and other sources.

The Nominating Committee develops and recommends to the Board the Corporate Governance guidelines. The Committee is responsible for the selection of individuals for nomination to the Board of Directors and considering incumbent directors for nomination and re-election.
In considering and evaluating potential candidates for positions on the CSB Board of Directors, and consistent with its charter, the Nominating Committee considers, among other things: (i) the potential candidates' knowledge of the communities in which CSB and the Bank operate; (ii) their experience and any special business, financial, or other expertise; (iii) their reputation for honesty and integrity; and (iv) their ability to provide independent and objective oversight and supervision for matters which may impact CSB and the Bank. The Nominating Committee also considers applicable requirements of CSB's Regulations and requirements of applicable law and regulations with respect to evaluating potential candidates, as well as other matters which the Nominating Committee deems appropriate in light of the specific circumstances and the potential candidate. To that end, the Nominating Committee may conduct its own analysis and may also seek information from a variety of outside sources in order to ascertain whether a potential candidate meets the referenced criteria. 
The Nominating Committee utilizes the same standards and criteria in considering and evaluating potential candidates for positions on the Board of Directors who are recommended by shareholders, when appropriate. The Nominating Committee currently does not have a diversity statement within its charter. Although CSB does not have a specific diversity policy for director candidates, it is the policy of the Nominating Committee that nominees for director should have a diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and skills. Each of the members of the Nominating Committee are "independent," as defined by the NASDAQ listing requirements. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter, which is reviewed annually by the Committee and the Board of Directors and is available on the Company's website at www.csb1.com, under the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Governance Documents tabs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that in order to manage and grow a well-run financial services organization, it is necessary to establish compensation programs and related opportunities that are attractive, motivating and rewarding to high quality executives, managers and staff. These programs and opportunities must be balanced with their cost to CSB and its shareholders. In order to arrive at the appropriate balance, CSB has established the following compensation philosophy and guidelines for its overall compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  In order to attract and retain highly qualified management, CSB strives to provide target base salaries  close to the median of the market rate paid for comparable positions by similarly sized bank holding companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Where practical, CSB establishes performance-based compensation focused on individual results, team results,  and contributions to CSB's overall performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Committee Decision-Making Process 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of CSB's named executive officers and establishes the Company's overall compensation philosophy and objectives. In addition, the Compensation Committee evaluates and assesses the design of CSB's compensation and benefit programs and monitors external market pay levels and practices, in order to determine appropriate compensation adjustments and future compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee also reviews and approves incentive award opportunities, actual bonus payments, award grants and reviews. The Committee recommends to the Board of Directors approval and implementation of material changes to CSB's compensation programs. The Compensation Committee assesses such compensation programs within the context of applicable regulatory guidance, with the goal of establishing appropriate incentives to attract, retain and align executives' interests with established current and long-term objectives of CSB without incenting undue risk. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Outside Executive Compensation Consultants 
[END TABLE]
Neither the Compensation Committee nor management engaged an outside executive compensation consultant in 2018.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Peer Group Evaluation 
[END TABLE]
Total compensation for the named executive officers is comprised of base salaries, annual cash incentive awards, retirement plan contributions, severance protection, long-term equity awards and other benefits and perquisites. To determine compensation levels for the named executive officers, as well as other officers, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation survey data from independent sources to ensure that the total compensation program is competitive. Specifically, during 2018, with the participation of CSB's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee evaluated its pay practices for both directors and the named executive officers including but not limited to comparison against the following similarly situated financial institutions. 
Each of the financial services institutions listed above are publicly-traded institutions ranging in size from approximately $517 million in assets to $2.3 billion in assets, ROAA of 0.81% to 1.34%, ROAE of 6.50% to 14.36%, and are located and doing business primarily in Ohio. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Named Executive Officer Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
The purpose of the base salary program is to pay for the qualifications, experience, and marketability of the position consistent with market practices. A pay range for each position is established around the median of the market rate paid for comparable positions by similarly-sized financial institutions. Individual pay within the range is determined by executive performance, job proficiency and contributions over a period of years. For 2018, the base salary levels for all CSB named executive officers were at or below the median of base salaries of peers in other similar-sized financial organizations. 
Pay adjustments are tied directly to CSB's performance appraisal process, which evaluates the employee on a series of performance criteria. This process is used for all CSB employees, including the named executive officers. Pay adjustments are typically made annually. In addition to these performance-based base pay adjustments, it is periodically necessary to make additional market adjustments in those instances where market base salary levels move faster than anticipated or where additional duties and responsibilities are added to the job. 
Each outside director annually completes a survey of the Chief Executive Officer's performance and objectives for the coming year. The Compensation Committee reviews all director submissions and the Chairman of the Compensation Committee or CSB's board Chairman, or both in concert, then conduct a performance review meeting annually with the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer follows a similar process in annually reviewing the performance of and establishing coming year objectives for each of the Chief Executive Officer's direct reports. 
The amount of a named executive officer's base salary is the reference point for much of the other compensation. For example, the relative ranges of potential annual incentive awards for executives are fairly proportionate to the named executive officers' respective base salaries. In addition, base salary is one component of the contribution formula under CSB's 401(k) and profit sharing plan and the key component in the Company's severance and change in control agreement.  Annual Incentive 
The purpose of the annual incentive program is to focus executives on achieving and possibly exceeding CSB's annual performance objectives consistent with safe and sound operations of the Company and The Commercial & Savings Bank. In 2018, the performance expectations were established around the attainment of specific performance ratios, performance to current year financial plan, and satisfactory compliance with regulatory and audit reviews as well as consideration of the potential impact of executives' actions on safe and sound operations and appropriate risk management controls. 
Each component of the annual incentive program has a separate measurement. Annual incentive opportunities are paid in cash after the attainment of objectives are determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee retains the flexibility to make discretionary adjustments to the bonus payout up or down based on performance that may be subjective. This discretion is not used to change the targets under the plan. 
The target annual incentive opportunity during 2018 was 20-30% of actual base salary for each named executive officer. For 2018, the Company's specific performance ratio was tied to a return on assets at the bank level of 1.30%. The Bank's actual 2018 return on average assets was 1.35%. CSB's budgeted net income was $9.0 million, budgeted return on average assets (ROAA) was 1.24%, budgeted return on average equity (ROAE) was 12.21% and the budgeted efficiency ratio was less than 60.87%. The Company's actual results were as follows: net income $9.4 million, ROAA 1.31%, ROAE 12.89% and efficiency ratio 58.14%. The above actual results equaled 102-106% of plan at CSB. 
Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
CSB maintains The Commercial & Savings Bank 401(k) Retirement Plan, (the "401(k) Plan"), a qualified 401(k) and a profit sharing plan. The 401(k) Plan provides a 100% company match of participant contributions up to a maximum of 4% of each participant's annual qualified compensation. There is also a discretionary profit sharing contribution and the amount may vary directly with CSB profits. The 401(k) Plan provides investment alternatives in the following categories: CSB stock, and the following categories of mutual funds: large, small and mid cap, indexed, growth, bond and money market funds. 
Other Benefits and Perquisites 
All CSB employees, including the named executive officers, are eligible to participate in a comprehensive benefits program, which includes health and welfare, disability, and vacation benefits that are not required to be reported in the tables that follow. Additionally, certain consumer and mortgage loans granted by the Bank to directors, officers and all employees receive a 1% reduction to the standard loan interest rate during the period of service to CSB or the Bank. 
Employment Contracts and Other Arrangements 
An employment agreement dated August 9, 2004, was entered into with Paula J. Meiler providing, among other things, for employment of Ms. Meiler as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CSB and The Commercial & Savings Bank pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The agreement was for a two-year term with annual renewals commencing at the second anniversary, and provides for compensation to Ms. Meiler consisting of an annual base salary of $100,000, a bonus to be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors, vacation, benefits and certain stock options. On August 9, 2007, an amendment to the agreement provided that the agreement be for a two-year term with annual renewals commencing August 9, 2008. In the event that Ms. Meiler's employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the agreement), the agreement entitles her to a severance payment equal to the unpaid amount otherwise due under the agreement plus six months of the base salary in effect on the date of termination and limited continued benefits for a six month period. The agreement also contains a "non-compete" provision, prohibiting Ms. Meiler from competing under terms defined by the agreement for a period of one year following the date of termination of the agreement, as well as a "change in control" provision, which provides Ms. Meiler with certain benefits, including continuation of compensation, stock options, and certain health benefits for stated periods following a "change in control" as defined therein and termination of employment within a 90-day period before or after such "change in control." Such "change in control" benefits are subject to being reduced so that no "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G (b)(l) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) is received by Ms. Meiler.  Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following sets forth the benefits that could be paid to Ms. Meiler upon various termination events, which would only be known at the time that the benefits become payable. 
If Ms. Meiler's employment had been terminated following a "change in control" as of December 31, 2018, Ms. Meiler would have been entitled to a cash severance of $307,600 (2x base salary) and medical benefits of $3,865 (1 year). If Ms. Meiler's employment had been terminated "without cause" as of December 31, 2018, Ms. Meiler would have been entitled to a cash severance of $324,924 (base salary unpaid under the agreement plus 6 months) and medical benefits of $1,933 (6 months). 
Ms. Meiler's employment agreement does not provide for any additional payments or benefits for death, disability, voluntary termination of employment by the executive or involuntary termination by the Company for cause. Under those scenarios, Ms. Meiler is only entitled to her accrued and unpaid obligations, such as salary and unused vacation. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 28, 2018, the last day of our payroll year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. 
After identifying the median employee based on total compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using cash compensation reported on the employee's W-2 for 2018, 401(k) profit sharing, and the 401(k) match. 
The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for our CEO was $329,106 and for our median employee it was $35,806. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median employee for 2018 is 9 to 1. 
Oversight and Risk Management of Compensation Programs 
The Compensation Committee oversees the implementation and enforcement of the policies, procedures and practices related to the various compensation programs as part of its duties. The Compensation Committee monitors the compensation policies to ensure that the compensation packages offered to its employees and executive officers do not present such individuals with the potential to engage in excessive or inappropriate risk taking activities. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the current compensation structure for employees and executive officers does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking to the extent that it would be reasonably likely to lead to a material adverse effect. It is the opinion of the Compensation Committee that the current compensation program appropriately balances risk and the desire to focus on the short-term and the long-term goals of CSB and does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking

 REPORT OF THE AUDIT  COMMITTEE 
[END TABLE]
The following Audit Committee Report is provided in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Commission. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and the Board of Directors of CSB. Management of CSB is responsible for CSB's reporting process, including its system of internal control, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. CSB's auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with S.R.Snodgrass, P.C. ("Snodgrass"), CSB's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018, the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as amended. The Audit Committee also has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants, as required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Snodgrass its independence. Based on the foregoing discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in CSB's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Commission.

 PROPOSAL ONE — ELECTION OF  DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
CSB's Regulations provide that its business shall be managed by a board of directors of not less than three and not more than twenty-five persons, and that such directors shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, and have set terms of three years. In accordance with CSB's Regulations, the Board of Directors has currently established the number of directors at eight. 
The Board of Directors has nominated Jeffery A. Robb, Sr. and Cheryl M. Kirkbride to serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. Mr. Robb and Ms. Kirkbride are each incumbent directors whose present terms expire at the Annual Meeting. 
Mr. Waltman has reached mandatory retirement age and cannot stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. As a result, there will be a vacancy in this class of directors following the Annual Meeting. We thank Mr. Waltman for his eighteen years of dedicated service to CSB and we wish him the best. 
Assuming that at least a majority of the issued and outstanding common shares are present at the Annual Meeting so that a quorum exists, the two nominees for director of CSB receiving the most votes will be elected. Shareholders have the right to vote cumulatively in the election of directors. In order to exercise the right to vote cumulatively, a shareholder must give written notice to the President, a Vice President or the Secretary of CSB not less than forty-eight hours before the time fixed for the Annual Meeting, and the shareholder's demand for cumulative voting must be announced at the commencement of the Annual Meeting by or on behalf of the shareholder. If cumulative voting is elected, a shareholder may cast as many votes in the election of directors as the number of directors to be elected, multiplied by the number of shares held. If cumulative voting is exercised, the proxies named in the proxy card will cast the votes they hold as proxy in a manner to elect as many of the Board's nominees as possible. If one or more of the nominees should, at the time of the Annual Meeting, be unavailable or unable to serve as a director, the common shares represented by proxy will be voted to elect the remaining nominees and any substitute nominees designated by the Board of Directors. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees will be unavailable or unable to serve. 
On pages 11 through 13 of this proxy statement, is a brief statement, as of March 1, 2019, for each nominee for election as a director and for each director whose term will continue after the Annual Meeting, regarding the age, principal occupation or employment, other affiliations and business experience at least during the last five years for such persons. In addition, the following information provides the Nominating Committee's evaluation regarding re-nomination of each of the director nominees and the key attributes, skills, and qualifications presented by each director nominee and the continuing directors. 
The Board Of Directors Recommends That Shareholders Vote "For" The Election Of The Nominees.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected Snodgrass to act as the independent registered public accounting firm to examine the books, records and accounts of CSB and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. This appointment is being presented to shareholders for ratification or rejection at the Annual Meeting. 
Snodgrass was CSB's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and is considered by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors to be well qualified. By NASDAQ and Commission rules and regulations, selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is the direct responsibility of the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has determined, however, to seek shareholder ratification of this selection as both a good corporate practice and to provide shareholders an avenue to express their views on this important matter. 
If shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will seek to understand the reasons for such failure and will take those views into account in this and future appointments of CSB's independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the current selection is ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee reserves the right to terminate the engagement of Snodgrass and appoint a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such change would be in the best interests of CSB and its shareholders. 
Representatives of Snodgrass are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors each recommend a vote "FOR" ratification of the selection of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the independent registered public accounting firm of CSB for the current year.

 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FEES 
[END TABLE]
Fees for professional services rendered by Snodgrass for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were as follows 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Audit Fees (1)     $ 137,088        132,346   
   Audit-Related Fees (2)       11,315        10,976   
   Tax Fees (3)       11,871        11,600   
   All Other Fees      -        -   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Audit fees are fees for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial  statements, the review of financial statements included in Form 10-Q filings and for services normally provided by the independent auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.  Beginning in 2017 the Company was subject to an internal controls audit by an independent registered public accountant, as it had attained market capital of $75 million on June 30, 2017.    
  (2)  Audit-related fees generally include fees for the audit of the Company's employee benefit plan.   
  (3)  Tax service fees consist of compliance fees for the preparation of original tax returns.   
[END TABLE]
All of the above-mentioned services and fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. During CSB's most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were no disagreements with Snodgrass on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.

 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and Section 14A of the Exchange Act enable the shareholders of CSB to vote to approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, the compensation of CSB's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules (this is commonly called a "Say-on-Pay" vote). Accordingly, the following advisory resolution will be submitted for shareholders approval at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CSB Bancorp, Inc. ("CSB") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of CSB's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in CSB's proxy statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to Item 402 of SEC Regulation S-K, including in the "Discussion of Executive Compensation Programs," the "Summary Compensation Table," and the related executive compensation tables, notes and narratives." 
The Board of Directors believes that CSB's compensation policies and procedures, which are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee, are effective in aligning the compensation of CSB's executive officers with CSB's short-term and long-term goals, and that such compensation and incentives are designed to attract, retain and motivate CSB's executive officers who are directly responsible for CSB's continued success. CSB believes that its compensation policies link the interests of its executive officers with the interests of the shareholders and that such policies do not threaten the value of CSB or the investments of CSB's shareholders. Additionally, CSB believes that its executive compensation is reasonable and similar to the executive compensation of financial institutions of similar size and position. 
Shareholders are encouraged to carefully review the information provided in this proxy statement regarding the compensation of CSB's named executive officers in the section captioned "Discussion of Executive Compensation Programs" beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement and the related information on pages 19 through 22. 
Because your vote is non-binding and advisory, the outcome of the vote will not be binding on the Board of Directors. However, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making decisions regarding executive compensation in the future. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that you vote "FOR" approval of the advisory resolution set forth above.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL FOUR – ADVISORY  VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE NON-BINDING RESOLUTIONS TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
[END TABLE]
The Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act require that, not less frequently than once every six-years, a proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders for which the solicitation rules of the Commission require compensation disclosure must also include a separate proposal subject to a shareholder vote to determine whether the advisory shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers will occur every one, two or three years. Currently, shareholder votes to approve the compensation of the named executive officers occur every three years. As a result, we are seeking a non-binding, advisory shareholder vote regarding the frequency of Say-on-Pay advisory votes by shareholders. Accordingly, the following advisory resolution will be submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CSB Bancorp, Inc., approve, on an advisory basis, that an advisory resolution with respect to executive compensation should be presented every year, every two years or every three years, as reflected by their vote for each of these alternatives in connection with this resolution." 
When casting your vote on this resolution, you should mark your proxy for every year, every two years, or every three years based on your preference as to the frequency with which an advisory vote on executive compensation should be held. 
The optimal frequency of the vote is based on a judgment about the relative benefits and burdens of each of the options. Some believe that a less frequent vote would (i) permit shareholders to focus on the overall design of the executive compensation program rather than on the details of individual decisions, (ii) align with the goals of CSB's compensation arrangements which are designed to reward performance that promotes long-term shareholder value, and (iii) avoid the burdens that annual votes may impose on shareholders required to evaluate the compensation program each year. 
Others believe that an annual vote (i) affords shareholders the opportunity to react promptly to emerging trends in compensation and to provide feedback before such trends become pronounced over time and (ii) gives the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors the opportunity to evaluate individual compensation decisions each year in light of shareholder feedback. 
The Board of Directors has carefully considered the various alternatives, and has determined that having a shareholder vote on an advisory resolution regarding executive compensation every three years is in CSB's best interest. Setting the vote for every three years will be the most effective time frame for CSB to respond to shareholder feedback and will provide CSB with sufficient time to engage with shareholders and respond to the results of the advisory vote. 
Because your vote is non-binding and advisory, the outcome of the vote will not be binding on the Board of Directors. However, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making decisions regarding executive compensation in the future. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors recommend an advisory vote for a frequency of "THREE YEARS" for future non-binding resolutions to approve the compensation of the named executive officers of CSB.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
[END TABLE]
CSB has engaged, and intends to continue to engage, in the lending of money through The Commercial & Savings Bank to various directors and officers of CSB and the Bank and their related interests. These loans were made in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to The Commercial & Savings Bank and did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, none of CSB's named executive officers or directors was a member of the Board of Directors of any other company where the relationship would be construed to constitute a committee interlock within the meaning of the rules of the Commission. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSALS BY SHAREHOLDERS FOR  2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
[END TABLE]
In order to be eligible for inclusion in CSB's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, any shareholder's proposal to take action at such meeting must be received at CSB's main office at 91 North Clay Street, Millersburg, Ohio 44654, no later than November 16, 2019. Any such proposal shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
If a shareholder intends to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders without including the proposal in the proxy solicitation materials relating to that meeting, and the proposal is not received by CSB prior to January 30, 2020, then the proxies designated by the Board of Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders may vote the proxies in their discretion on any such proposal without mention of such matter in the proxy solicitation materials or on the proxy card for such meeting.

 SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION WITH  BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Shareholders interested in communicating directly with the Board of Directors may do so by writing to Ms. Peggy L. Conn, Secretary, CSB Bancorp, Inc., 91 North Clay Street, Millersburg, Ohio 44654. The mailing envelope and letter must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Shareholder-Board of Directors Communication." 
The Corporate Secretary will review all such correspondence and regularly forward to the Board of Directors a log and summary of all such correspondence and copies of all correspondence that, in the opinion of the Secretary, deals with the functions of the Board or committees of the Board or that the Corporate Secretary otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time review a log of all correspondence received by CSB that is addressed to members of the Board of Directors and request copies of any such correspondence. Concerns relating to accounting, internal controls or auditing matters are immediately brought to the attention of CSB's internal audit department and handled in accordance with procedures established by the Audit Committee for such matters.
