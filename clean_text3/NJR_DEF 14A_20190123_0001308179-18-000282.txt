Proxy Statement
Annual Meeting of Shareowners January 23, 2019
This Proxy Statement sets forth certain information with respect to the accompanying proxy to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners (the "Meeting") of New Jersey Resources Corporation, or at any adjournments or postponements thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors (the "Board") has designated Eagle Oaks Golf & Country Club, 20 Shore Oaks Drive, Farmingdale, New Jersey 07727, as the place of the Meeting. The Meeting will be called to order at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, January 23, 2019. The Board solicits this proxy and urges you to vote immediately. Unless the context otherwise indicates, reference to "New Jersey Resources," "NJR," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company" means New Jersey Resources Corporation.
The Board is making these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, delivering printed versions of these materials to you by mail. On or about December 13, 2018, we will mail a notice to shareowners containing instructions on how to access the Proxy Statement and Annual Report and how to vote.
Questions and Answers About the Meeting
The Board asks that you vote on the matters listed in the Notice of Annual Meeting, which are more fully described in this Proxy Statement. We are providing this Proxy Statement and related proxy card to our shareowners in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at the Meeting. A proxy, if duly executed and not revoked, will be voted and, if it contains any specific instructions, will be voted in accordance with those instructions.
Only holders of record of outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Common Stock") at the close of business on November 27, 2018, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. At the close of business on November 27, 2018, there were 88,588,988 outstanding shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote.
A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. If you designate someone as your proxy or proxy holder in a written document, that document is called a proxy or a proxy card. Ms. Nancy A. Washington and Mr. Richard Reich have been designated as proxies or proxy holders for the Meeting. Proxies properly executed and received by our Corporate Secretary prior to the Meeting, and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the terms thereof.
A voting instruction is the instruction form you receive from your bank, broker or its nominee if you hold your shares of Common Stock in street name. The instruction form instructs you how to direct your bank, broker or its nominee, as record holder, to vote your shares of Common Stock.
You will be voting on each of the following items of business:
A majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions, withheld votes and shares of record held by a broker or its nominee ("broker shares") that are voted on any matter are included in determining the existence of a quorum. Broker shares that are not voted on any matter will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present.
The election of each nominee for director requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock voted in the election of directors. In addition, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of shareowner votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. For more details regarding the director resignation policy, please see "Election of Directors" on page 11.
The approval of the non-binding advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our named executive officers requires that the votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the number of votes cast against the proposal.
The ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee of Deloitte & Touche LLP requires that the votes cast in favor of the ratification exceed the number of votes cast opposing the ratification.
For the reasons set forth in detail later in this Proxy Statement, the Board recommends that you vote:
Registered shareowners (shareowners who hold Common Stock in their own name registered with our transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., or in certificated form, as opposed to through a bank, broker or other nominee) or employees who hold Common Stock through our NJR Employees' Retirement Savings Plan (our "401(k) Plan") may vote in person at the Meeting or by proxy. There are three ways for registered shareowners and employees who own Common Stock through our 401(k) Plan to vote by proxy:
Registered shareowners and participants in our 401(k) Plan, and any other plans holding shares of Common Stock, are urged to deliver proxies or voting instructions by calling the toll-free telephone number, by using the Internet or by completing and mailing the proxy card or voting instruction. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareowners' and plan participants' identities, to allow shareowners and plan participants to give their proxies or voting instructions and to confirm that such instructions have been properly recorded. Instructions for voting by telephone or over the Internet are included on the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction. If you received your proxy materials via mail, registered shareowners and plan participants may send their proxies or voting instructions by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction and returning it as promptly as possible in the enclosed prepaid envelope.
Shareowners who hold Common Stock through banks, brokers or other nominees ("street name shareowners") who wish to vote at the Meeting should receive voting instructions from the institution that holds their shares. Please contact the institution that holds your shares if you have not received voting instructions. Street name shareowners may also be eligible to vote their shares electronically by following the voting instructions provided by the bank, broker or other nominee that holds the shares, using either the toll-free telephone number or the Internet address provided on the voting instruction; or by completing, dating and signing the voting instruction and returning it promptly in the enclosed prepaid envelope.
The deadline for voting via the Internet or telephone is 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 22, 2019, for shares held directly and 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 17, 2019, for shares held through our 401(k) Plan or any other plans holding shares of Common Stock.
Yes, you can attend the Meeting and vote in person if you are a holder of our Common Stock as of the record date, November 27, 2018. IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING, EACH SHAREOWNER WILL BE ASKED TO PRESENT (I) VALID PICTURE IDENTIFICATION, SUCH AS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR PASSPORT, AND (II) PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS OF THE RECORD DATE, SUCH AS AN ADMISSION TICKET, A BROKERAGE STATEMENT, PROXY CARD OR VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM REFLECTING STOCK OWNERSHIP. TO REQUEST AN ADMISSION TICKET IN ADVANCE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING PLEASE VISIT WWW.PROXYVOTE.COM AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED. However, even if you plan to attend the Meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares by proxy. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices are not permitted at the Meeting.
Shareowners should specify their vote for each matter on the enclosed proxy. The proxies solicited by this Proxy Statement vest in the proxy holders' voting rights with respect to the election of directors (unless the shareowner marks the proxy to withhold that authority) and on all other matters voted upon at the Meeting.
Unless otherwise directed in the enclosed proxy card, the persons named as proxies therein will vote all properly executed, returned and not-revoked proxy cards or voting instruction cards (I) FOR the election of all the proposed director nominees listed thereon; (II) FOR the non-binding advisory resolution regarding approval of the compensation of our named executive officers; and (III) FOR the proposal to ratify the appointment by the Audit Committee of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, with the following two exceptions:
As to any other business that may properly come before the Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction will vote the shares of Common Stock represented by the proxy in the manner as the Board may recommend, or otherwise at the proxy holders' discretion. The Board does not presently know of any other such business.
It will depend on how your ownership of shares of Common Stock is registered. If your shares of Common Stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, your unvoted shares will not be represented at the Meeting and will not count toward the quorum requirement, as explained under "6. How many votes must be present to hold the Meeting?" on page 7, unless you attend the Meeting to vote them in person.
If you own your shares of Common Stock in street name, which means that your shares are registered in the name of your bank, broker or its nominee, your shares may be voted even if you do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") your bank, broker or other nominee may vote your shares in its discretion on "routine" matters. However, NYSE rules do not permit your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares on proposals that are not considered routine. When a proposal is not a routine matter and your bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions with respect to such proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote your shares on that proposal. It is called a "broker non-vote" when a bank, broker or other nominee does not cast a vote for a routine or a non-routine matter.
Please note in the absence of your specific instructions as to how to vote, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to (I) the election of all the proposed director nominees, or (II) the non-binding advisory resolution regarding the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers. Under NYSE rules, these matters are not considered routine matters. Based on NYSE rules, we believe that the ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee of Deloitte & Touche LLP is a routine matter for which brokerage firms may vote on behalf of their clients if no voting instructions are provided. Therefore, if you are a shareowner whose shares of Common Stock are held in street name with a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not return your voting instruction card, your bank, broker or other nominee may vote your shares FOR the ratification of the appointment by the Audit Committee of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Please return your proxy card so your vote can be counted.
Only votes cast "for" or "against" are included in determining the votes cast with respect to any matter presented for consideration at the Meeting. As described above, when brokers do not have discretion to vote or do not exercise such discretion, the inability or failure to vote is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Proxies marked as abstaining, and any proxies returned by brokers as "non-votes" on behalf of shares held in street name because beneficial owners' discretion has been withheld as to one or more matters to be acted upon at the Meeting, will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting. Broker non-votes and withheld votes will not be included in the vote total for the proposal to elect the nominees for director and will not affect the outcome of the vote for the proposal. In addition, under New Jersey corporation law, abstentions are not counted as votes cast on a proposal. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count either in favor of or against (I) the non-binding advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our named executive officers, or (II) the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.
Whether you vote by telephone, Internet or by mail, you may change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (I) submitting a properly signed proxy with a later date, (II) voting by telephone or the Internet at a later time, or (III) voting in person at the Meeting. See the enclosed proxy card for instructions. Attendance at the Meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy.
If you are a shareowner whose stock is held in street name with a bank, broker or other nominee, you must follow the instructions found on the voting instruction card provided by the bank, broker or other nominee, or contact your bank, broker or other nominee to change or revoke your previously given proxy.
NJR will pay all expenses of soliciting proxies, including clerical work, printing and postage. Our officers and other employees may personally solicit proxies or solicit proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile or Internet, but we will not provide compensation for such solicitations. In addition, we have agreed to pay Laurel Hill Proxy Advisory Group, LLC a fee of approximately $6,250, plus reasonable expenses, for proxy solicitation services. We will also reimburse banks, brokers and other persons holding shares in their names, or in the names of nominees, for expenses incurred sending material to beneficial owners and obtaining proxies from beneficial owners.
The Board does not know of any other business that may be brought before the Meeting. However, if any other matters should properly come before the Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters as they, in their discretion, may determine.
We must receive proposals from shareowners, intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, on or before August 15, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and on our proxy/voting instruction card for that meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), and for consideration at that meeting. Shareowners submitting such proposals must be the beneficial owners of shares of the Common Stock amounting to at least $2,000 in market value and must have held such shares for at least one year prior to the date of submission.
Our By-Laws, as amended, also set forth the procedures a shareowner must follow to nominate directors or to bring other business to be considered at shareowner meetings, which will not be included in our Proxy Statements. For a shareowner to nominate a candidate for director at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, we must receive notice of the nomination no later than November 9, 2019. The notice must describe various matters regarding the nominee, including name, address, occupation and shares held. See "Director Nominations and Evaluation Processes" on page 20 for more information regarding the director nomination process. Additionally, under our By-Laws, as amended, for a shareowner to bring other matters before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, we must receive notice no later than November 9, 2019. The notice must include a description of the proposed business, the reasons therefore and other matters specified in our By-Laws, as amended. In each case, the notice must be timely given to our Corporate Secretary, whose address is Office of the Corporate Secretary, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719. A copy of the By-Laws, as amended, is available free of charge on our website at investor.njresources.com under the caption "Corporate Governance." A printed copy is available free of charge to any shareowner who requests it by contacting the Corporate Secretary in writing at Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719.
Election of Directors
The Board currently consists of 12 members divided into three classes with overlapping three-year terms. Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Board shall be divided into three classes, which shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. There is currently an imbalance in the classes of directors, with five directors having terms expiring in 2019, and being nominated for election as directors at the Meeting, three directors with terms expiring in 2020 and four with terms expiring in 2021. In order to address this imbalance, Stephen D. Westhoven, who was appointed by the Board on September 10, 2018, to serve a term expiring at the Meeting, has been nominated to serve a one-year term expiring in 2020, and until his successor is elected and has been qualified. Maureen A. Borkowski, Laurence M. Downes, Robert B. Evans and Thomas C. O'Connor, would each serve for a three-year term expiring in 2022, and until their respective successors are elected and have been qualified.
Each of the nominees is currently serving as a director of the Company and, with the exception of Mr. Westhoven, has been previously elected by our shareowners. There were no nominee recommendations from shareowners submitted in accordance with our By-Laws, as amended. Unless otherwise indicated on a proxy, the proxy holders intend to vote the shares each proxy represents for all nominees for election as directors.
Under New Jersey law, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, however, that any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of shareowner votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. The Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee ("NCGC") will then evaluate the best interests of the Company and will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. Following the Board's determination, the Company will disclose the Board's decision of whether to accept the resignation and an explanation of how the decision was reached.
Proxies solicited by the Board will be voted in favor of the nominees listed below, unless otherwise specified in the proxy. All of the nominees proposed by the Board have consented to serve if elected. We know of no reason why the nominees would not be available for election or, if elected, would be unable to serve. While we do not anticipate that any of the nominees will be unable to serve, if any should be unable to serve, the proxy holders reserve the right to substitute any other person approved by the Board.
The NCGC looks for its current and potential directors collectively to have a mix of skills and qualifications.
We have included a chart following the director biographies below that summarizes the skill set for the full Board. As part of each director's biography, we have included a brief summary of skills and experience. Set forth below is information for each nominee and director concerning the age, principal occupation, employment and directorships during the past five years, positions with the Company, the year in which he or she first became a director of the Company and his or her term of office as a director. Also set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the Board's conclusion that, in light of our business and structure, each nominee and director should serve as a director as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
Summary of Director Qualifications and Experience
We believe effective oversight comes from a Board that represents a diverse range of experience and perspectives that provides the collective qualifications, attributes, skills and experience necessary for sound governance. The NCGC establishes and regularly reviews with the Board the qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that it believes are desirable to be represented on the Board to ensure that they align with the Company's long-term strategy. The most important of these are described below and the number of directors possessing those attributes is indicated:

Director Nominations and Evaluation Processes
Director Candidate Recommendations and Nominations by Shareowners
The NCGC's charter provides that the NCGC will consider qualified director candidate recommendations by shareowners. Shareowner nominees will be evaluated under the same standards as nominees recommended by management or the non-management members of the Board. Recommendations should be sent to Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719. Under our By-Laws, as amended, the Corporate Secretary must receive any nomination for director on or before November 9, 2019 for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. In addition, in accordance with our By-Laws, as amended, any shareowner entitled to vote for the election of directors may nominate persons for election to the Board if such shareowner complies with the procedures set forth in the By-Laws, as amended, and summarized under "Questions and Answers About the Meeting" under Question 19, "How do I make a shareowner proposal for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners?" on page 10. The NCGC did not receive any recommendations from any shareowners in connection with the Meeting.
NCGC Process for Identifying and Evaluating Director Candidates
The NCGC identifies and evaluates all director candidates in accordance with the director qualification standards described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The NCGC evaluates a candidate's qualifications to serve as a member of the Board based on the background and expertise of individual Board members, as well as the background and expertise of the Board as a whole. Nominees are required to bring the skills, talents, knowledge and expertise to ensure that the composition, structure and operation of the Board serves the best interests of our shareowners. In addition, the NCGC will evaluate a candidate's independence and his or her background and expertise in the context of the Board's needs.
Although the NCGC does not have a separate policy regarding diversity, it will consider, in identifying first-time candidates, nominees for director or evaluating individuals recommended by shareowners, the current composition of the Board in light of the diverse communities and geographies we serve and the interplay of the candidate's or nominee's diverse individual experience, education, skills, background and other qualities and attributes with those of the other Board members. To ensure that the Board's composition reflects the particular needs of the Board and the Company, the NCGC incorporates this broad view of diversity into its review and evaluation of new candidates and incumbent nominees in its director nomination process. The NCGC and Board monitor its effectiveness through the Board's self-evaluation process.
Sources of Nominees
The nomination of Mr. Westhoven was made in connection with his appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer of NJR and as part of our succession planning process. Upon the recommendation of the NCGC, on September 10, 2018, the Board appointed Mr. Westhoven, effective immediately. The NCGC is authorized to engage professional search firms at the Company's expense to assist with the identification, evaluation and due diligence on potential nominees for Board vacancies.
Annual Director Performance Evaluations
As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board conducts an evaluation of its performance on an annual basis. The Board has the authority to retain advisors or consultants and to provide for their compensation by the Company, as it shall deem appropriate, to assist in designing and implementing such evaluation. Annually, all Board members participate in a self-assessment that is administered by the NCGC. The self-assessment focuses on the following areas: board structure and leadership, logistics, conduct of the meeting, discharge of board responsibilities, and Board culture and ethics. The Board members are also asked to identify ways to improve the effectiveness of the Board. During fiscal year 2018, the NCGC Chair interviewed each Board member to solicit their views on the Board's performance. The results of the interviews were shared with the NCGC and discussed with the Board. Feedback from the leadership team was also provided to the Board informally at the Board's request. Each of the Audit Committee, NCGC and the LDCC also conduct a self-evaluation administered by their committee chair on an annual basis.
Corporate Governance and Related Matters
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board in accordance with the New Jersey Business Corporation Act and our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, as amended. Members of the Board are kept informed of our business through discussions with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Operating Officer and other officers, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in meetings of the Board and its committees. The corporate governance practices we follow are summarized below.
Board Meetings and Attendance at Annual Meeting of Shareowners
Board Standards of Independence
The Board sets our independence standards ("Company Independence Guidelines") in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The director independence standards, as set forth in the Company Independence Guidelines, provide that a majority of the Board must be independent under the independence standards established by the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the NYSE and the SEC as in effect from time to time. For a Board member or candidate for election to the Board to qualify as independent, the Board must determine that the person and his or her immediate family members do not have a material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us) or any of our affiliates. Under the categorical standards adopted by the Board, a member of the Board is not independent if:
The Board will also consider a director's charitable relationships. Contributions to tax-exempt organizations are not considered payments for purposes of the test in the final bullet point above, provided that we are required to disclose in our annual proxy statement any such contributions made by us to any tax-exempt organization in which any independent director serves as an executive officer if, within the preceding three years, contributions in any single fiscal year from us to the organization exceeded the greater of $1 million, or two percent, of such tax-exempt organization's consolidated gross revenues.
For purposes of the above independence standards, an "immediate family member" includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers-and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person's home. When applying the look-back provisions set forth above, the Board need not consider individuals who are no longer immediate family members as a result of legal separation or divorce, or those who have died or become incapacitated.
A Board member may sit on the board of any of our affiliates if, except for being a director on each such board of directors, the member otherwise meets the independence requirements for each such entity, including the receipt of only ordinary-course compensation for serving as a member of the board of directors. Each member of the Board must submit a letter of resignation to the Chairman of the Board when the member changes his or her principal occupation or employment, or leaves or retires from the business with which such occupation or employment was carried out. The letter will be submitted to the NCGC who will make a recommendation to the Board regarding such director's continued service on the Board. The Board will then determine whether to accept such resignation.
With the exceptions of Mr. Downes, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Westhoven, the President and Chief Operating Officer, the Board has affirmatively determined that each member of the Board is independent in accordance with the above standards. Additionally, we made no contributions during fiscal year 2018 to any charitable organization in which an independent director serves as an executive officer in any single fiscal year within the preceding three fiscal years in an amount in excess of the greater of $1 million, or two percent, of the charitable organization's consolidated gross revenues.
The Company Independence Guidelines are described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and are available free of charge on our website at investor.njresources.com under the caption "Corporate Governance." A printed copy is available free of charge to any shareowner who requests it by contacting the Corporate Secretary in writing at Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719.
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions
Our Board has adopted a written related person transaction policy that governs the review, approval or ratification of covered related person transactions. Our Audit Committee manages this policy. The policy generally provides that we may enter into a related person transaction only if:
In the event our management recommends a related person transaction to the Audit Committee, that transaction must be presented to the Audit Committee for approval. After review, the Audit Committee will approve or disapprove such transaction. Our management will update the Audit Committee as to any material change to the proposed related person transaction at each subsequently scheduled Audit Committee meeting. When our General Counsel, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer or our Chief Financial Officer, determines that it is not practicable or desirable for us to wait until the Audit Committee meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee possesses delegated authority to act on behalf of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee or the Chairman approves only those related person transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests and the best interests of our shareowners, as the Audit Committee or the Chairman determines in good faith.
For purposes of this policy, a "related person transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we (or any of our subsidiaries) were, are or will be a participant, and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. For purposes of determining whether a transaction is a related person transaction, the Audit Committee relies upon Item 404 of Regulation S-K, promulgated under the Exchange Act.
A "related person" is defined as:
There have been no related person transactions or proposed transactions since the beginning of fiscal year 2018 between the Company and our directors or executive officers, either directly or indirectly. Additionally, there are no legal proceedings to which any director, officer, principal shareowner or any affiliate thereof, is a party that would be material and adverse to us.
Board Refreshment and Succession Planning
The Board recognizes the importance of Board refreshment and succession planning to ensure that our directors possess a composite set of skills, experience and qualifications necessary for the Board to successfully establish and oversee management's execution of the Company's strategic priorities (see "Election of Directors" and "Summary of Director Qualifications and Experience" above for a discussion of the key qualifications considered by the NCGC in evaluating candidates). In order to promote thoughtful Board refreshment, the Board adopted a director retirement policy, as discussed below.
Director Retirement Policy
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no director may serve beyond the date of the first annual meeting of shareowners following her or his 75th birthday. Only under extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the Board, may a retired director remain on the Board as a director emeritus.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Board Leadership Structure
As provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board does not have a policy on whether the roles of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board should be separate or, if they are to be separate, whether the Chairman should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee. We currently operate with one individual, Mr. Downes, serving as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board elected Mr. Downes as President and Chief Executive Officer in July 1995 and Chairman of the Board in September 1996. Mr. Downes served as President from 1995 to September 2018 until he was succeeded in that role by Mr. Westhoven as part of the succession planning process. Prior to his election as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Downes served as our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Board believes that because Mr. Downes has unique and extensive experience and understanding of our business, as well as more than 22 years of experience serving on our Board, he is well situated to lead and execute strategic and business plans to maximize shareowner value.
To ensure that the independent directors play a leading role in our current leadership structure, the Board established the position of Lead Director in the Corporate Governance Guidelines in 2003. Mr. Correll currently serves as our Lead Director. In addition, we maintain a significant majority of independent directors (Messrs. Downes and Westhoven, who are executive officers, are the only non-independent directors) and independent Board committees. The Lead Director is in frequent contact with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Operating Officer and is regularly consulted on all material matters. The Lead Director is elected by the independent directors and ensures that the Board operates independently of management and directors and that shareowners have an independent leadership contact.
The Board also has four standing Committees: the Audit Committee, the LDCC, the NCGC and the Executive Committee. Each Committee has a separate chairperson and each committee, other than the Executive Committee, is composed solely of independent directors.
Given our current circumstances and operating strategies, we believe having a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, as well as having a Lead Director and independent standing Board committees, is the most appropriate structure for our shareowners and us. We believe this structure demonstrates clear leadership to our employees, shareowners and other interested parties and eliminates potential for redundancies and confusion. The Lead Director supports the role of the independent directors by providing leadership to the independent directors and working closely with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer.
As part of the Board's annual assessment process, the Board evaluates our board leadership structure to ensure that it remains appropriate. The Board recognizes that there may be circumstances in the future that would lead it to separate the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, but believes that the absence of a policy requiring either the separation or combination of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides the Board with the flexibility to determine the best leadership structure.
Board Review of Committee and Subsidiary Board Roles and Structure
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board is responsible for our risk oversight. Management is responsible for our risk management, including providing oversight and monitoring to ensure our policies are carried out and processes are executed in accordance with our performance goals and risk tolerance. Our management team holds regular meetings that identify, discuss and assess financial risk from current macro-economic, industry and company perspectives. In carrying out its risk oversight function, the Board's four standing committees are responsible for risk oversight within their respective areas of responsibility and each committee regularly reports to the Board. Each of the committee's charters, other than the Executive Committee charter, reflects such responsibilities. Generally, the Board's committees and subsidiary boards of directors oversee the risks as detailed below.
Audit Committee: Responsible for discussing with management our major financial and cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including our risk assessment and risk management policies. In September 2018, the Board also decided to enhance oversight of cybersecurity at the Audit Committee level and also to receive regular technology updates at the Board level. As part of its regular reporting process, management reports and reviews with the Audit Committee our material risks, including, but not limited to, proposed risk factors and other public disclosures, mitigation strategies and our internal controls over financial reporting. In 2018, the Audit Committee continued to focus on cybersecurity risks, receiving regular reports from management on the topic. The Audit Committee also engages in periodic discussions with the Chief Financial Officer and other members of management regarding risks as appropriate. Our internal Risk Management Committee ("RMC") was established by the Audit Committee to develop, implement and enforce risk management procedures for NJRES, NJNG and NJRCEV, and continuously monitors our credit risk management, risks related to trading positions, and trading risk policies and procedures applicable to those entities. The RMC comprises individuals from our affiliated companies that meet approximately once a month and provides periodic reports to the Audit Committee. The RMC's duties include, but are not limited to, evaluating the effectiveness of existing credit policies and procedures, reviewing material transactions and discussing emerging issues.
LDCC: Considers succession planning, human resources risks and risks that may result from our executive compensation programs.
NCGC: Considers risks related to corporate governance structure, policies and practices as well as risks related to environmental stewardship, sustainability and corporate social responsibility.
Each committee regularly reports to the Board. Moreover, the Board reviews and oversees our various financial policies, financing programs, capital and operating plans, benefit plan management, technology projects and certain risk management policies.
Subsidiary Boards: Our several subsidiary boards of directors, which are composed largely of non-management directors, enhance our operational risk oversight. The board of directors of NJNG provides operational and financial risk oversight to that subsidiary, while the boards of directors of NJRES, NJR Energy Investments Corporation and NJRCEV jointly meet periodically and discuss the operational and financial risks of those subsidiaries.
Information About the Board's Committees
The Board has established various committees to assist with the performance of its responsibilities. The information below provides a description of the roles of each committee, as well as membership and meeting information for fiscal year 2018.
The Chairman of the LDCC works with our Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and our Legal Department to establish the agenda for LDCC meetings. The Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and management personnel reporting to her prepare data and materials for review by the LDCC using market data from both broad-based and targeted national and regional compensation surveys. Competitive industry analysis is enhanced through review by the LDCC's outside independent compensation consultant of peer company proxy data, professional research consortia and nationally recognized compensation databases.
The LDCC reviews the performance and compensation of our Chief Executive Officer with input from both the full Board (in the form of written evaluations), and our Chief Executive Officer's self-evaluation. The LDCC approves the compensation of the other executive officers based upon the evaluation and recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer and its own review of each executive officer's individual performance highlights. When it deems appropriate, the LDCC engages its independent compensation consultant or other appropriate advisors to analyze compensation trends and competitiveness of pay packages and to support the LDCC's duty to establish each of the executive officer's targeted overall compensation levels.
Our Board remains focused on its responsibilities in the areas of succession planning and talent development to ensure strong internal leadership capabilities that will support NJR's strategic plan. Each year, the Chief Executive Officer provides a review of the performance and long-term leadership potential of our team, including possible succession candidates for key leadership positions. The Board receives updates throughout the year. The Board engages outside resources as needed to assist with the process. The Board also has in place a confidential plan for emergency succession in the event of the unexpected departure of the Chief Executive Officer.
The LDCC reports regularly to the Board on matters relating to the LDCC's responsibilities. In addition, the LDCC follows regulatory and legislative developments and considers corporate governance best practices in performing its duties. For additional information regarding the compensation-related activities of the LDCC, see the sections entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on page 36 and "Report of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee" on page 60 of this Proxy Statement, respectively.
The LDCC is authorized to retain experts, consultants and other advisors to aid in the discharge of its duties. For fiscal year 2018, the LDCC retained Frederic W. Cook & Co. Inc. ("FW Cook") as its independent compensation consultant. The independent compensation consultant was retained to (I) assist in gathering and analyzing market data, (II) advise the LDCC on compensation standards and trends, (III) provide an annual risk assessment of our compensation policies and (IV) assist in the implementation of policies and programs during fiscal year 2018. In retaining FW Cook, the LDCC separately considered the six factors set forth in Section 10C-1(b)(4) (i) through (vi) of the Exchange Act, and based on such consideration, determined that the work of FW Cook did not raise any conflicts of interest. For a further discussion of the role of FW Cook, please see the section entitled "The Compensation Review Process – Role of Compensation Consultant" on page 41.

A printed copy is available free of charge to any shareowner who requests it by contacting the Corporate Secretary in writing at Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the LDCC was at any time an officer or employee of the Company, or is related to any other member of the LDCC, any other member of the Board or any executive officer of the Company.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Board has adopted the Code of Conduct, a code for all directors, officers and employees, as required by the NYSE rules, which also satisfies the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder by the SEC with respect to our principal executive officer and senior financial officers. The Board has also adopted a Wholesale Trading Code of Conduct, a code applicable to all officers and any employees and agents directly or indirectly involved in the submission of offers or bids to buy or sell natural gas or pipeline or storage capacity (together with the Code of Conduct, the "Codes"). The Codes form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with all corporate policies and procedures, an open relationship among colleagues that contributes to good business conduct and the high integrity level of our employees. The Codes cover all areas of professional conduct, including employment policies, conflicts of interest, intellectual property and the protection of confidential information, as well as strict adherence to all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business. Copies of the Codes are available free of charge on our website at investor.njresources.com under the caption "Corporate Governance." A printed copy is available free of charge to any shareowner who requests it by contacting the Corporate Secretary in writing at Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719.
Communications with the Board
Any shareowner or interested party wishing to communicate with the Lead Director, the non-management directors, any Board committee or specified individual director on an anonymous basis may do so by calling Ethicspoint, Inc., an unaffiliated toll-free hotline service, at 1-866-384-4277 or by submitting a report via its secure web site at www.ethicspoint.com. Ethicspoint, Inc. will then notify the Lead Director or another designated representative of the non-management directors. In addition, any shareowner may communicate in writing to non-management directors by mailing communications to them c/o New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719, Attention: Lead Director. The Lead Director and his duly authorized agents are responsible for collecting and organizing shareowner communications with the Board.
Each credible complaint that is received will be reviewed and investigated by one or more of the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, the Chair of the Audit Committee and/or the Lead Director, or such other person that the Lead Director determines to be appropriate, unless a separate sub-committee of the Board is created to handle the investigation.
Director Compensation
The Board, at the recommendation of the NCGC, sets compensation for directors who are not employees of either the Company or our subsidiaries. The NCGC reviews the form and amount of compensation of non-employee directors at least once a year to ensure that the directors are being compensated appropriately. In November 2017, the NCGC considered a competitive review of director compensation among the Company's peer group companies that was prepared by FW Cook, an independent compensation consultant. See "The Compensation Review Process—Fiscal Year 2018 Peer Group" on page 42 for more information. Based on FW Cook's review, which advised the Board on changes to director compensation in the context of market data, as well as trends and recent developments, the NCGC recommended and the Board approved effective January 1, 2018, an increase to the annual equity retainer, increasing the value of the annual equity retainer from $100,000 to $105,000 (the number of shares to be based upon the closing price of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant).
Compensation for directors who were not officers of the Company or our subsidiaries is detailed in the below table.
In the event of extraordinary circumstances resulting in an excessive number of Board or Committee meetings beyond the typical number of meetings of a Board or Committee in a given year, the Board retains discretion to pay an additional per meeting fee of $1,500 to each attending non-employee director that is a member of such Board or Committee.
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan
Non-employee directors of the Company are eligible to defer up to 100 percent of their Board compensation under the NJR Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan"). This includes the deferral of the payment of annual Board and committee retainers, Board meeting fees and committee meeting fees. At the director's election, deferred amounts are credited to either an "interest account" or a "stock account."
If deferred amounts are credited to a stock account, such account is credited with a number of shares based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the date we allocate such fees (no later than 90 days after the deferred fees would have been paid) and such account is credited with additional shares based on the deemed reinvestment of dividends. An interest account is credited monthly with interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate listed in the Wall Street Journal plus two percent based on the average daily balance credited to the account for that month. The rate is adjusted on a monthly basis. At the election of the participating director, deferred balances in the stock and/or interest accounts are payable after termination of Board service in a lump sum or in installments over a period not to exceed five years after termination of Board service.
The following table presents information relating to total compensation of our non-employee directors for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Non-Employee Director Share Ownership Guidelines
All non-employee directors are required to own shares of our Common Stock with a market value equal to five times the annual cash retainer, to foster a mutual interest between Board members and shareowners of the Company. We expect non-employee Board members to retain at least 50 percent of the Common Stock received from the Company as part of their annual stock retainer until the share ownership requirements are met. These requirements are designed to ensure that non-employee directors acquire and retain a meaningful and significant ownership interest in the Company during their tenure on the Board. All of our non-employee directors are in compliance with these guidelines.
None of the non-employee directors hold stock options. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock held by each non-employee director (including deferred stock) as of September 30, 2018, was as follows:
Stock Ownership
Principal Shareowners
The following table sets forth, as of November 27, 2018, certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock by each person or group we know to beneficially own more than five percent of the outstanding shares of such stock.
Directors and Executive Officers
The following table sets forth, as of November 27, 2018, the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock of each of the directors, each of our executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table below and all of our directors and executive officers as a group. Except as otherwise noted, each person has sole voting and investment power as to his or her shares (or shares such powers with his or her spouse). The beneficial ownership of each director and executive officer is less than one percent of the outstanding shares. The shares owned by all such persons as a group constitute approximately 1.3 percent of the total shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10 percent of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent shareowners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on a review of the copies of these reports furnished to us, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to such officers and directors and greater than 10 percent shareowners were complied with during fiscal year 2018.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
The following table presents information, as of September 30, 2018, with respect to equity compensation plans under which shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This discussion and analysis of our compensation program for named executive officers should be read in conjunction with the tables and text elsewhere in this Proxy Statement that describe the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to the named executive officers.
Executive Summary
The purpose of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis is to explain the process the LDCC of the Board uses to determine compensation and benefits for the following individuals, who are our "named executive officers" for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and to provide the rationale and context for those compensation decisions.
Compensation of our named executive officers is determined under our compensation and benefits program for senior executives, which is governed by the LDCC. Information with respect to the LDCC can be found on page 27 of this Proxy Statement.
The LDCC, which is composed exclusively of independent directors, believes that the shareowner vote confirms the philosophy and objective of linking our executive compensation to performance, our commitment to stakeholders, enhancement of our shareowner value and executive leadership. We view this level of shareowner support as an affirmation of our current pay practices and, as a result, no significant changes were made to our executive compensation pay practices for fiscal year 2018 or 2019. Our Board and the LDCC will continue to consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.
Our Guiding Philosophy
Our compensation philosophy is guided by the principle of pay-for-performance. While aligning each executive's compensation with our short-term and long-term business goals, we aim to provide the incentives needed to attract, motivate, reward and retain our management talent, which is crucial to our long-term success.
Developments in our Executive Compensation Program for Fiscal Year 2018
During fiscal year 2018, we undertook our annual review of our executive compensation practices to ensure that our plans and practices were supportive of the goals of the organization, competitive with industry practice and in keeping with the best interests of our shareowners. As a result of that review, the LDCC made no significant changes to the executive compensation program for fiscal year 2018, which featured the following:
The long-term equity incentive award program also provides us with the ability under the 2017 Plan to grant deferred retention stock unit awards, which we use from time to time as performance recognition awards that reward outstanding performance while encouraging retention of key executives. Deferred retention stock unit awards were granted in fiscal year 2019 with respect to 2018 performance as described in more detail under "Deferred Retention Stock Unit Awards to NEOs" on page 51.
To implement our pay-for-performance philosophy, the LDCC attempts to set reasonable but rigorous goals for our OIP and performance shares granted to our named executive officers.
Fiscal Year 2018 Performance Highlights
New Jersey Resources (NJR)
New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG)
NJR Energy Services (NJRES)
NJR Clean Energy Ventures (NJRCEV)
NJR Midstream (Midstream)
NJR Home Services (NJRHS)
Our Pay-for-Performance Link
Our outstanding financial and operational performance in fiscal year 2018 resulted in annual short-term incentive award payouts to our named executive officers ranging from 140.5 percent to 145.5 percent of their respective target award amounts under our 2018 OIP. The exceptional results in 2018 were aided in part by the leadership of our named executive officers that positioned NJR to capitalize on market opportunities by maintaining a strong financial profile that could be utilized to generate greater NFE this past year. Our strong operational execution was also reflected by our performance against our 2018 OIP Commitment to Stakeholders targets, which includes activities that are not measured by financial metrics. In addition to the payouts under the 2018 OIP, in recognition of our named executive officers' performance and contributions to our very strong results in fiscal year 2018, the LDCC awarded the named executive officers long-term performance recognition awards of Deferred Retention Stock Units as described in greater detail below.
Key Compensation Corporate Governance Practices
The LDCC and our NCGC continuously review evolving practices in executive compensation and corporate governance. We have adopted certain policies and practices that we believe are consistent with industry best practices.
Principles of Our Compensation Framework
The LDCC believes that the compensation program for executive officers should reward the achievement of our short-term and long-term objectives and that compensation should be related to the value created for our shareowners. Furthermore, the compensation program should reflect competitive and best practices in the marketplace. The following objectives serve as the LDCC's guiding principles for all compensation decisions.
In addition, the LDCC believes that the various elements of our compensation program effectively align compensation with performance measures that are directly related to our financial goals and creation of shareowner value without encouraging executives to take unnecessary and excessive risks.
Elements of Our Compensation Program for Named Executive Officers
The LDCC has a specific mix of compensation components that it targets, with the intent to make each component of total direct compensation competitive with that of other companies of similar size and operational characteristics while also linking compensation to individual and corporate performance and encouraging share ownership by senior management. The table below describes each compensatory element available in our compensation program for executives and briefly explains how it promotes our objectives. We believe the combination of these elements provides an appropriate balance of rewards, incentives and benefits to our executives and enables us to meet our desired compensation objectives, strengthen our ability to attract and retain highly qualified individuals and to appropriately link pay to performance.
The Compensation Review Process
Process for Approval of Compensation Measures
Our planning process begins in May (the third quarter of our fiscal year) when management identifies financial and operational goals, performance measures and action plans that are tied to our Commitment to Stakeholders and that will be executed by the business units and approved by our management in August (the fourth quarter of our fiscal year) for the following fiscal year. These metrics are typically presented to the Board in September for approval. Upon approval by the Board, the financial and operational goals become the compensation measures for the executive officers and are the foundation for our Commitment to Stakeholders, which is also communicated to the entire organization through the performance planning and evaluation process and through management presentations to employees.
Role of the LDCC and the Chief Executive Officer
Governance of our compensation program is the responsibility of the LDCC, which consists solely of independent directors. The LDCC works with management, in particular our Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, in making decisions regarding our compensation program. The LDCC reviews and takes into account all elements of executive compensation in setting policies and determining compensation amounts. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for recommending to the LDCC the compensation amounts of each of our named executive officers, other than himself. The Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief Operating Officer attend meetings of the LDCC, but do not participate in the portion of the meetings when their respective compensation or performance is discussed.
Role of Compensation Consultant
The LDCC is authorized to retain experts, consultants and other advisors to aid in the discharge of its duties. For fiscal year 2018, the LDCC retained FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant. All work completed by the independent compensation consultant is subject to the approval of the LDCC. The independent compensation consultant's role, with respect to the LDCC, is to provide independent advice and counsel. The LDCC does not delegate authority to its outside advisor. Prior to each meeting of the LDCC, the independent compensation consultant meets with the Chief Executive Officer or his executive officer designee and the Chair of the LDCC, followed, as deemed necessary by the LDCC Chair, by a private meeting with only the LDCC Chair. The LDCC also periodically meets in executive session with its independent compensation consultant to discuss our compensation program. During fiscal year 2018, the independent compensation consultant periodically met with management at the direction of the LDCC, participated in LDCC meetings, reviewed materials in advance, provided additional data to the LDCC on market trends and overall compensation design and reviewed recommendations for base salary, annual short-term and long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers.
In May 2018, the LDCC determined that FW Cook had no other financial ties to the Company or our management and that it does not have any conflicts of interest after considering the relevant factors, including those prescribed under SEC and NYSE rules.
Peer Group Analysis
So that we can successfully attract and retain the high-quality executive talent critical to our long-term success, we intend that the levels of compensation available to executive officers who enhance corporate value are competitive with the compensation offered by publicly held companies that are similar to us with regard to size and industry focus. To understand the competitive market for pay and set the compensation terms for our program, we analyze the compensation programs of a peer group of companies.
Fiscal Year 2018 Peer Group
The companies in the peer group were selected based on business model similarities, size and other growth and business factors. Our peer group for fiscal year 2018 compensation ("2018 Peer Group"), which remains unchanged from 2017, is as follows:
As of July 31, 2018, our market capitalization was at the 55th percentile of the 2018 Peer Group, and our revenues were at the 83rd percentile of the 2018 Peer Group.
Establishing Total Direct Remuneration
Total direct remuneration is the sum of base salary, annual short-term incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards. A major portion of each named executive officer's remuneration is established by performance-based incentives, which requires achievement of performance goals as a condition to earning annual short-term incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards. The at-risk portion of total direct remuneration provides increased pay for higher levels of corporate and/or business unit performance and lower pay for performance below target levels.
In setting each named executive officer's total direct remuneration opportunity, the LDCC takes into account other factors such as the responsibilities, experience, performance, contributions and service of the executive. As a result, we do not set total direct remuneration or the component parts at levels to achieve a mathematically precise market position. In determining executive compensation, the LDCC reviews all components of our Chief Executive Officer's and each other named executive officer's total direct compensation to ensure such compensation meets the goals of the program. As a part of this review, the LDCC considers corporate performance information, compensation survey data, the advice of its independent consultant and the recommendations of management. The LDCC also takes into consideration individual and overall company operating performance to ensure executive compensation reflects past performance, as well as future potential and adequately differentiates between employees, based on the scope and complexity of the employee's job position, market comparisons, individual performance and experience and our ability to pay. The LDCC reviews annually our Chief Executive Officer's and each other named executive officer's performance prior to considering changes in compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer's performance, and the performance of each other named executive officer, is evaluated in light of our overall performance (as described in greater detail below) and non-financial goals and strategic objectives approved by the LDCC and the Board. Based on its latest review, the LDCC believes total compensation for each of the named executive officers is reasonable.
The following table shows the target total direct remuneration opportunity that the LDCC approved for fiscal year 2018. The table states the annual salary of each named executive officer as of January 1, 2018, other than Mr. Migliaccio, who received a base salary increase on July 9, 2018. The table includes the amount of the annual short-term incentive award that could have been earned by a named executive officer meeting target performance goals relating to NFE, our Commitment to Stakeholders and individual leadership described below. Annually, the LDCC uses long-term equity incentive awards as a component of the named executive officers' compensation. The table below shows the target value of long-term equity incentive awards granted to each of the named executive officers in fiscal year 2018.
FISCAL YEAR 2018 TOTAL TARGET DIRECT REMUNERATION OPPORTUNITY
Components of Compensation
Base Salary
Base salary increases for all of our named executive officers, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, are recommended by our Chief Executive Officer and subject to review and approval by the LDCC and the Board. Base salary increases for our Chief Executive Officer are recommended by the LDCC and approved by the independent members of the Board. In setting the base salary level of each executive officer, the LDCC considers marketplace compensation data compiled and presented by its independent compensation consultant, as well as the executive's experience level, demonstrated capabilities, time and placement in position, our geographic region and the actual performance of the Company and the executive. No particular weight is assigned to any one factor. In November 2017, the Board approved an increase in base salary for the following named executive officers of between 3.0 and 13.3 percent, effective January 1, 2018.
Annual Short-Term Incentive Awards
We maintain a strong link between performance and pay within our executive compensation program through emphasis on incentives and utilization of financial, operational and leadership measures, which we believe are key drivers of long-term value creation for shareowners. The LDCC reviews and approves the annual performance objectives for the Company and our named executive officers at the start of each fiscal year. In November 2017, the LDCC approved the 2018 OIP. Our objectives for the 2018 OIP considered the results of a review of our compensation programs by FW Cook and their accompanying recommendations.
The 2018 OIP sought to motivate our senior executives by rewarding them when our annual financial performance goals and their individual performance goals were met or exceeded. After the end of fiscal year 2018, the Chief Executive Officer and the LDCC evaluated the degree to which the Company and our named executive officers met or exceeded their respective goals. Under the 2018 OIP, the Chief Executive Officer recommends the annual short-term incentive awards to the LDCC for executive officers other than himself.
2018 OIP Annual Short-Term Incentive Awards
Under the 2018 OIP, the "outer plan" performance hurdle approved by the LDCC for the named executive officers' annual short-term incentive awards in November 2017 was NJR NFE per basic share of $1.36 ("2018 OIP Performance Hurdle"). An explanation of NFE is provided directly below under "Net Financial Earnings Component." If the 2018 OIP Performance Hurdle is achieved, the maximum payout to the named executive officers under the 2018 OIP is 150 percent of their respective target annual short-term incentive opportunities.
In addition, under the 2018 OIP, based upon the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer, the LDCC reserves the ability to modify, based upon its qualitative assessment, any annual short-term incentive award payable. Our Chief Executive Officer, subject to LDCC approval, also may recommend special recognition awards to named executive officers who have made significant contributions and have demonstrated a sustained level of outstanding performance. The LDCC may approve special recognition awards to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer engages in extensive discussions, evaluation and review of his recommendations with the LDCC to reach a consensus on the annual short-term incentive awards.
The Chief Executive Officer uses the criteria set forth in the 2018 OIP to guide his recommendations of the annual short-term incentive awards for the named executive officers, other than himself, to the LDCC. The criteria that guides the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations are: (I) NFE, (II) Commitment to Stakeholders and (III) Leadership. Each named executive officer's annual short-term incentive award is based 50 percent on our NFE, 30 percent on the named executive officer achieving an individual leadership component and 20 percent on the Company meeting the goals of an overall Commitment to Stakeholders component. These criteria are used to balance our focus on affordability with the use of non-financial metrics that are leading indicators of the creation of long-term shareowner value. While these criteria serve as guidelines, the Chief Executive Officer has discretion to modify the actual awards for recommendation to the LDCC. The target percentage of base salary for the annual short-term award opportunity for each of our named executive officers is set forth below.
Actual fiscal year 2018 short-term incentive award payments under the 2018 OIP, if earned, could range from 0 percent up to 150 percent of this targeted amount for each of the named executive officers. Amounts payable under the 2018 OIP could be paid in full, or in part, in the form of cash, restricted stock or deferred retention stock based on our Chief Executive Officer's recommendation and subsequent approval by the LDCC. The actual payouts of the 2018 annual short-term incentive awards are described in the section of the Proxy Statement entitled "— Actual Fiscal Year 2018 Short-Term Incentive Award Payouts Under the 2018 OIP," on page 48.
Net Financial Earnings Component
NFE represents net income excluding the accounting impact and resulting volatility in our GAAP earnings due to unrealized gains and losses from certain derivative instruments, net of applicable tax adjustments. NFE is not an alternative to a measure derived from GAAP, such as earnings per share or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance. We use NFE as a key performance measure for compensatory purposes because we believe it strongly encourages capital discipline and better investment decisions and leads to enhanced cash flow and shareowner value. Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker, and he uses NFE as a measure of profit or loss in measuring the results of our operations.
No annual short-term incentive award is payable to our named executive officers under the 2018 OIP unless we achieve the 2018 OIP Performance Hurdle and a minimum of at least 75 percent ("Minimum NFE") of our target NFE amount for fiscal year 2018. However, the LDCC retains the ability to pay an annual short-term incentive award if we do not achieve the Minimum NFE as there may be circumstances under which the LDCC may decide that an annual short-term incentive award is still appropriate. While an annual short-term incentive award may be paid if we achieve the Minimum NFE, if we do not achieve at least 80 percent of NJR's target NFE amount ("Threshold NFE"), no portion of the annual short-term incentive award would be paid attributable to the NFE component for that executive officer. Achievement of 120 percent of NJR's target NFE amount ("Maximum NFE") or greater would result in a payout of 150% of the target amount for the NFE component.
The 2018 OIP allows the LDCC to approve the exclusion of certain expenses in excess of budgeted amounts from the calculation of NFE used for purposes of the NFE component of the annual short-term incentive award formula ("Adjusted NFE"). These adjustments are designed to allow us to make certain investments and expenditures in years with strong financial performance at NJR without penalizing our executives. In addition, the LDCC approved the exclusion of the one-time positive benefit on NFE of the Tax Act, resulting from the revaluation of NJR's deferred tax assets and liabilities.
For fiscal year 2018, the target NFE amount for NJR was $159.4 million. Therefore, the Minimum NFE was $119.55 million. The fiscal year 2018 NFE target is based on approximately seven percent average annual growth from fiscal year 2017 NFE through fiscal year 2018. NJR's actual NFE for fiscal year 2018 was $240.5 million. NJR's Adjusted NFE, net of the effect of the revaluation of NJR's deferred tax assets and liabilities and adjustments excluding expenses in excess of budgeted amounts approved by the LDCC, was $195.4 million. The adjustments excluded expenses related to our voluntary early retirement program, charitable contributions and significant management consulting expenses outside of NJR's budget.
The table below shows the Minimum NFE and the performance/ payout curve for the NFE component of the annual short-term incentive awards. The maximum level of payout for the NFE component was 150 percent of the target amount while achievement of Threshold NFE would result in a payout of 50  percent of the target amount. Payouts for performance between the stated performance levels are interpolated.
PAYOUT FOR NFE PERFORMANCE
Leadership Component
The LDCC assesses the leadership component for our Chief Executive Officer based on a review of his performance in comparison with his specific individual objectives for the past fiscal year. The leadership component of the annual short-term incentive award for the other named executive officers is determined based on our Chief Executive Officer's review of established business unit initiatives and individual performance assessments, which is then discussed and ratified by the LDCC. As part of his review, our Chief Executive Officer seeks and considers specific examples of how each named executive officer met these objectives. The maximum payout for this portion of the annual short-term incentive award is equal to 150 percent of the targeted amount. The LDCC determines the leadership component of the annual short-term incentive award for each of our named executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer, taking into consideration reviews by our Chief Executive Officer.
Our Chief Executive Officer's leadership objectives for fiscal year 2018 included:
The leadership objectives of the other named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 included:
Commitment to Stakeholders (CTS) Component
The CTS component of the annual short-term incentive award is determined based on a subset of 57 specific performance measures that the LDCC views as important to our shareowners, and that encompass a broader range of our activities that are not necessarily reflected in our financial metrics. These performance measures are company-wide and fall into the following five categories:
The 57 performance measures were established through a process that began early in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. A team of employees from across our business units selected these performance measures spanning the five CTS categories listed above. The set of 57 performance measures was reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who made further revisions and recommendations to the measures, which were then approved by our Chief Executive Officer and our Board.
The LDCC and management use these metrics to measure our overall effort to provide our customers, shareowners, communities and other stakeholders with the highest quality service and performance. Each of the performance measures is objective and quantifiable. For instance, one way we measure corporate citizenship is by calculating the total number of employee volunteer hours and calculating the total number of people reached by our customer and community outreach programs using data compiled at each such event during the course of the fiscal year.
For each performance measure, a performance target was developed based upon historical company information, peer information, comparative data, trends and, in certain cases, benchmarks required by state regulations. Performance targets were set by the appropriate business unit leaders, reviewed by our Quality Department and approved by our senior executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer. Thereafter, the
Board approved the 57 performance measures and targets. The performance measures and targets were published and distributed to our employees shortly after the beginning of fiscal year 2018. Separately, the senior executive team selected a subset of the 57 performance measures for recommendation to the Chief Executive Officer and the LDCC for purposes of determining the CTS component of the annual short-term incentive award. The Chief Executive Officer and the LDCC then reviewed the subset. The LDCC and the Board ultimately approved a final subset of six performance measures (the "Performance Measures"). When selecting the Performance Measures, the Chief Executive Officer and the LDCC selected one or more significant measures in each of the five CTS categories to encompass a broad spectrum of our performance, thereby allowing them to best gauge, on a company-wide basis, how well the executive management team is fulfilling the CTS. As a result, the LDCC considers the Performance Measures as those most useful for a broad assessment of executive performance.
When determining the CTS component of the annual short-term incentive award, the LDCC, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, establishes threshold, target and maximum performance levels for each of the Performance Measures. The threshold level is based on a level of performance that was believed to be achievable, the target level is based on a level of performance that was believed to be aggressive, but obtainable, and the maximum level is based on a level of performance that was believed to be attainable by achieving exceptional performance. Each of these Performance Measures is weighted equally and an overall average measurement is obtained. The overall average measurement reflects the average company-wide performance on the Performance Measures (each weighted equally) on a scale of 0 to 120 percent of the target goal. The percentage of target is adjusted to a scale of 0 to 150 percent for purposes of determining the CTS component of the annual short-term incentive award. For example, if we were to meet the maximum of 120 percent of the target goal for each of the Performance Measures, the average company-wide performance amount would be 150 percent.
The table below shows the six equally-weighted Performance Measures, and indicates our threshold, target and maximum performance levels, as well as indicating our actual performance for each of the Performance Measures:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     CTS  PERFORMANCE MEASURES       
     CTS  PERFORMANCE MEASURES       
[END TABLE]
As illustrated in the tables above and below this paragraph, during fiscal year 2018, the average company-wide performance as compared to the target goal was 111 percent of the target goal. This corresponded to a payout of 127.5 percent of the target payout amount for the CTS component of the annual short-term incentive award formula.
Actual Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Short-Term Incentive Award Payouts under the 2018 OIP
In November 2018, the LDCC reviewed our NFE per basic share against the 2018 OIP Performance Hurdle before considering whether each of the named executive officers qualified for an annual short-term incentive award under the 2018 OIP as set forth below:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Since the 2018 OIP Performance Hurdle was met, the LDCC determined that the named executive officers were eligible for an annual short-term incentive award under the 2018 OIP of up to 150 percent of their respective target awards. The LDCC reviewed the results of the 2018 OIP for Mr. Downes and then reviewed the results of the 2018 OIP for the other named executive officers based on the recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer. The amount of the annual short-term incentive award approved by the LDCC for the Chief Executive Officer and the amounts of the annual short-term incentive awards recommended by the Chief Executive Officer to the LDCC, and subsequently approved by the LDCC, for the other named executive officers, are set forth on page 50.
For fiscal year 2018, the NFE, CTS and leadership components comprised 50 percent, 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of the annual short-term incentive awards under the 2018 OIP for each of our named executive officers. This totaled a payout amount equal to 145.5 percent of the target amounts for the fiscal year 2018 total annual short-term incentive award for Messrs. Downes and Westhoven and Mses. Mullan and Washington and 140.5 percent of the target amount for Mr. Migliaccio, each as calculated as set forth below.
NFE Component
For fiscal year 2018, our Adjusted NJR NFE were $195.4 million, which corresponded to a payout amount equal to 75 percent of the total target annual short-term incentive award related to the NFE component for the named executive officers. We calculated this payout amount as follows:
NFE Component Calculation
CTS Component
In addition, we achieved 111 percent of our CTS targets, which corresponded to a payout amount equal to 25.5 percent of the total target annual short-term incentive award. We calculated this payout amount as follows:
Leadership Component
Our Chief Executive Officer submitted individual leadership performance reviews for each of the named executive officers for discussion and consideration by the LDCC. The LDCC reviewed each of the named executive officer's 2018 individual leadershipresults, including our Chief Executive Officer, and assessed these results against such named executive officer's objectives. Below is a summary of certain of the 2018 individual performance highlights for each of our named executive officers that were factored into their 2018 annual short-term incentive award and the setting of 2018 total targeted direct remuneration.
The Chief Executive Officer recommended to the LDCC that Mr. Westhoven, Ms. Mullan and Ms. Washington achieved 150 percent of their leadership goals and that Mr. Migliaccio achieved 133.3  percent of his leadership goals, which corresponded to a payout amount equal to 45 percent and 40  percent of these total target annual short-term incentive awards, respectively. The LDCC determined that the Chief Executive Officer achieved 150 percent of his leadership goals, which corresponded to a payout amount equal to 45 percent of his total target annual short-term incentive award. We calculated the payout amount for the Leadership Component as follows:
The 2018 OIP formula payout amount was equal to 145.5 percent of each of the target total annual short-term incentive awards for Messrs. Downes and Westhoven and Mses. Mullan and Washington. The 2018 OIP formula payout amount for Mr. Migliaccio was equal to 140.5 percent of the target annual short-term incentive award.
These annual short-term incentive award amounts are set forth in the table below and in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 62 of this Proxy Statement.
Deferred Retention Stock Unit ("DRSU") Awards to NEOs
In recognition of NJR's outstanding performance during fiscal year 2018 as described in more detail on page 37 under "Fiscal Year 2018 Performance Highlights," the LDCC awarded performance recognition awards, in the form of long-term DRSU awards, to each of our NEOs. These long-term DRSU awards also are designed to promote retention and protect our investment in human capital by providing disincentive to executives to leave us for a competitor and to align the interests of our NEOs with the long-term interests of our shareowners by linking compensation to changes in company stock price and dividend payments.
The DRSUs are denominated in dollars and converted into deferred stock units based on our Common Stock price at the date of grant. At the end of the deferral period on October 15, 2021, the deferred stock units will be paid out in shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis plus accrued dividends, provided the named executive officer complies with restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions.
As set forth in the table below, on November 13, 2018, the LDCC granted the following DRSU awards:
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
Our primary objectives in granting long-term equity incentive awards are to encourage significant ownership of our Common Stock by management and to provide long-term financial incentives linked directly to the long-term performance of the Company. The LDCC believes that significant ownership of our Common Stock by senior management is the optimal method for aligning the interests of management and our shareowners. Our stock incentive program is effectively designed to further this objective.
In November 2017, after consulting with FW Cook, the LDCC determined that a portion of our executive officers' total compensation should continue to be delivered in a mix of Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units and performance-based awards. For fiscal year 2018, the Board approved, pursuant to the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, the long-term incentive program granting four types of awards:
The long-term incentive equity awards granted to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer were entirely "at-risk," consisting of performance share units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units, which could become worthless if the applicable performance goals are not met. Approximately 68 percent of the shares comprising the awards to our other named executive officers were "at-risk," while the remaining 32  percent of the awards were in the form of Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units. Stock awards were granted to promote retention of the named executive officers, while the FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Units benchmark our performance against an industry comparator group over an extended period of time and the FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Units measure our performance against cumulative NFE per share-based goals set by the LDCC.
The LDCC determined the award of performance share units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and the Board ratified that determination.
The graphic on the left below shows that 100 percent of our Chief Executive Officer's long-term incentive plan grants in fiscal year 2018 were performance-based equity grants. The graphic in the middle illustrates the split in number of shares granted between Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units grants and the performance-based equity grants to our named executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer, in fiscal year 2018. The graphic on the right shows the historical mix between the Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Retention Stock grants and performance-based awards to named executive officers between 2014 and 2018 based upon number of shares granted. These graphics highlight our emphasis over the past five years on awarding a mix of performance-based awards, such as performance share units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units, and Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Retention Stock awards. The actual value a named executive officer may receive will depend upon the number of shares received and the market price of our Common Stock at the time the awards vest.
In designing the long-term equity incentive program, the LDCC established the following key objectives:
With the exception of significant promotions and new hires, equity grants, including long-term equity incentive awards, are generally awarded at the first regularly scheduled LDCC meeting following the conclusion of the fiscal year. The LDCC selects this timing because it enables us to consider the prior year performance of the Company and the participants and our expectations for the next performance period, while also ensuring that regular awards will be made after we publicly disclose our performance for the year. The awards are made as early as practicable in our fiscal year to maximize the time period for the incentives associated with the awards.
Fiscal Year 2018 ("FY 2018") TSR Performance Share Unit Awards
In November 2017, the LDCC approved the grant of the FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Units with performance criteria based upon the Company's TSR, pursuant to the 2017 Plan. As set forth in the table below, the FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Unit awards were granted to the named executive officers as of November 14, 2017. Each FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Unit is equal to one share of Common Stock. The FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Unit awards vest at the end of a 36-month performance period beginning on October 1, 2017, and ending on September 30, 2020, based on Company TSR versus a 19-company industry comparator group used solely for purposes of this award, which is listed below.
The industry comparator group set forth above includes natural gas and multi-utility companies with a market capitalization between one-fifth to five times that of NJR and includes all of the 12 companies used for compensation benchmarking. Upon review by the LDCC in September 2018, pursuant to the terms of the award agreement, WGL Holdings, Inc. was removed from the comparator group as it was acquired by another company in July 2018 and no longer exists as a publicly-traded corporation. FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Units will not vest if performance during that period does not meet the minimum threshold level. If the performance meets or exceeds the maximum expectations, 150 percent of the target number of awarded FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Units will be earned.
The number of FY 2018 TSR Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on the following table:
TSR shall be computed as follows:
TSR = (Priceend – Pricebegin + Dividends) / Pricebegin
Pricebegin = the average of the closing share price of the common stock over the 20 trading days beginning October 1, 2017.
Priceend = the average of the closing share price of the common  stock over the 20 trading days ending September 30, 2020.
Dividends = dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders with respect to the common stock with ex-dividend dates falling within the 36-month period between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2020 (with such dividends and other distributions deemed reinvested in shares of common stock as of the ex-dividend date based on the price of the common stock on the ex-dividend date where not paid in shares of common stock).
Price = the closing price of the common stock as of the applicable date.
Upon achievement of TSR at a percentile between any two specified percentiles, the TSR Performance Share Units earned will be mathematically interpolated on a straight-line basis.
FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Unit Awards
In November 2017, the LDCC approved the grant of FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Unit awards with performance criteria based upon the Company's cumulative NFE per basic share, pursuant to the 2017 Plan. Each FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Unit is equal to one share of Common Stock. The FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Units vest, if at all, based upon our Cumulative NFEPS (defined below) over the 36-month period beginning on October 1, 2017, and ending on September 30, 2020. The NFEPS targets are based upon our three-year financial plan and are designed to challenge our executives by being aggressive, but achievable, and to encourage and reward continued growth in our NFE on a per share basis. The cumulative NFE Performance Share target of $5.76 represents a six percent annual growth rate using fiscal year 2017 NFE as a baseline. The number of FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on the following table.
"NFEPS" is the NFE per basic share of Common Stock that the Company reports on a quarterly and annual basis to the public and in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as adjusted by the LDCC to remove the one-time benefit to NFE from the revaluation of NJR's deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the Tax Act.
"Cumulative NFEPS" is the sum of the annual NFEPS for the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020 calculated as follows:
CumulativeNFEPS = NFEPSFY2018 + NFEPSFY2019 + NFEPSFY2020
FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Units will not vest if performance does not meet the minimum threshold level. If the performance meets or exceeds the maximum expectations, 150 percent of the target number of awarded FY 2018 NFE Performance Shares will be earned. Payout for performance between the measures for the minimum and maximum payout will be interpolated. The earned FY 2018 NFE Performance Share Units will be delivered to participants at the end of the performance period, upon the determination of the LDCC that the performance objectives have been met.
FY 2018 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards
In November 2017, Messrs. Downes and Westhoven were granted Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PBRS") with performance criteria based upon NJR's NFE per basic share in the year ended September 30, 2018. The PBRS awards may vest in up to three equal installments on September 30, 2018, September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2020 if the performance goal of $1.36 NFE per basic share for the year ended September 30, 2018 is achieved.
The performance goal of $1.36 NFE per basic share for NJR for the year ended September 30, 2018, was met and certified by the LDCC on November 13, 2018, resulting in an earnout of 7,912 shares, including accumulated dividends, for Mr. Downes and 2,261 shares, including accumulated dividends, for Mr. Westhoven.
FY 2018 Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units
On November 14, 2017, the LDCC approved the grant of Time-Vested Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") awards to three of our named executive officers as recognition for performance during fiscal year 2017 and as a retention vehicle pursuant to the 2017 Plan. These RSU awards will vest in up to three equal installments on September 30, 2018, September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2020. The LDCC values Time-Vested Restricted Stock Unit awards at the fair market value of the number of shares of our Common Stock on the date of grant.
Fiscal Year 2016 ("FY 2016") NFE Performance Shares Vesting
In November 2015, the LDCC approved the grant of FY 2016 NFE Performance Share Unit awards with performance criteria based upon the Company's cumulative NFE per basic share to certain of our named executive officers, pursuant to the 2007 Plan. Each FY 2016 NFE Performance Share Unit was equal to one share of Common Stock. The FY 2016 NFE Performance Shares were eligible for vesting at the end of a 36-month performance period beginning on October 1, 2015, and ending on September 30, 2018, based upon our Cumulative NFEPS (defined below) over the 36-month period. As illustrated in the tables below, 121 percent of FY 2016 NFE Performance Shares vested as our actual performance was certified by the LDCC as $5.40 per share.
"NFEPS" is the NFE per basic share of Common Stock that the Company reports on a quarterly and annual basis to the public and in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as adjusted by the LDCC to remove the one-time benefit to NFE from the revaluation of NJR's deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the Tax Act.
"Cumulative NFEPS" is the sum of the annual NFEPS for the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018 calculated as follows:
CumulativeNFEPS = NFEPSFY2016 + NFEPSFY2017 + NFEPSFY2018
FY 2016 TSR Performance Shares Vesting
In November 2015, the LDCC approved the grant of FY 2016 TSR Performance Share Unit awards with performance criteria based upon the Company's cumulative NFE per basic share to certain of our named executive officers, pursuant to the 2007 Plan. Each FY 2016 NFE Performance Share Unit was equal to one share of Common Stock. The FY 2016 NFE Performance Shares were eligible for vesting at the end of a 36-month performance period beginning on October 1, 2015, and ending on September 30, 2018, based upon our relative TSR versus the established comparator group used for compensation purposes at the time of grant. As illustrated in the tables below, 99 percent of the FY 2016 TSR Performance Shares vested. At the end of the performance period, our actual performance, as certified by the LDCC, was in the 57th percentile.
TSR was computed as follows:
TSR = (Priceend – Pricebegin + Dividends) / Pricebegin
Pricebegin = closing share price of common stock at September 30, 2015
Priceend = closing share price of common stock at end on September 30, 2018
Dividends = dividends paid to shareholders of common stock during 36-month period
Retirement Programs
Our retirement programs for senior executives provide an opportunity for each participating executive, through long-term service to us, to receive certain retirement benefits. Three of our named executive officers participate in the New Jersey Natural Gas Company Plan for Retirement Allowances for Non-Represented Employees (the "Non-Represented Plan"), which is a trusteed noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan. Each of our named executive officers also participates in our 401(k) Plan, which is a trusteed defined contribution plan. All of our non-represented employees hired on or after October 1, 2009, are covered by an enhanced defined contribution plan feature of our 401(k) Plan instead of the Non-Represented Plan. These plans provide retirement benefits to broad groups of employees and executives. Four of our named executive officers also participate in the Savings Equalization Plan of NJR, which we refer to as the SEP, and three of our named executive officers participate in the Pension Equalization Plan of NJR, which we refer to as the PEP, both of which are unfunded non-qualified plans. These plans provide benefits that would have been made under the Non-Represented Plan and the 401(k) Plan, but for the limitations on compensation and contributions imposed by Sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17), 401(k), 401(m) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the named executive officers and certain other officers have supplemental retirement agreements. Under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreements, which we also refer to as SERP Agreements, benefits are payable over a
60-month period commencing at age 65. At projected retirement, the total maximum amount payable to our Chief Executive Officer under his SERP Agreement is currently $250,000. Messrs. Migliaccio and Westhoven and Mses. Mullan and Washington would each be entitled to maximum amounts of $125,000 under their respective SERP Agreements as of September 30, 2018. These are described more fully in the narrative following the Pension Benefits table on page 70 of this Proxy Statement.
We also sponsor health care plans that provide post-employment medical and life insurance benefits to union and non-union employees who meet the eligibility requirements. Retirees must meet certain age and service requirements to be eligible. Depending on the year of retirement, benefits may be subject to annual deductibles, coinsurance requirements and retiree contributions. As of September 30, 2018, with the exception of Mr. Downes, none of the named executive officers have completed the age and service requirements to be eligible for post-employment health coverage.
Severance Policies
Severance protection is provided to our senior executives in their employment continuation agreements with the Company (defined below) and only in the event that a senior executive is terminated following a "change of control." This protection is designed to be fair and competitive and to aid in attracting and retaining experienced executives. We believe that the protection we provide, including the level of severance payments and post-termination benefits, is appropriate and within the range of competitive practice.
Severance protection following a change of control provides a number of important benefits to us. First, it permits an executive to evaluate a potential change of control while relatively free of concern for the executive's own situation or the need to seek employment elsewhere. Second, change of control transactions take time to unfold, and a stable management team can help preserve our operations either to enhance the value delivered to a buyer in the transaction or, if no transaction is consummated, to ensure that our business will continue without undue disruption. Finally, we believe that the change of control protections in place encourage management to consider, on an ongoing basis, whether a strategic transaction might be advantageous to our shareowners, even one that would vest control of the Company in a third party. The LDCC believes that the potential cost of executive change of control severance payments and benefits, as a percentage of the potential buyout price, would be well within the range of reasonable industry practice and represents an appropriate cost relative to the benefits to our shareowners and us.
Amended and Restated Employment Continuation Agreements
Each of our named executive officers has entered into an Employment Continuation Agreement ("Employment Continuation Agreement"). The Employment Continuation Agreements provide each executive certain rights in the event that his or her employment is terminated within two years following the occurrence of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the agreements) (I) by us without "Cause" (as defined in the agreements) or (II) by the executive for "Good Reason" (as defined in the agreements). Subject to the limitation described in the next paragraph, upon such termination of employment, the executive, in the case of Mr. Downes, will receive three times the sum or, in the case of the other named executive officers, two times the sum, of (x) annual base salary and (y) the average of annual bonuses paid or payable with respect to the last three calendar years ended prior to the Change of Control. The Employment Continuation Agreements contain a "best net" provision where if any excise tax is due, NJR will not make a gross-up payment, but instead will reduce payments to the executive to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of an excise tax if such reduction will provide the executive the best net after-tax result. If full payment to an executive will result in the best net after-tax result, the full amount will be paid, but the executive will be solely responsible for any potential excise tax payment.
For purposes of the Employment Continuation Agreements, a "change of control" generally means:
As a condition of the right of the executive to receive payments under the Employment Continuation Agreements, the executive must enter into a binding agreement that, without the written consent of the Board, the executive will not for a period of two years, acting alone or in conjunction with others, directly or indirectly:
The payments that may be due under the Employment Continuation Agreements in the event of a change of control are described in more detail below in the section entitled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" beginning on page 72 of this Proxy Statement.
Deferred Compensation
To enhance the competitiveness of our executive compensation program and increase our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel necessary for our continued success and progress, we offer an Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan to provide a select group of management and highly compensated employees of the Company and its affiliates a means to defer receipt of specified portions of compensation and to have such deferred amounts treated as if invested in specified investment vehicles. Participants in the Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan may defer the receipt of compensation or awards, which may be in the form of cash, stock or stock-denominated awards, including salary, annual bonus awards, long-term awards and compensation payable under other plans and programs, employment agreements or other arrangements. Deferrals under the Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan must comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, U.S. federal income tax laws and Treasury Regulations. Although all of the named executive officers are eligible to participate in the Officers' Deferred Compensation Plan, none of our named executive officers have any amounts in such plan.
Other Benefits
The LDCC believes employee benefits are an essential component of our competitive total compensation package. These benefits are designed to attract and retain our employees. The named executive officers may participate in the same benefit plans as our salaried employees, which include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, travel and accident insurance and our 401(k) Plan. As part of the 401(k) Plan, we generally match 65 percent of the first six percent of compensation contributed by the employee into the 401(k) Plan subject to the Internal Revenue Code and our 401(k) Plan limits. The matching contribution is limited to 50 percent for certain represented employees of NJRHS who transferred from NJNG and are currently accruing pension benefits. We have disclosed all company matches for our named executive officers in the column labeled "All Other Compensation," in the Summary Compensation Table on page 62, and separately disclosed each amount in Footnote 5 to that table on page 63 of this Proxy Statement.
The LDCC provides our executives, including named executive officers, with additional benefits that we believe provide security for current and future needs of the executives and their families and therefore assist in attracting and retaining them. These other benefits are structured to be within the competitive range relative to our peer group. The additional benefits we provide, or have provided to some of our executives, consist of the following and are included in the amounts set forth in the column labeled "All Other Compensation," in the Summary Compensation Table on page 62, and separately disclosed in Footnote 5 to that table on page 63 of this Proxy Statement: car allowance, preventative health maintenance program and executive insurance program. In addition to the cash and equity compensation discussed above, we provide our Chief Executive Officer and the other named executive officers with the same benefits package available to all of our salaried employees. The package includes:
For business purposes, it may be appropriate for certain members of senior management to belong to a golf or social club so that such executives have an appropriate entertainment forum for customers and appropriate interaction with their communities.
Share Ownership Guidelines
The LDCC believes it is important to align the interests of senior management with our shareowners. While the LDCC considers this principle when determining the appropriate mix of base salary, annual short-term incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards, the LDCC also established share ownership guidelines that encourage the accumulation and retention of our Common Stock.
These guidelines are subject to annual review by the LDCC and were amended during fiscal year 2017 to clarify some of the provisions.
Under the share ownership guidelines, officers of the Company are required to own shares of our Common Stock with a total share value as set forth in the following table (required Common Stock ownership amount is determined as a multiple of the officer's base salary):
Until an officer achieves the minimum share ownership under the guidelines described above, he or she must retain 50 percent of all shares awarded to him or her under the Company's stock award and incentive plans, net of the number of shares the officer has applied to the payment of taxes on such awards. Compliance with these guidelines will be determined annually on October 1st using the average quarter-end closing price of the Company's Common Stock for the most recently completed fiscal year. Once the minimum stock ownership threshold is achieved, he or she will remain in compliance with the guidelines despite future changes in stock price and base salary, as long as his or her holdings do not decline below the number of shares at the time the minimum stock ownership requirement was met.
Each of the named executive officers was in compliance with these share ownership guidelines as of September 30, 2018, and all of our officers either meet the minimum share ownership requirements under the guidelines or have met the retention requirements applicable to those who do not yet meet the minimum share ownership requirements.
Compensation Recoupment ("Clawback") Policy
Under the Clawback Policy, in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the applicable securities laws, the LDCC may recoup from any current or former executive officer (or certain other employees) who received cash or equity performance-based compensation within the three-year period prior to the restatement, the amount of performance-based compensation paid in excess of what the executive officer (or other employee) would have been paid based on the restatement.
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy
To ensure alignment of the interests of our shareowners, directors and executive officers, including our named executive officers, the Company's Code of Conduct does not permit directors, officers or employees to engage in short-term or speculative transactions involving the Company's securities, including short sales, publicly-traded options, hedging or pledging the Company's securities as collateral.
United States Federal Income Tax Limits on Deductibility
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally sets a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct for federal income tax purposes in any given year with respect to the compensation of each of our named executive officers. For years beginning prior to January 1, 2018, under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code the $1 million limitation did not apply to qualified performance-based compensation that satisfied certain requirements, including, among others, approval of the material terms of the plan by the Company's shareowners. Effective for the years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, there is no exception under the Tax Act for qualified performance-based compensation from the Section 162(m) limitation; although a transition rule applies in some circumstances for outstanding awards. We consider the impact of the deduction limit under Section 162(m) when developing and implementing our executive compensation programs. We intend to design our executive compensation arrangements to be consistent with our best interests and the interests of our shareowners. We believe that it is important to preserve flexibility in administering compensation programs to promote various corporate goals. Accordingly, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must qualify as deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts paid under our compensation programs may not be deductible as the result of Section 162(m). To the extent we determine it to be consistent with our best interests and the interests of our shareowners, we intend to preserve, to the extent practicable, the applicability of the transition rule to existing awards. However, there is no guaranty that such transition status can or will be applicable.
Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the subsequent rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, we are including a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers. The vote on this proposal will be non-binding on the Board and us and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or us. This vote will not create or imply any change to our fiduciary duties or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Board or us. However, the LDCC values the opinions that our shareowners express in their votes and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions on executive compensation, as it deems appropriate.
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareowners, 97.3 percent of the votes cast on the proposal were voted for the non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers. In light of that result, the Board of Directors implemented similar objectives, program and rationale for the compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal year 2018, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative as set forth in this Proxy Statement.
In addition, at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareowners a large majority of our shareowners approved, on a non-binding basis, the holding of the non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis. As previously disclosed, the Board and management determined to implement an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. As a result, we are including the non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers again in this Proxy Statement. See Item 2 on page 76 of this Proxy Statement.
Report of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
The LDCC has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement with management and, based on such review and discussion, the LDCC recommends to the Board that it be included in this Proxy Statement.
Dated: November 13, 2018
The "Report of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee" will not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference and will not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
Compensation Risk Assessment
As part of its oversight of our executive compensation program, the LDCC considers the impact of our executive compensation program, and the incentives created by the compensation awards that it administers, on our risk profile. In addition, we review all our compensation policies and procedures, including the incentives that they create and factors that may reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking, to determine whether they present a significant risk to us. At the LDCC's direction, FW Cook provided the LDCC with a risk assessment of our executive compensation policies and practices. Based on its independent assessment, FW Cook concluded that our compensation policies and practices for executives do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
The LDCC reviewed the findings of its own assessment, together with the FW Cook assessment, and concluded that our compensation programs are designed with the appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to our overall business strategy and that the balance of compensation elements discourages excessive risk-taking. The LDCC, therefore, determined that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The LDCC will continue to consider compensation risk implications while deliberating on the design of our executive compensation programs. In its discussions, the LDCC considered the attributes of our programs, including:
Executive Compensation
Summary Compensation Table
The following table provides information relating to total compensation for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as applicable. The individuals named below include our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our other named executive officers (as defined on page 36).
All Other Compensation Table
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table presents information regarding grants of plan-based awards to the named executive officers during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
2017 Stock Award and Incentive Plan
Shareowners approved the 2017 Plan at the Annual Meeting held in January 2017. The 2017 Plan authorizes a broad range of awards that the LDCC may grant at its discretion, including:
Executive officers and all other employees of the Company and our subsidiaries, non-management directors serving on the Board and others who provide substantial services to the Company and our subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible for awards under the 2017 Plan. The LDCC administers the 2017 Plan. The selection of participants and the nature and size of the awards granted to participants is subject to the LDCC's discretion. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 829,693 shares of Common Stock were subject to outstanding awards under our equity compensation plans and 2,643,369 shares of Common Stock were available for future awards under our equity compensation plans.
Consistent with the requirements of the NYSE, the 2017 Plan includes a restriction providing that we will not, without shareowner approval, amend or replace options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") previously granted under the 2017 Plan in a transaction that constitutes a "repricing".
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End
The following table presents information concerning the number and value of unexercised options, SARs and similar instruments, nonvested stock (including restricted stock, restricted stock units or other similar instruments) and incentive plan awards for the named executive officers outstanding as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018:
Option Exercises and Stock Vested
The following table presents information concerning the exercise of stock options, SARs and similar instruments and the vesting of stock (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and similar instruments) for the named executive officers during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Pension Benefits
We provide defined contribution and/or defined benefit retirement benefits to substantially all employees who meet vesting and other requirements. Our qualified defined benefit plan for non-represented employees is the Non-Represented Plan. Our qualified defined benefit plan for represented employees is the New Jersey Natural Gas Company Plan for Retirement Allowances for Represented Employees ("Represented Plan"). Our qualified defined contribution plan is our 401(k) Plan. All represented employees of NJRHS hired on or after October 1, 2000, all represented employees of NJNG hired on or after January 1, 2012 and all of our non-represented employees hired on or after October 1, 2009, are covered by an enhanced defined contribution plan feature of our 401(k) Plan instead of the Represented Plan or Non-Represented Plan. Three of our named executive officers participate in the Non-Represented Plan and each of our named executive officers participates in the 401(k) Plan. The retirement benefit under the Non-Represented Plan is based on years of service and highest 60-month average compensation.
In addition to the Non-Represented Plan, the Represented Plan and the 401(k) Plan, we sponsor the SEP and the PEP, both of which are non-qualified plans. Each of the named executive officers is or may become eligible for SEP benefits and three of our named executive officers are eligible for PEP benefits. Benefits will be paid under the PEP and the SEP to the extent that benefits are not payable by the Non-Represented Plan and the 401(k) due to the application of Sections 401(a)(17), 401(k), 401(m) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The PEP and the SEP are unfunded, with benefit payments paid from our corporate assets. We also sponsor health care plans that provide post-employment medical and life insurance benefits to union and non-union employees who meet the eligibility requirements. To be eligible, retirees must meet certain age and service requirements. Depending on the year of retirement, benefits may be subject to annual deductibles, coinsurance requirements and retiree contributions. As of September 30, 2018, with the exception of Mr. Downes, none of the named executive officers have completed the age and service requirements to be eligible for post-retirement health coverage.
The following table presents information concerning each of our defined benefit plans that provide for payments or other benefits to the named executive officers at, following or in connection with retirement. For each named executive officer, the present value of accumulated benefit in the table below was calculated using actuarial assumptions, including an interest rate of 4.35 percent as of September 30, 2018. The present value of the benefits was calculated assuming the named executive officers stay in employment until the earliest age the executive could collect a benefit without reduction for early retirement. The assumed age of payment is 60 for Messrs. Downes, Migliaccio and Westhoven. Mses. Mullan and Washington are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans.
Pension benefits are payable at age 65. Benefits may be paid as early as age 55 upon completion of 20 years of service. Benefits collected prior to age 60 and completion of 20 years of service (excluding disability retirements) are subject to early commencement reductions up to 50 percent, depending on age at the time of commencement.
The number of years of credited service for the named executive officers, assuming their continued employment by us until age 65, is set forth below:
To the extent benefits that would otherwise be payable to an employee under the Non-Represented Plan and the 401(k) Plan exceed the specified limits on such benefits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, we expect to pay such excess benefits to the employee at the time the employee receives payment under the respective plan. These excess benefit payments would be made from our general funds.
Supplemental Retirement Agreements
We have supplemental retirement agreements ("SERP Agreements") with each of the named executive officers and certain other officers not named in the Summary Compensation Table, payable over a five-year period commencing with retirement at age 65. At projected retirement, the total maximum amount payable to Mr. Downes under his SERP Agreement is currently $250,000. Messrs. Westhoven and Migliaccio and Mses. Mullan and Washington would each be entitled to maximum amounts of $125,000 under their respective SERP Agreements.
Defined Contribution Plan
We offer eligible employees the opportunity for participation in our 401(k) Plan. Generally, we match 65 percent of participants' contributions up to six percent of base compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code and 401(k) Plan limits. The matching contribution increased from 65 percent to 70 percent of the first six percent of compensation contributed as of January 1, 2016 for certain represented employees of NJRHS. The matching contribution is limited to 50 percent for certain represented employees of NJRHS who transferred from NJNG and are currently accruing pension benefits.
For represented NJRHS employees hired on or after October 1, 2000, represented employees of NJNG hired on or after January 1, 2012, and non-represented employees beginning employment after October 1, 2009, who are not eligible for participation in the defined benefit plans, we contribute between three and four percent of base compensation, depending on years of service, into the 401(k) Plan on their behalf.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The following table presents information concerning the NJR Officers' Deferred Compensation Plans that provide for the deferral of compensation of several of the named executive officers on a basis that is not tax qualified. We do not make matching contributions under these plans. For additional information with respect to our non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, please see "Compensation Discussion & Analysis — Deferred Compensation" on page 58 of this Proxy Statement.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
We believe our senior management and key employees are responsible for our success, and therefore it is important to provide reasonable protection to them in the event of a potential loss of employment following a change of control. It is our belief that the interests of shareowners will be best served if the interests of our senior management are aligned with them, and providing change of control benefits should offset any reluctance by senior management to pursue potential change of control transactions that may be in the best interests of shareowners. We also believe our arrangement facilitates the recruitment of talented executives by providing protections in the event we are acquired. We believe that relative to the overall value of any potential transaction, these potential change of control benefits are reasonable.
2017 Plan
Under the 2017 Plan, in the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the 2017 Plan), the Board may, among other things, accelerate the entitlement to outstanding benefits awarded thereunder. Pursuant to the 2017 Plan, a "change of control" will be deemed to have occurred if:
The 2017 Plan and all of the agreements for equity awards issued thereunder have a "double-trigger" vesting requirement for change of control vesting, which requires a qualified termination following a change of control before acceleration of vesting.
Supplemental Retirement Agreements
Pursuant to the SERP Agreements, we have with each of the named executive officers, in the event of a change of control, the right to the amounts payable to each of them becomes immediately vested and such amounts are immediately payable in the event of a subsequent termination of employment for any reason. A change of control is defined in the SERP Agreements as a reportable change of control under the proxy rules of the SEC, including the acquisition within a 12-month period of a 50 percent beneficial voting interest in us, or a change in any 12-month period in such number of directors as constitutes a majority of the Board, unless the election, or the nomination for election by our shareowners, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the year.
Employment Continuation Agreements
Our Employment Continuation Agreements provide each named executive officer certain rights in the event that his or her employment with us is terminated within two years following the occurrence of a change of control. A summary of the terms of these agreements is provided under "Severance Policies — Amended and Restated Employment Continuation Agreements" beginning on page 57 of this Proxy Statement.
The following tables summarize the value of the termination payments and benefits that our named executive officers would receive if their employment terminated on September 30, 2018, and the price per share of our Common Stock was $46.10, the closing market price on September 28, 2018, the last trading day of fiscal year 2018. The values in the tables are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to the named executive officers upon such termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such named executive officer's separation from the Company.
The tables exclude amounts accrued through September 30, 2018, which would be paid in the normal course of continued employment, such as accrued but unpaid salary and earned annual incentive award for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The table also excludes vested account balances under the 401(k) Plan, which are generally available to all of our salaried employees. In addition, the tables below reflect the hypothetical occurrence of both a change of control and a concurrent termination of a named executive officer in accordance with such named executive officer's Employment Continuation Agreement, assuming this event took place on September 30, 2018.
CEO Pay Ratio
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are disclosing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer to the annual total compensation of the individual we have identified as our median employee for this purpose. We believe that our pay ratio is a reasonable estimate and has been calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described below.
We identified our median employee based on fiscal year 2018 total cash compensation actually paid as of September 30, 2018 to all of our employees, other than our chief executive officer, who were employed on September 30, 2018. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, and we annualized the compensation of any permanent employee who was employed for less than the full 2018 fiscal year.
After identifying the median employee based on fiscal year 2018 total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology that we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the "Totals" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our chief executive officer), calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was $125,605. The annual total compensation of our chief executive officer was $4,553,524 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement. We reasonably estimate that the ratio of our chief executive officer's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was approximately 36:1.
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by the Company may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies and should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.
Non-Binding Proposal to Approve the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers
Item 2 On Proxy Card
The compensation of our named executive officers is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative set forth in this Proxy Statement.
The LDCC designs our named executive officers' compensation program to reward the achievement of our short-term and long-term objectives and to relate the compensation to the value created for our shareowners. We believe our compensation program also reflects competition and best practices in the marketplace. The mix of compensation components is competitive with that of other companies of similar size and operational characteristics, links compensation to individual and corporate performance and encourages stock ownership by senior management. Based on its review of the total compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018, the LDCC believes that the total compensation for each of the named executive officers is reasonable and effectively achieves the objectives of aligning compensation with performance measures directly related to our financial goals and creating shareowner value without encouraging our named executive officers to take unnecessary or excessive risks.
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, and the accompanying tables and narrative, provide a comprehensive review of our named executive officer compensation objectives, program and rationale. We urge you to read this disclosure before voting on this proposal.
For the reasons stated above, we are requesting your non-binding approval of the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareowners approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, the other related tables and the accompanying narrative."
This vote is provided as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. Your vote on this proposal will be non-binding on the Board and us and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or us. Your vote will not create or imply any change to our fiduciary duties or create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Board or us. However, the Board values the opinions that our shareowners express in their votes and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions, as it deems appropriate.
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Item 3 On Proxy Card
The shares represented by the proxies will be voted for approval of the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP (unless otherwise indicated on proxy) as our independent registered public accounting firm (the "auditors") to report to the shareowners on our financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. The Audit Committee approved in advance each professional service performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP during fiscal year 2018 and considered the possible effect on the auditors' independence. Information relating to fees paid to Deloitte & Touche LLP over the past two years is set forth below.
The Audit Committee has retained Deloitte & Touche LLP to report to the shareowners our financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Although submission of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm to shareowners for ratification is not required by law, the Board, consistent with its past policy, considers it appropriate to submit the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm for shareowner approval. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules of the SEC promulgated thereunder, the Audit Committee is solely responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock present, or represented by proxy, and voted at the Meeting is required for the approval of this item. The Board has not determined what action it would take if the shareowners do not approve the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP, but may reconsider its selection if the shareowners' action so warrants. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, exercising its own discretion, may select different auditors at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareowners.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
Aggregate fees billed to us for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, by our principal accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited and their respective affiliates (collectively, "Deloitte") are shown in the following table:
Audit Fees. Audit fees include professional services rendered by Deloitte for the audit of our annual financial statements, including its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting, the reviews of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and accounting consultations related to business transactions and adoption of new accounting standards. This category also includes fees for audits provided in connection with statutory filings or services that generally only the principal auditor can reasonably provide to a client and consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC.
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of amounts for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements that are not reported under "Audit Fees."
Tax Fees. Tax fees include original and amended tax returns, studies supporting tax return amounts as may be required by Internal Revenue Service regulations, claims for refunds, assistance with tax audits and other work directly affecting or supporting the payment of taxes, planning, research and advice supporting our efforts to maximize the tax efficiency of our operations for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
All Other Fees. All other fees are fees for products or services other than those in the above three categories. Amounts in this category primarily related to the use of accounting research tools and training seminars.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy
The Audit Committee has adopted a written policy for the provision of audit services and permitted non-audit services by our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Chief Financial Officer has primary responsibility to the Audit Committee for administration and enforcement of this policy and for reporting non-compliance. Under the policy, our Audit Committee receives a presentation of an annual budget and plan for audit services and for any proposed audit-related, tax or other non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The presentation must provide sufficient detail to clearly define the services included. Any services included within the budget and plan approved by the Audit Committee require no further Audit Committee approval for that budget year. The Audit Committee must approve all audit and permissible non-audit engagements of the independent registered public accounting firm in advance. The pre-approval requirements do not prohibit the delivery of permissible non-audit services that were not recognized as non-audit services at the time of the engagement if all such services are less than five percent of revenues paid to the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year and if those services are approved by the Audit Committee prior to completion of the audit.
AuditCommittee Report
In accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as required by the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the rules of the SEC. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Audit Committee met 10 times. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the interim financial information contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and discussed press releases announcing earnings with our Chief Financial Officer and the independent registered public accounting firm prior to public release.
The Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management or the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board, including the appointment, termination, compensation and oversight of the quality of the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviews the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's independence, the services provided and its fees, the selection of the lead engagement partner, as well as Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and peer review reports of its performance. The Company's management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an integrated audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
In discharging its oversight responsibility of the audit process, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm, required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the internal audit functions, organization, responsibilities, budget and staffing. The Audit Committee reviewed with both the independent and the internal auditors their audit plans, audit scope and identification of audit risks.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm all communications required by generally accepted auditing standards, including those described in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, which superseded the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (AICPA Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), as amended, "Communication with Audit Committees," as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T and, with and without management present, discussed and reviewed the results of the independent registered public accounting firm's examination of the financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed the results of the internal audit examinations.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's financial statements and the independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility for the audit of those statements.
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also reappointed Deloitte and Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.

Shareowners of record voting via telephone or over the Internet can choose this option by following the instructions provided by telephone or over the Internet, as applicable. Once given, a shareowner's consent will remain in effect until he or she revokes it by notifying our Corporate Secretary as described above. If you revoke your consent, we will begin sending you individual copies of future mailings of these documents within 30 days after we receive your revocation notice. Shareowners of record who elect to participate in householding may also request a separate copy of future proxy statements and annual reports by contacting our Corporate Secretary in writing at Office of the Corporate Secretary, New Jersey Resources Corporation, 1415 Wyckoff Road, Wall, New Jersey 07719 or by telephone at (732) 938-7890.
Separate Copies for Beneficial Owners
Institutions that hold shares in street name for two or more beneficial owners with the same address are permitted to deliver a single proxy statement and annual report to that address. Any such beneficial owner can request a separate copy of this Proxy Statement or the Annual Report on Form 10-K by contacting our Corporate Secretary.
