What Constitutes a Quorum?

The full text of our "Policy Regarding Director Recommendations by Stockholders" and "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Directorship Guidelines and Selection Policy" are published on our website at www.homebancshares.com and can be found under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
How Can I Communicate Directly with the Board? 
Shareholder communications to the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, or any individual director must be sent in writing via certified U.S. mail to the Corporate Secretary at the following address: 
Home BancShares, Inc. 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
P.O. Box 966 
Conway, Arkansas 72033 
Our "Stockholder Communications Policy" is published on the Company's website at www.homebancshares.com and can be found under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
How Do I Vote? 
The enclosed proxy card indicates the number of shares you own. There are four ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet at the website shown on your proxy card; we encourage you to vote this way.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By toll-free telephone at the number shown on your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By completing and mailing your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By written ballot at the Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you vote by Internet or telephone, your vote must be received by 1:00 a.m. Central time on April 18, 2019. If your shares are held in "street name," the instructions from your broker or nominee will indicate whether Internet or telephone voting is available and, if so, will provide details regarding how to use those systems. If you complete and properly sign the accompanying proxy card and return it to the Company, or tender your vote via telephone or the Internet, it will be voted as you direct. If you do not indicate your voting preferences, Brian S. Davis and Jennifer C. Floyd will vote your shares FOR all of the director nominees and FOR Proposals 2, 3 and 4.  If You Vote by Telephone or on the Internet, You Do NOT Need to Return Your Proxy Card. 
If you plan to attend the Meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. However, if your shares are held in "street name" and you wish to vote your shares by written ballot at the Meeting, you will need to request and obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee (the stockholder of record) giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting, complete such legal proxy and present it to the Company at the Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy card or voting instructions in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Meeting. 
A proxy duly executed and returned by a shareholder, and not revoked prior to or at the Meeting, will be voted in accordance with the shareholder's instructions on such proxy. 
If My Shares Are Held By a Broker or Nominee, Do I Need to Instruct the Broker or Nominee How to Vote My Shares? 
Yes. If you hold shares in "street name" through a broker or other nominee, your broker or nominee may not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to some of the matters to be acted upon. Under current stock exchange rules, brokers who do not have instructions from their customers may not use their discretion in voting their customers' shares on certain specific matters which are not considered to be "routine" matters, including the election of directors, executive compensation and other significant matters. The proposals in this Proxy Statement to elect directors and to approve on an advisory basis the Company's executive compensation are not considered to be routine matters. Thus, if you do not give your broker or nominee specific instructions with respect to each of these matters, your shares may not be voted on those matters and will not be counted in determining the number of shares necessary for approval. Shares represented by such "broker non-votes" will, however, be counted in determining whether there is a quorum. 
The approval of an amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock and the ratification of BKD, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are considered routine matters, and therefore, if you do not give your broker or nominee specific instructions with respect to these proposals, your broker or nominee will have the discretionary authority to vote your shares on these proposals. 
What Are the Board's Recommendations? 
Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. The Board's recommendation is set forth together with each proposal in this Proxy Statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of the nominated slate of directors (see pages  6-37).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of  the Company's compensation of its named executive officers (see page 38).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the approval of the amendment to the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as  amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000 (see pages 39-40).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of BKD, LLP as the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm (see pages 41-43).  
[END TABLE]
What Other Business May Be Brought Before the Meeting? 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board knows of no other business that may properly be, or is likely to be, brought before the Annual Meeting. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Meeting, the proxy holders will vote as recommended by the Board of Directors or, if no recommendation is given, at their own discretion.  What Vote Is Required to Approve Each Proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Election of Directors. The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy  at the Annual Meeting is required for the election of directors. A properly executed proxy marked "WITHHOLD" with respect to the election of one or more of the directors will not be voted with respect to the director or directors  indicated, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Proposals. For each other proposal, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in  person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, assuming a quorum is present, will be required for approval. A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to any such matter will not be voted, although it will be counted for purposes  of determining whether there is a quorum. Accordingly, an abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.  
[END TABLE]
The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares at $0.01 par value. As of the close of business on February 8, 2019, there were 170,096,572 shares eligible to vote. 
Can I Change My Vote After I Return the Proxy Card? 
Yes. Even after you have submitted your proxy, you may change your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised by filing with the Secretary of the Company either a notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. The powers of the proxy holders will be suspended if you attend the Meeting in person and so request, although attendance at the Meeting will not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy. 
What Should I Do If I Receive More Than One Set Of Voting Materials? 
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and multiple proxies or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account. If you are a registered owner and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote each proxy and instruction card that you receive. 
Where Can I Find The Voting Results Of The Annual Meeting? 
The Company will publish final voting results of the Annual Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days after the Annual Meeting on April 18, 2019. 
What Do I Need To Do Now? 
First, read this Proxy Statement carefully. Then, if you are a registered owner of shares of our common stock as of February 8, 2019, you should, as soon as possible, submit your proxy by executing and returning the proxy card or by voting by telephone or on the Internet. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," then you should follow the voting instructions of your broker or other nominee. Your shares will be voted in accordance with the directions you specify. If you submit an executed proxy card to the Company but fail to specify voting directions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. 
You Should Carefully Read this Proxy Statement in its Entirety.  PROPOSAL ONE – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that the number of directors shall not be less than two nor more than fifteen, with the exact number to be fixed by the shareholders or the Board. The Board of Directors proposes that the nominees for directors described below be elected for a term of one year and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. All nominees are currently serving as directors. 
Each of the nominees has consented to serve the term for which he or she is nominated. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election, which is not anticipated, the directors' proxies will vote for the election of such other person as the Board may nominate, unless the Board resolves to reduce the number of directors to serve on the Board and thereby reduce the number of directors to be elected at the meeting. 
The Board of Directors Recommends that Shareholders Vote

Duties of the Board 
The Board of Directors has the responsibility to serve as the trustee for the shareholders. It also has the responsibility for establishing broad corporate policies and for the overall performance of the Company. The Board, however, is not involved in day-to-day operating details. Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company's business through discussion with the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other officers, by reviewing analyses and reports sent to them quarterly, and by participating in Board and Committee meetings. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Policies 
We believe that good corporate governance helps ensure that the Company is managed for the long-term benefit of its shareholders. We continue to review our corporate governance policies and practices, corporate governance rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market on which our common stock is traded. The Board has adopted various corporate governance guidelines and policies to assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities to the Company and its shareholders. The guidelines and policies address, among other items, director independence and director qualifications. You can access and print our corporate governance guidelines and policies, including the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Corporate Code of Ethics for Directors, Executive Officers and Employees and other Company policies and procedures required by applicable law or regulation, on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
Director Independence 
NASDAQ rules require that a majority of the directors of NASDAQ-listed companies be "independent." An "independent director" generally means a person other than an officer or employee of the listed company or its subsidiaries, or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the listed company's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Certain categories of persons are deemed not to be independent under the NASDAQ rules, such as persons employed by the listed company within the last three years, and persons who have received (or whose immediate family members have received) payments exceeding a specified amount from the listed company within the last three years, excluding payments that are not of a disqualifying nature (such as compensation for board service, payments arising solely from investments in the listed company's securities, and benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan). NASDAQ rules impose somewhat more stringent independence requirements on persons who serve as members of the audit committee or the compensation committee of a listed company. 
Of the fifteen persons who currently serve on our Board of Directors, we believe that Messrs. Adams, Adcock, Ashley, Beebe, Engelkes, Hinkle, Lieblong, Longe, Rankin and Mrs. Garrett are "independent" for purposes of NASDAQ rules. Messrs. Allison, Davis, French and Sims and Ms. Townsell are not considered independent because they are officers of Home BancShares. The Board has also determined that no member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has any material relationship with the Company (either directly or indirectly as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) and that all members of these committees meet the criteria for independence under the NASDAQ listing standards. 
Board Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors has since 2009 separated the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The primary purpose of installing a separate CEO in addition to the Chairman was to facilitate and strengthen the succession of management of the Company. This separation of Chairman and CEO also allows for greater oversight of the Company by the Board. The Board is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect the Company. This oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, as disclosed in the description of each of the committees below and in the charters of each of the committees, but the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committee's considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company.  Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers, and employees. We believe our Code of Ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of conflicts of interest, full, fair and accurate disclosure in filings and other public communications made by us, compliance with applicable laws, prompt internal reporting of ethics violations, and accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics. This Code of Ethics is published in its entirety on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." We will post on our website any amendment to this code and any waivers of any provision of this code made for the benefit of any of our senior executive officers or directors. 
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD 
The business of the Company is managed under the direction of the Board of Directors, who meet on a regularly scheduled basis during the calendar year to review significant developments affecting the Company and to act on matters that require Board approval. Special meetings are also held when Board action is required on matters arising between regularly scheduled meetings. Written consents to action without a meeting may be obtained if the Company deems it more appropriate. 
All members of the Board are strongly encouraged to attend each meeting of the Board and meetings of the Board committees on which they serve, as well as the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors held four regularly scheduled meetings and one special meeting during calendar year 2018. During this period each of our current Board members participated in at least 75% of the aggregate of the meetings of the Board and the Board committees on which the director served during the period in which the member served as a director, with the exception of Mr. Lieblong. In addition, all of the current Board members attended the Company's Annual Meeting in 2018. Our "Director Attendance Policy" is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
Our Board of Directors has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Asset/Liability Committee. Committee members are elected annually by the Board and serve until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. 
The following table discloses the Board members who serve on each of the Board's committees and the number of meetings held by each committee during calendar year 2018.

The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee that meets the applicable standards of the SEC and NASDAQ. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
The Audit Committee is comprised of Jack E. Engelkes, Chairman, Milburn Adams, Robert H. Adcock, Jr., James G. Hinkle, Karen E. Garrett, Thomas J. Longe and Alex R. Lieblong. The Board has determined that each member of the Committee satisfies the independence requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards, that each member of the Committee is financially literate, knowledgeable and qualified to review financial statements, and that Mr. Engelkes and Mrs. Garrett each has the attributes of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the regulations of the SEC. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee aids the Board in discharging its responsibility with respect to the compensation of our executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee is responsible for evaluating and approving the Company's compensation plans and policies and for communicating the Company's compensation policies to shareholders in our annual proxy statement. In fulfilling its duties, the Compensation Committee, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee that meets the applicable standards of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Compensation Committee Charter is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
The Compensation Committee is comprised of Mike D. Beebe, Chairman, Milburn Adams, Richard H. Ashley, Jack E. Engelkes and Jim Rankin, Jr. The Board has determined that each member of the Committee satisfies the independence requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards and qualifies and as an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and as a "nonemployee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
The Compensation Committee charter authorizes the Committee to delegate to subcommittees of the Committee any responsibility the Committee deems necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall not, however, delegate to a subcommittee any power or authority required by any law, regulation or listing standard to be exercised by the Committee as a whole.     
The Chairman, after consulting with executive officers and others, makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the form and amount of compensation paid to each executive officer. Additionally, the Chairman, our Chief Operating Officer ("COO") and the CEO of our bank subsidiary attend the Committee meetings and answer questions and provide information to the Committee as requested. This normally includes a history of the primary compensation components for each executive officer, including an internal pay equity analysis. The Committee then considers the recommendations of the Chairman, the information provided by the COO and the CEO of our bank subsidiary, historical compensation of each executive, and other factors. Based on this information, the Committee sets the compensation for the executive officers and reports its decisions to the Board of Directors. The executive officers do not make any recommendations with regard to director compensation. Although the executive officers are involved in the process of evaluating compensation, including their own, the final decision is made by the Committee or the Board. The Committee understands the inherent conflict in obtaining information from the Chairman and executive officers, but believes that this information is valuable in determining the appropriate compensation. The CEO is not present during the Committee's deliberations or voting regarding his compensation. 
Historically, the Committee meets subsequent to year end to finalize discussion regarding the Company's performance goals for the previous and current year with respect to performance-based compensation to be paid to executive officers and to approve its report for the annual proxy statement. These goals are approved within 90 days of the beginning of the year. Each year in December and/or January, the Committee generally discusses any new compensation issues, the compensation, bonus and incentive plan award analyses and the engagement of a compensation consultant for annual executive and director compensation. The Committee also meets in December and/or January to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and discuss the recommendations made by the Chairman;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review the performance of the Company and the individual officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review the level to which the Company's performance goals were attained and approve short-term cash bonus  and long-term incentive awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determine the executive officers' base salaries for the following year.  
[END TABLE]
Management also advises the full Board, including the Committee members, throughout the year of new issues and developments regarding executive compensation.

The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that meets the applicable standards of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is comprised of Alex R. Lieblong, Chairman, Robert H. Adcock, Jr., Thomas J. Longe and Jim Rankin, Jr. The Board has determined that all members of the Committee satisfy independence requirements of the NASDAQ listing standards. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met on January 18, 2019, to select director nominees (except Ms. Townsell, who was subsequently nominated by the Board) to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
Director Candidate Qualifications 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Directorship Guidelines and Selection Policy outlines the qualifications the Committee looks for in a director nominee. Generally, the candidate should possess: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• relevant business and financial expertise and experience, including an understanding of fundamental financial  statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the highest character and integrity and a reputation for working constructively with others;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sufficient time to devote to meetings and consultation on Board matters; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• freedom from conflicts of interest that would interfere with performance as a director.  
[END TABLE]
More specifically, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates who possess various qualifications, skills, or other factors it deems appropriate. These factors may include leadership experience in business or other relevant fields, knowledge of the Company and the financial services industry, experience in serving as a director of another financial institution or public company generally, education, wisdom, integrity, analytical ability, familiarity with and participation in the communities served by the Company and its subsidiaries, commitment to and availability for services as a director, and any other factors the Committee deems relevant. 
In addition, the Board of Directors has adopted a policy under which a director will not be eligible to stand for re-election once he or she has reached 75 years of age or if he or she will reach the age of 75 during the first six months of the calendar year in which he or she is to stand for re-election. However, our Board of Directors has granted a waiver of this mandatory retirement age to Milburn Adams until the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Director Nominations Process 
After assessing and considering prevailing business conditions of the Company, legal and listing standard requirements for Board composition, the size and composition of the current Board, and the skills and experience of current Board members, any of the Chairman, the Nominating Committee or any Board member may identify the need to add a Board member or to fill a vacancy on the Board. The Committee identifies qualified director nominees from among persons known to the members of the Committee, by reputation or otherwise, and through referrals from trusted sources, including senior management, existing Board members, shareholders and independent consultants hired for such purpose. The Committee may request that senior officers of the Company assist the Committee in identifying and assessing prospective candidates who meet the criteria established by the Board. The Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company's policy regarding director recommendations by shareholders. This policy is described above under the caption "Can a Shareholder Nominate a Director?" and is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." The Committee intends to evaluate any candidate recommended by a shareholder in the same manner in which it evaluates candidates recommended by other sources, according to the criteria described below.  The Nominating Committee evaluates candidates based upon the candidate's qualifications, recommendations, or other relevant information, which may include a personal interview. The Nominating Committee has determined that the Board as a whole must have the right diversity, mix of characteristics and skills for the optimal functioning of the Board in its oversight of the Company. The Board believes it should be comprised of persons with skills in areas such as banking, finance, accounting, sales and marketing, law, strategic planning and leadership of large, complex organizations. The Nominating Committee prefers a mix of background and experience among the Board's members but does not follow any ratio or formula to determine the appropriate mix. Rather, it uses its judgment to identify nominees whose backgrounds, attributes and experiences, taken as a whole, will contribute to the high standards of Board service to the Company. 
In addition to the targeted skill areas, the Nominating Committee looks for a strong record of achievement in key knowledge areas that it believes are critical for directors to add value to a Board including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategy – knowledge of the Company's business model, the formulation of corporate strategies,  knowledge of key competitors and banking markets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leadership – skills in coaching senior executives and the ability to assist in their development;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Organizational issues – understanding of strategy implementation, management processes, group effectiveness  and organizational design;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relationships – understanding how to interact with investors, regulatory bodies, and communities in which  the Company operates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Functional – understanding of finance matters, financial statements and auditing procedures, technical  expertise, legal issues, information technology and marketing; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ethics – the ability to identify and raise key ethical issues concerning the activities of the Company and  senior management as they affect the business community and society.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee meets to consider and approve the candidates to be presented to the Board. The Committee then presents its proposed nominees to the full Board. The Board considers the recommendations of the Committee and approves candidates for nomination. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Directorship Guidelines and Selection Policy is published on our website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
Asset/Liability Committee

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Banking Transactions. Most of our directors and officers, as well as the firms and businesses with which they or members of their immediate families are associated, are customers of our bank subsidiary. Our bank subsidiary has engaged in a variety of loan transactions in the ordinary course of business with individuals and their families and businesses, and it is anticipated that such transactions will occur in the future. In the case of all such related party transactions in 2018, each transaction was approved by either the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors or the bank subsidiary's board of directors. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to us. In the opinion of our management, those loan transactions do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
We believe that all extensions of credit by our bank subsidiary to its directors and officers and to directors and officers of the Company, either directly or as guarantors, were made in conformity with the requirements of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount outstanding on these loans, including available borrowings, was approximately $56.6 million, of which approximately $39.4 million was attributable to the largest borrowing relationship. None of these loans are non-accrual, past due 90 days or more, restructured or potential problems. 
Other Transactions. We lease certain properties from persons who are members of our Board. During 2018, the aggregate payments we made, directly or indirectly, to each of these directors for the various leases were less than $120,000. We believe the terms of each of these transactions are no less favorable to us than we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party. 
We expect we will continue to engage in similar banking and business transactions in the ordinary course of business with our directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their associates. All proposed related party transactions are presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors for consideration and approval. The Committee does not currently have any formal policies or procedures with respect to its review, approval, or ratification of related party transactions, but considers each related party transaction or proposed related party transaction on a case-by-case basis. According to its charter, the Committee follows the definition of "related party transaction" provided in the SEC's regulations under the Securities Act of 1933. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires each director, officer, and any individual beneficially owning more than 10 percent of the Company's common stock to file reports on Forms 3, 4, and 5 disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the common stock of the Company with the SEC within specified time frames. These specified time frames require Form 3 filings to be made within 10 days after the person becomes a reporting person. Changes in ownership generally must be filed on Form 4 within two business days of the transaction. Based solely on information provided to the Company by individual directors and officers, we believe that all our Section 16 filers complied with the filing requirements during the fiscal year, except that one Form 4 to report the purchase of shares of common stock by Milburn Adams and two Form 4 filings to report a sale and two purchases, respectively, of shares of common stock by Jim Rankin, Jr. were not filed timely.  PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY 
The following table sets forth certain information as of January 31, 2019, concerning the number and percentage of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by our directors, our named executive officers, and all of our directors and executive officers as a group, and by each person known to us who beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
Information in this table is based upon "beneficial ownership" concepts described in the rules issued under the Exchange Act. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of any shares of our common stock if that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of the shares, or "investment power," which includes the right to dispose or direct the disposition of the shares. Thus, under the rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same shares. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any shares as to which that person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days from January 31, 2019. 
Except as otherwise indicated, all shares are owned directly, and the named person possesses sole voting and investment power with respect to his or her shares. The address for each of our directors and named executive officers is c/o Home BancShares, Inc., 719 Harkrider Street, Suite 100, Conway, Arkansas 72032.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Summary 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information regarding the Company's compensation program for our "named executive officers." Our "named executive officers" for 2018 are C. Randall Sims, CEO and President, Brian S. Davis, CFO and Treasurer, John W. Allison, Chairman of the Board, Tracy M. French, CEO and President of our bank subsidiary, and Kevin D. Hester, Chief Lending Officer ("CLO"). Specific information regarding the compensation paid to each named executive officer is disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table and the other compensation tables that follow beginning on page 31 of this proxy statement. All references to shares of our common stock and to our diluted earnings per share in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and in the tables and narrative that follow under "Executive Compensation" have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 split of our common stock paid to our shareholders on June 8, 2016. The discussion below includes an overview of our compensation philosophy and guiding principles, the components of our executive compensation, and a summary of our executive compensation awards for 2018. 
Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain key management for the Company and our bank subsidiary, motivate high performance with a view toward long-term growth and success of the Company, and align management with the interests of our shareholders. Our executive compensation consists of base salary, short-term cash bonus incentive awards, long-term equity incentive awards, retirement and insurance benefit plans and certain perquisites. The short-term incentive awards are based on the Company's or our bank subsidiary's financial performance compared with the Company's or the bank's strategic goals for each year or on the executive's contributions to other operational achievements during the year. Our long-term incentive awards, which may be granted on a fixed basis or a performance basis tied to annual and/or multi-year cumulative performance goals of the Company or our bank subsidiary, encourage the alignment of senior management's goals with those of our shareholders, with the ultimate goal of increasing overall shareholder value. The opportunity to earn annual cash bonus awards and long-term equity awards provides a mix of variable compensation that integrates the Company's short-term and long-term goals, as well as helps to attract and retain executive officers. 
Salary payments to our named executive officers during 2018 ranged from $310,000 to $450,000, which compares to a range of $295,000 to $410,000 in 2017. For 2018, we paid annual cash bonuses to each of the named executive officers in amounts ranging from 8.1% to 111.5% of the executive's 2018 base salary. These cash bonus awards were based primarily on the officers' contributions to the Company's substantial net income growth in 2018 of $165.3 million, or 122.4%, the completion of the acquisition of Shore Premier Finance and being named the top bank on Forbes' 2018 "Best Banks in America" list. 
The Compensation Committee utilizes the Company's Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan for issuing long-term equity incentive awards to our executive officers as a means to reward past performance, provide a long-term incentive for future performance and align management with the interests of our shareholders. The Committee uses long-term equity incentive awards most frequently in the compensation of our Chairman, Mr. Allison, to maintain close alignment between his interests and those of our shareholders and to reward his leadership in the growth and success of the Company. Mr. Allison remains the Company's largest individual shareholder, owning 3.92% of our outstanding common stock. The Compensation Committee has historically issued annual awards of restricted shares of our common stock to our Chairman, including in each of the past three years. These awards have primarily reflected and provided incentive for Mr. Allison's continued leadership in connection with the Company's successful bank acquisitions and strong financial performance during this period and the preceding years. In 2018, the Committee awarded Mr. Allison 125,000 restricted shares to vest in two installments over a three-year period. In January 2019, the Committee granted Mr. Allison 150,000 restricted shares to vest in three annual installments over a three-year period.  The Compensation Committee also periodically issues long-term equity incentive awards to our other named executive officers, with its recent practice being to issue such awards approximately every three years. The Committee utilizes both stock options and restricted shares subject to either time-based vesting or performance goals, or a combination of performance-based and time-based vesting. In July 2018, the Committee granted equity incentive awards to Messrs. Sims, Davis, French and Hester and other key Company and bank employees. The awards to our named executive officers represent an aggregate of 375,000 shares of our common stock consisting of 125,000 performance-based restricted shares and 250,000 performance-based stock options. Vesting of these awards is subject to the Company's achievement of average adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 per share for four consecutive quarters or $2.00 total adjusted diluted earnings per share over four consecutive quarters, with vesting to occur over a five-year period following attainment of the performance goal. The Committee issued similar equity awards to Messrs. Davis, French and Hester in August 2015 representing an aggregate of 480,000 shares of our common stock consisting of restricted shares, performance-based restricted shares and performance-based stock options. Vesting of these awards was subject to a specified diluted earnings per share goal, which was met on December 31, 2016, and additional fixed vesting over a five-year period following the achievement of the performance goal. From time to time, the Committee grants additional restricted stock and stock option awards to our named executive officers, other than our Chairman, in certain circumstances. No such awards were granted in 2018. 
The Committee believes its practices with respect to the issuance of equity awards to our named executive officers provide appropriate long-term performance incentives and further align the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. 
Overview of Compensation Philosophy and Program 
The Compensation Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, administers the Company's executive compensation program. The role of the Committee is to oversee the Company's compensation and benefit plans and policies, administer its stock plans, and review and approve annually all compensation decisions related to the named executive officers and our Board members. The Committee reports its compensation decisions to the Board for their review or recommends such decisions for approval by the Board. 
The Committee recognizes the importance of compensation and performance and seeks to reward performance with cost-effective compensation that aligns employee efforts with the business strategy of the Company and with the interest of the shareholders. The Committee also recognizes that the compensation should assist the Company in attracting and retaining key executives critical to its long-term success. 
The following principles guide the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation levels should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain key management for the bank and  holding company. The Company hires experienced bank executives that have a track record in the market. Competition is strong for these talented and experienced people. The compensation package must be strong and competitive in that market.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation should relate directly to performance and responsibility. Compensation should vary with the  performance and responsibility of the individual. It should always be proportional to the contribution to the Company's success.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentive compensation should motivate high performance. The Company uses the cash bonus plan  to motivate individuals with roles and responsibilities that give them the ability to directly impact the Company's performance and strategic direction. The incentive compensation should not cause the individual to take excessive and  unnecessary risks that would threaten the institution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan should align management with shareholders'  interests. Awards of stock options, restricted stock or other forms of long-term compensation should encourage management to focus on the long-term growth and success of the Company. It should provide management with a meaningful stake in the  Company and the prospects of a long-term career.  
[END TABLE]
 The Committee receives updates on our business results from management and reviews historical and projected financial information as necessary to assess whether executive compensation continues to be properly balanced with and supportive of our business objectives. The Committee may also review information, including reported revenue, profit levels, market capitalization and disclosed governance practices, regarding comparably-sized bank holding companies in a peer group to assess our comparative performance and organizational structure. The Committee uses management updates and peer information as tools to evaluate the connection between executive compensation and our performance as a business. This information is reviewed in a subjective manner. There is no implied direct or formulaic linkage between peer information and our compensation decisions. The Committee takes the view that appropriate connections between compensation and performance objectives can encourage our executives to make decisions that will result in significant positive short-term and long-term returns for our business and our shareholders without providing an incentive either to take unnecessary risks or to avoid opportunities to achieve long-term benefits even though they may reduce short-term benefits for the named executive officers, the business or our shareholders. 
Based on these reports and assessments, the Committee annually evaluates both the short-term and long-term performance compensation for the named executive officers to ensure alignment with our business objectives. The Committee also works closely with management regarding long-term equity incentives, including performance-based equity awards, which emphasize shareholder returns while providing enhanced retention value for key executives. 
Benchmarking Against A Peer Group 
The Committee in the past has compared total compensation levels for the executive officers to the compensation paid to executives in a peer group. The Committee annually considers the need for a peer analysis and reviews peer compensation as the Committee deems necessary. The Committee did not perform a peer compensation review or engage a compensation consultant during 2018 to advise the Committee on setting the compensation of our executive officers. For 2018, the Committee evaluated and considered the overall performance and achievements of the Company and our bank subsidiary, as well as each executive's individual performance and the Chairman's recommendation for such executive (other than himself). 
Consideration of Shareholder Advisory "Say-on-Pay" Vote 
At our Annual Meeting in 2018, the shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers for 2017, as disclosed in last year's proxy statement (91.4% of votes cast). We value this endorsement by our shareholders of our executive compensation policies. The Committee has considered the results of this advisory vote on executive compensation, and we have followed the same philosophy in determining our current executive compensation of maintaining competitive executive pay that rewards performance and encourages management to focus on the long-term growth and success of the Company by providing them an equity stake in the Company that aligns their interests with our shareholders. The Company has included in this Proxy Statement a similar proposal providing for an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our executives in accordance with the shareholders' recommendation. See "PROPOSAL TWO – ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION." 
Components of Compensation 
The key elements of the Company's executive compensation program are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term incentives (bonuses)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation (options/restricted stock)

[END TABLE]
The Company tries to determine the proper mix of base, short-term and long-term incentive compensation. In our markets there are a number of national, regional and community banks. The competition for experienced executives in banking is strong. The Committee understands that being a public company that can offer equity incentives and a community banking philosophy puts the Company in a competitive position for strong management. The public market for the stock and its easily accessible value is a positive factor in aligning management's interest with that of the shareholders and making them meaningful stakeholders.  Base Salary 
Base salaries historically have been targeted at comparable levels for peer companies and adjusted to recognize varying levels of responsibility, individual performance, individual banking region performance if appropriate and internal equity issues. The Committee reviews the base salaries of the executive officers annually. This base salary provides the foundation for a total compensation package that is required to attract, retain and motivate the officers. Generally, base salaries are not directly related to specific measures of performance, but are determined by experience, the scope and complexity of the position, current job responsibilities, and salaries of competing banks. The Committee did not use benchmarking in 2018. Base salaries for our named executive officers in 2018 ranged from $310,000 for Mr. Sims as CEO of the holding company to $450,000 for Mr. French as CEO of our bank subsidiary, which reflect increases of approximately 5% to 10% over our named executive officers' base salaries in 2017. Base salaries for our named executive officers for 2019, approved by the Committee in January 2019, reflect an increase of 12.5% for our Chairman and increases of approximately 2.0% for each other named executive officer. 
Short-term Incentives 
An annual cash bonus plan is intended to reward individual performance for that year. The Compensation Committee evaluates a number of performance criteria for the Company or the bank and considers the overall profitability of the Company and our bank subsidiary before determining the awards. Specifically, the Committee reviews the individual performance of the officer, along with the goals and performance of the Company and the bank relative to the officer's role and responsibilities. For named executives who are officers of our bank subsidiary, the Committee reviews criteria such as return on assets, growth in assets (including through acquisitions), asset quality, return on equity, gross margin, net income, operating income, net cash flow and regulatory examination results. In evaluating an executive officer of the parent, the Committee reviews the goals of the parent company including shareholder return, earnings per share, and the other criteria noted above. The final consideration is the overall profitability of the Company. The Committee then determines the amount of the awards. In each case, the Committee makes the determination at their discretion as to the issuance and amount of any award. 
The Committee awarded annual cash bonuses for 2018 to each of our named executive officers in amounts ranging from 8.1% to 111.5% of the executive's 2018 base salary. These cash bonus awards were based primarily on the officers' contributions to the Company's substantial net income growth in 2018 of $165.3 million, or 122.4%, the completion of the acquisition of Shore Premier Finance and being named the top bank on Forbes' 2018 "Best Banks in America" list. 
Long-term Incentives 
Consistent with the Company's philosophy that favors compensation based upon performance, long-term incentives comprise a significant component of total compensation. In 2012, the Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). In 2016 and 2018, the shareholders approved amendments to the Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan, and in 2017, the shareholders reapproved the material terms of the performance goals under the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain highly qualified officers, directors, and key employees, and to encourage those employees to improve our business results. The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may select participants to receive awards, determine the types, terms and conditions of awards and interpret provisions of the Plan. 
It is the policy of the Committee to award grants with an exercise price set at the fair market value on the date of the grant. The Company does not have a practice of timing option or restricted stock grants to coordinate with the release of material non-public information. The Committee evaluates opportunities under the Plan along with the annual setting of salaries and awarding bonuses. The Committee will also consider awards under the Plan if appropriate in recruiting a new employee. 
The Committee has historically used one or more of the following business criteria, on a consolidated basis and/or with respect to specified banking regions (except with respect to the total shareholder return and earnings per share criteria), in establishing performance goals for performance-based awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shareholder return;  
[END TABLE]

• growth in assets;

• operating income.  
[END TABLE]
Prior to 2018, the Company's stock option grants and certain restricted stock awards to covered employees were generally intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) places a limit of $1,000,000 on the compensation that a publicly held corporation may deduct in any one year with respect to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers whose compensation is required to be disclosed in the company's annual proxy statement (referred to as covered employees). Historically, there was an exception to this $1,000,000 limitation for performance-based compensation that meets certain requirements, and the principal financial officer was excluded from the definition of a covered employee. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended Section 162(m) to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation and to make compensation paid to the principal financial officer now subject to the $1,000,000 deduction limitation. The amendments to Section 162(m) include a grandfather clause applicable to compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not materially modified after such date. The Compensation Committee does not have a specific policy with regard to Section 162(m). However, the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan contains certain provisions designed to facilitate the deductibility of performance-based compensation in accordance with Section 162(m). The Company generally believes its stock option and performance-based restricted stock awards granted before November 2, 2017 have met those requirements and, as such, are deductible. 
Historically, the Committee has granted both regular and performance-based nonqualified stock options. Awards granted on a regular (or fixed) basis carry a set vesting schedule based on a certain time period as determined by the Committee. Performance-based awards are payable in recognition of achievement of certain annual and/or cumulative performance goals of the Company or our bank subsidiary based on one or more of the criteria described above over a period of time longer than one year. The Committee may also grant restricted stock under the Plan based on the criteria described above. The restricted period for such shares may be subject to the satisfaction of Company or individual performance objectives but may not be less than one year. If the restricted shares are not subject to any such performance objectives, the restricted period may not be less than three years. 
Under the Plan, the Committee must certify in writing that all of the performance goals and other material terms of a performance-based award have been met before the named executive officer may receive payment for such award. The performance-based awards have historically been based on quarterly, annual and/or cumulative diluted earnings per share or asset growth targets. The Committee may confer with the Audit Committee as necessary when confirming achievement of performance goals. The equity awards (both fixed and performance-based) typically have been based on a vesting period of three to five years. 
Generally, the Committee utilizes annual restricted stock awards in the compensation of our Chairman, Mr. Allison, who remains the Company's largest individual shareholder, owning 3.92% of our outstanding common stock. The Committee believes these awards help maintain close alignment of our Chairman's interests with those of our shareholders and appropriately reward his leadership in the growth and success of the Company. The Committee issues long-term equity incentive awards to our other named executive officers on a less frequent basis, with its recent practice being to issue substantial equity awards to the executive group approximately every three years and selected awards from time to time to individual executives. 
During the past three years, the Committee has granted restricted shares of our common stock to Mr. Allison in the amounts of 125,000 shares in January 2018, 112,500 shares in February 2017 and 140,000 shares in January 2016. In addition, the Committee awarded Mr. Allison 10,000 unrestricted bonus shares of our common stock in 2016 in lieu of a cash bonus for 2015. The restricted shares granted in 2018 vest over three years in two equal installments beginning on the second anniversary of the grant date. This award was based primarily on the Company's completion of three acquisitions, including the largest in the Company's history, and strong adjusted earnings in 2017. The 2017 award is subject to both performance and time-based conditions under which the shares will "cliff" vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if either the Company's total assets equal or exceed $12.5 billion at any fiscal quarter end within the three-year period or the Company has averaged $0.315 diluted earnings per share for four consecutive quarters or $1.26 total diluted earnings per share over a period of four consecutive quarters within the three-year period. The alternative total asset growth and diluted earnings per share goals were designed to provide incentive toward the successful completion of the Company's two then-pending acquisitions and the successful negotiation and completion of the Stonegate acquisition, along with maintaining strong quarterly   earnings. The total asset growth performance goal was met on September 30, 2017, and therefore, these shares will vest on February 22, 2020. The restricted shares granted to Mr. Allison in 2016 "cliff" vested on January 25, 2019. This award was based on his leadership in connection with our 2015 acquisitions, the formation of Centennial Commercial Finance Group, and the Company's overall financial performance in 2015. 
On January 18, 2019, the Committee awarded to Mr. Allison 150,000 restricted shares of our common stock to vest in three equal annual installments beginning on January 18, 2020. 
In July 2018, the Committee granted long-term equity incentive awards to Messrs. Sims, Davis, French and Hester and other key Company and bank employees. The awards to our named executive officers consist of an aggregate of 125,000 restricted shares of our common stock subject to performance conditions and an aggregate of 250,000 performance-based stock options. The performance goal for these awards will be met as of the end of the calendar quarter when the Company has achieved average adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 per share for four consecutive quarters or $2.00 total adjusted diluted earnings per share over a period of four consecutive quarters. In determining whether the performance goal has been met, the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share will exclude one-time or non-reoccurring gains or losses. Once the performance goal has been met, the restricted shares will vest over five years in three equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the date that the performance goal is met, and the stock options will vest in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date that the performance goal is met. The purposes of these awards were to provide an additional retention and performance incentive for these executives and to further align their interests with the interests of our shareholders. The restricted shares had a fair market value on the date of grant of $23.32 per share, and the stock options had a fair market value on the date of grant of $5.56 per share based on the Black-Scholes valuation method for stock options. 
Prior to the July 2018 awards, the Committee most recently granted performance-based awards to our executive officers, other than our Chairman, in August 2015, when the Committee awarded an aggregate of 65,000 performance-based restricted shares and 350,000 performance-based stock options to Messrs. Davis, French and Hester. The performance goal for these awards consisted of average diluted earnings per share of $0.3125 per share for four consecutive quarters or $1.25 total diluted earnings per share over a period of four consecutive quarters. This performance goal was met as of December 31, 2016. As a result, the restricted shares will vest over five years in three equal annual installments beginning on December 31, 2019, and the stock options will vest in seven equal annual installments on each anniversary of the grant date, with the first installment vesting on December 31, 2016, the date the performance goal was met. Additionally, on August 24, 2015, the Committee granted the same executives an aggregate of 65,000 restricted shares subject to time (or fixed) vesting, which vest over five years in three equal annual installments, with the first installment vesting on August 24, 2018. 
In April 2016, Mr. Hester was also granted stock options representing 20,000 shares of our common stock as part of a Chairman's Award presented to him and other selected employees at the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of shareholders. The Chairman's award also included a cash award of $10,000. The Committee did not issue any additional equity awards to our named executive officers during 2016, 2017 or 2018. 
Retirement and Insurance Benefits 
Post-Termination Benefits. We do not have any employment, salary continuation, or severance agreements currently in effect for any of our executive officers. 
Chairman's Retirement Plan. In 2007, our Board of Directors, based on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee, approved a Chairman's Retirement Plan for our Chairman, John W. Allison. The Chairman's Retirement Plan provides a supplemental retirement benefit to Mr. Allison of $250,000 per year for 10 consecutive years or until Mr. Allison's death, whichever occurs later. 
The benefits under the plan became 100% vested and commenced on Mr. Allison reaching age 65 in 2011. The vested benefits are payable over 10 years or Mr. Allison's life, whichever is greater. If Mr. Allison dies during the 10 year guaranteed benefit period, his beneficiary will receive the remaining payments due during the guaranteed period. If he dies after the guaranteed benefit period, no further benefits will be paid. The annual benefit is paid in monthly installments.  Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Prior to our acquisition of Community Bank in 2003, Community Bank purchased life insurance policies on its President and Chief Executive Officer, Tracy M. French. The policies offset benefit expenses associated with a supplemental annual retirement benefit that grows on a tax-deferred basis. A portion of the benefit is determined by an indexed formula. The balance of the benefit is determined by crediting interest on the accrued balances. The calculation for the benefit expense accrual is: insurance policy income minus opportunity cost plus interest. The opportunity cost is determined by the bank and is equal to the five year average of the one year Treasury Bill rate. The bank (now Centennial Bank) retains the opportunity cost. Prior to Mr. French's retirement, any earnings in excess of the opportunity costs are accrued to a liability reserve account for his benefit. At retirement, this liability reserve account is amortized with interest and paid out over a period of 15 years. If Mr. French dies while there is a balance in his account, this balance will be paid in a lump sum to Mr. French's beneficiaries. 
The life insurance benefit for Mr. French is being provided by an endorsement split dollar life plan. Upon the death of the executive, the death benefit payable is equal to 70% of the net at-risk life insurance portion (total benefit less cash value) of the policies insuring the life of Mr. French. The bank has all ownership rights in the death benefits and surrender values of the insurance policy on Mr. French. Its obligations under the retirement benefit portion of this policy are unfunded; however, the bank has purchased life insurance policies on Mr. French that are actuarially designed to offset the annual expenses associated with the benefit portion of the policy and will, given reasonable actuarial assumptions, offset all of the cost during Mr. French's lifetime and provide a complete recovery of costs at death. 
401(k) Plan. All our full- and part-time employees over the age of 21 are eligible to participate in our 401(k) Plan immediately. We contribute a matching contribution equal to 50% of the participants' first 6% of deferred compensation contribution. In addition, we may make a discretionary contribution. No discretionary contributions were made during 2018. 
Health and Insurance Benefits. Our full-time officers and employees are provided hospitalization and major medical insurance. We pay a substantial part of the premiums for these coverages. All insurance coverage under these plans is provided under group plans on generally the same basis to all of our full-time employees. Also, we provide other basic insurance coverage including dental, life, and long-term disability insurance. 
In 2004, First State Bank (now Centennial Bank) adopted an endorsement split-dollar life insurance plan which provides for the purchase of life insurance policies insuring the life of Mr. Allison. Both the bank and Mr. Allison have an interest in each of the policies, and therefore, this is classified as an endorsement split-dollar plan. Mr. Allison's beneficiaries will be entitled to an amount equal to 50% of the net at-risk insurance portion of the total proceeds. The net at-risk portion is the total proceeds less the cash value of the policy. Mr. Allison recognizes the economic value of this death benefit each year on his individual income tax return. The beneficiaries of the policies are named by Mr. Allison and the bank will receive the remainder of the death benefit. The bank has all ownership rights in the death benefits and surrender values of the policies. The premium paid on June 4, 2004, for the policies was $4.8 million. Effective December 22, 2006, the death benefits payable under these policies split between the bank and Mr. Allison's beneficiaries. If the death benefits were paid in 2018, approximately $7.4 million would be paid to the bank and approximately $1.7 million would be paid to Mr. Allison's beneficiaries.

A copy of the Compensation Committee charter is published on the Company's website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
The Committee met five times in 2018 to discuss, among other items, the salaries, bonuses and other compensation of the senior executive officers and other key employees of the Company. 
In determining the compensation of the executive officers for 2018, the Committee, among other things, evaluated the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers in light of corporate goals and objectives and reviewed the Chairman's compensation recommendations. The Committee also set the bonuses to our named executive officers for their performance in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the information provided in the preceding Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

(1)  The equity incentive plan awards set forth in the table above will be eligible to vest upon the achievement of  a specified performance goal, after which the awards will vest according to a time-based vesting schedule, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment. The "threshold" column reflects the number of shares to vest in  the first installment following achievement of the performance goal. The "target" and "maximum" columns reflect the vesting of the entire award. More information regarding the vesting conditions for these awards is set forth in  the narrative discussion that follows.

The restricted shares granted to Mr. Allison on January 19, 2018, will vest over three years in 50% installments beginning January 19, 2020. The equity awards granted to Messrs. Sims, Davis, French and Hester on July 19, 2018, consist of restricted shares subject to performance conditions ("Performance Shares") and performance-based stock options ("Performance Options"). The Performance Shares will vest over five years in three equal annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the date that the performance goal is met, and the Performance Options will vest in five equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date that the performance goal is met. The performance goal for these awards will be met as of the end of the calendar quarter when the Company has achieved average adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 per share for four consecutive quarters or $2.00 total adjusted diluted earnings per share over a period of four consecutive quarters. In determining whether the performance goal has been met, the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share will exclude one-time or non-reoccurring gains or losses.  As of February 8, 2019, options to purchase 3,621,203 shares remain outstanding under the Plan, and 1,650,443 shares of common stock remain available for future awards under the Plan.

Pension and Other Benefits 
The following table contains information about the actuarial present value, computed as of December 31, 2018, of the accumulated benefit to each of our named executive officers under each plan in which the named executive officer participates that provides for the payment of specified retirement benefits or benefits that will be paid primarily following retirement:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The benefits under the Chairman's Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are not  dependent on credited years of service. The benefits under the Chairman's Retirement Plan became fully vested in 2011 when Mr. Allison reached age 65. Mr. French is fully vested in the balance accrued to the liability reserve account  for his benefit in connection with the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.  
[END TABLE]
The present value of Mr. Allison's accumulated benefit is calculated based on an 8.00% rate of return over 17.2 years and a $250,000 annual payment. The present value of Mr. French's accumulated benefit is calculated based on 180 monthly payments to be made once Mr. French retires, and the monthly payment amount will be determined based upon the amount that has been accrued in the corresponding reserve liability account on the bank's books. Prior to Mr. French's retirement, this liability account will be increased or decreased based upon the performance of the two life insurance policies, in addition to 8% interest credited to this account. After the liability account has been paid out in full, Mr. French will begin receiving the indexed retirement benefit payable for lifetime. See "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Components of Compensation" for more information regarding these retirement plans. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
We do not currently have in effect any defined contribution or other plan that provides for the deferral of compensation to any of our named executive officers on a basis that is not tax-qualified.  Payments Upon Termination or Change-In-Control 
We do not currently have in effect any compensatory plan or other arrangement that provides for payments or the provision of benefits to any of our named executive officers upon their termination of employment with the Company or upon a change in control of the Company or a change in the officer's responsibilities. However, our equity incentive plan awards to our named executive officers are subject to accelerated vesting of the awards upon a termination of employment in certain circumstances and upon a change in control of the Company. 
Our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Performance Incentive Plan, as amended, generally provides that, unless the Compensation Committee provides otherwise in the applicable award agreement, upon an employee's death, any unvested stock options and unvested shares of restricted stock held by the employee at the time of his or her death will vest immediately and any unvested shares of restricted stock subject to performance conditions will vest immediately to the extent the performance conditions have been met. 
The award agreements for stock options granted to our named executive officers also generally provide that any unvested stock options will vest immediately upon the executive's death or disability, except that the stock options granted in 2018 that are subject to performance conditions will vest only to the extent the performance goal has been met as of the date of the executive's death or disability. For stock options granted before 2018, the stock option agreements also provide that any unvested options will vest immediately if the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause. In addition, each of the Company's outstanding stock option agreements also provides that any unvested options will vest immediately upon a change in control of the Company or a sale or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the surviving entity. 
With respect to shares of restricted stock granted to our named executive officers, the Company's outstanding award agreements similarly provide that any unvested restricted shares will vest immediately upon the executive's termination due to death or disability, except that any restricted shares that are subject to performance conditions will only vest to the extent the performance goal has been met as of the date of death or disability. If the executive's employment is terminated for any other reason, all unvested shares will be forfeited. The award agreements also provide that any unvested shares will vest immediately upon a change in control of the Company, except that with respect to the performance-based restricted shares granted in 2018, the shares will vest only to the extent the performance goal has been met on the date of the change in control. 
The following table summarizes, on a stock split adjusted basis, the estimated value for each named executive officer of the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards upon a termination of the named executive officer's employment or upon a change in control of the Company. In accordance with SEC regulations, the table assumes that the termination or change in control occurred on December 31, 2018, and the value applied to the shares of common stock is $16.34 per share based on the closing price as reported on that date on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

 Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee and management conducted an assessment of the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices during 2018, including our compensation arrangements for both executives and non-executive employees. That assessment included a review of policies and procedures relating to the components of our compensation program, a review of incentive-based equity and cash compensation features, identification of any compensation design features that could potentially encourage excessive or imprudent risk taking, and consideration of the presence or absence of controls, oversight or other factors that mitigate potential risk. 
During the review, the Committee and management concluded that several factors and controls relating to our compensation policies and practices mitigate against the potential for risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company. These factors and controls include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's lack of involvement in activities regarded as having significant inherent risk, such as  mortgage-backed securities and proprietary trading;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• management's review of compensation arrangements of employees of the Company or our bank subsidiary having  compliance, risk, credit quality, quality assurance and finance roles;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversight of incentive compensation by the Compensation Committee, which is made up of independent directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• effective internal controls over financial reporting for the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appropriate segregation of duties; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restrictions on awards that align the interests of the employee with the interests of the shareholders.   
[END TABLE]
Based upon this assessment, we do not believe that our employee compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our "median employee" and the annual total compensation of our CEO. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our CEO) was $39,983, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $703,941. Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 17.6 to 1. 
Item 402 of Regulation S-K generally requires us to identify the "median employee" only once every three years. For the proxy statement for our Annual Meeting in 2018, we determined the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our CEO) by identifying our total employee population as of December 31, 2017, which consisted of approximately 1,786 individuals. Of these employees, approximately 1,744 individuals were full-time equivalent employees, with the remainder employed on a part-time (less than 40 hours per week) basis. 
To identify the "median employee" we conducted a full analysis of this employee population, without the use of statistical sampling. We determined our median employee using "total compensation" for the full year 2017. "Total compensation" consisted of base pay, bonuses, commissions, fringe benefits, incentives, severance and vacation payout. Using this methodology, we determined that the median employee was a full-time customer service employee. 
However, because our originally identified median employee was no longer employed by the Company at December 31, 2018, as permitted by Item 402 we selected another employee whose total compensation, as described above, is substantially similar to the original median employee's total compensation. The median employee for 2018 was a member of the Company's treasury management staff. 
With respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  PROPOSAL TWO – ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE 
APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. This vote is commonly known as a "say-on-pay" vote. At our Annual Meeting in 2018, our shareholders voted to recommend that the Company hold future "say-on-pay" votes annually until the Company is next required to hold an advisory vote on the frequency with which the Company will hold future "say-on-pay" votes, which will be in 2024. Accordingly, the Company presents the resolution set forth below for approval by the shareholders in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
At our Annual Meeting in 2018, our shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers for 2017, as disclosed in last year's proxy statement. We value the endorsement by our shareholders of our executive compensation policies. We believe that our compensation policies and procedures are competitive, are focused on pay for performance principles and are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, oversees our executive compensation program and monitors our policies to ensure they continue to emphasize programs that reward executives for results that are consistent with shareholder interests. 
We encourage you to closely review our Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular disclosure which follows it, including the footnotes and narratives which accompany each table, as they describe our compensation policies and procedures and the components and amounts comprising the compensation paid to our named executive officers. 
The following resolution gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation we pay to our named executive officers by voting to approve or not approve such compensation as described in this Proxy Statement: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Home BancShares, Inc. (the "Company") approve the compensation of the Company's executives named in the Summary Compensation Table of the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Executive Compensation tables and the related disclosure contained in the Proxy Statement." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee believe that our commitment to responsible compensation practices as described in this Proxy Statement justifies a vote by shareholders FOR the resolution approving the compensation of our executives as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
The Board of Directors Recommends that Shareholders Vote 
FOR 
the Advisory (Non-binding) Resolution Approving the Company's Executive Compensation  PROPOSAL THREE – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO 
THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE 
THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES 
Our Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, currently authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value. As of the record date, 170,096,572 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, 5,271,646 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to currently outstanding stock options, and 3,621,206 shares were reserved for future awards under our Amended and Restated 2006 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended, leaving 1,650,443 shares available for other uses. 
The Board of Directors is proposing an amendment to the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000. If the shareholders approve this proposal, the first sentence of Article THIRD in the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, will be amended to read as follows: 
The authorized capital stock (the "Capital Stock") of this Corporation shall be 300,000,000 shares of voting common stock (the "Common Stock") having a par value of $0.01 per share, and 5,500,000 shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock"). 
Purpose and Effect of the Proposed Amendment 
The Board believes that the current number of authorized shares does not provide the Company with adequate flexibility to issue stock in connection with any future acquisitions or for general corporate purposes. In particular, if the Board determines that it would be appropriate to effect a significant acquisition through the exchange of common stock, conduct a stock offering or declare a stock dividend, the current number of unissued authorized shares might not be enough to complete such transaction. Although we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions, stock offerings or dividends will occur, the Board believes that the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares will provide the Company with the flexibility to issue future stock dividends or to issue shares in connection with an acquisition or for other corporate purposes, without incurring the expense of convening a special shareholder's meeting or the delay of waiting until the next annual meeting. 
If this proposal is approved, all authorized but unissued shares of common stock will be available from time to time for any proper purpose approved by the Board, including issuances in connection with stock-based benefit plans, future stock dividends and issuances to raise capital or effect acquisitions. Neither the Company nor the Board currently has any arrangements or understandings with respect to the issuance or use of the additional shares of authorized common stock sought to be approved (other than issuances permitted or required under the Company's Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended, or awards made pursuant to that plan). If this proposal is approved, all or any of the shares may be issued without further shareholder action, unless required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. 
Existing shareholders do not have preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of common stock that the Company may issue in the future. Therefore, issuances of common stock other than issuances on a pro rata basis to all shareholders would reduce each shareholder's proportionate interest in the Company. 
An increase in the authorized number of shares of common stock could have an anti-takeover effect. If we issue additional shares in the future, such an issuance could dilute the voting power of a person seeking control of the Company, thereby making an attempt to acquire control of the Company more difficult or expensive. Neither the Board nor management is currently aware of any attempt, or contemplated attempt, to acquire control of the Company, and we are not presenting this proposal with the intent that it be used as an anti-takeover device.  Vote Required to Approve Proposal 
Approval of the amendment to the Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized shares requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, assuming a quorum is present. 
The Board of Directors Recommends that Shareholders Vote 
FOR 
the Approval of the Amendment to the Company's 
Restated Articles of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares  PROPOSAL FOUR – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, were audited by BKD, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. In 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our shareholders approved the engagement of BKD, LLP to be our independent registered accounting firm for fiscal year 2018. The Audit Committee intends to approve the re-engagement of BKD, LLP to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, subject to the ratification of the appointment by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting and our formal acceptance of an engagement letter from BKD, LLP after the Annual Meeting. 
Shareholders' ratification of the selection of BKD, LLP to be our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board is submitting the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders fail to ratify the selection of BKD, LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, at its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
Representatives of BKD, LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board of Directors Recommends that Shareholders Vote 
FOR 
the Ratification of the Appointment of BKD, LLP 
as the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the 2019 Calendar Year  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
In accordance with its written charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board in, among other things, oversight of our accounting and financial reporting processes, our compliance with legal regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors and the performance of the internal and independent auditors. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is published on the Company's website at www.homebancshares.com under the caption "Investor Relations"/"Corporate Profile"/"Governance Documents." 
Our Board of Directors has determined that all seven members of the Committee are independent based upon the independence requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ, and that our Chairman, Mr. Engelkes, and Mrs. Garrett each satisfies the criteria of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the regulations of the SEC. 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of our financial statements, for the appropriateness of our accounting principles and reporting policies and for implementing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting. Our independent auditors are responsible for auditing the financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting and for reviewing our unaudited interim financial statements. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes and procedures. Except for Mr. Engelkes and Mrs. Garrett, the members of the Audit Committee have not been engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and are not professionals in those fields. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to us and on the representations made by management that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and on the representations of management and the opinion of the independent auditors that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee held five regularly scheduled meetings and three special meetings. The Audit Committee's regular meetings were conducted in order to encourage communication among the members of the Audit Committee, management, the internal auditors, and our independent auditors, BKD, LLP. Among other things, the Audit Committee discussed with our internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee separately met with each of the internal and independent auditors, with and without management, to discuss the results of their examinations and their observations and recommendations regarding our internal controls. The Audit Committee also discussed with our independent auditors all matters required by auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, including those described in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, with management, the internal auditors, and our independent auditors. Management's discussions with the Audit Committee included a review of critical accounting policies. 
The Audit Committee obtained from the independent auditors a formal written statement describing all relationships between us and our auditors that might bear on the auditors' independence consistent with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence." The Audit Committee discussed with the auditors any relationships that may have an impact on their objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the auditors' independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid to BKD, LLP for audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee concluded that the provision of services by BKD, LLP is compatible with the maintenance of BKD's independence. 
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors, and subject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities described above and in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that our audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit fees(1)    $ 910,513      $ 794,846

 All other fees(3)      55,347        28,672   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees consisted of the annual audit and quarterly review services and consent for and review of a  registration statement filed by the Company with the SEC.  
(2)  Audit related fees consisted primarily of other audit services provided in connection with acquisitions,  reporting and compliance matters.

[END TABLE]
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditor 
The Audit Committee has the responsibility of appointing, setting compensation for and overseeing the work of the independent auditor, and has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. 
Prior to engagement of the independent auditor for next year's audit, management will submit an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation of our consolidated financial  statements, as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services, and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting  standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Audit-related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by  the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  Tax services include all services performed by the independent auditor's tax personnel  except those services specifically related to the audit of the consolidated financial statements, and includes fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Other fees are those associated with services not captured in the other categories. Other than  the services for the third-party administration of the Company's defined contribution plan, we generally do not request such services from the independent auditor.  
[END TABLE]
Prior to the engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent auditor. 
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The members to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, the pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.  SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
In order for a proposal by a shareholder to be included in the Company's proxy statement and proxy form for an annual meeting of the Company's shareholders, the proposal must: (1) concern a matter that may be properly considered and acted upon at the annual meeting in accordance with applicable laws, including our Bylaws and Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) be received by the Company at its home office, 719 Harkrider Street, Suite 100, Conway, Arkansas 72032, Attention: Holly A. McKenna, Secretary, not less than 120 calendar days before the anniversary of the date of the previous year's proxy statement, or November 6, 2019, in the case of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2020. If no annual meeting was held the previous year and in any year in which the date of the annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year's annual meeting, the proposal will be considered timely if received within a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy materials. 
In connection with our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2020, if we do not receive notice of a matter or proposal to be considered by January 20, 2020, then the persons appointed by our Board to act as proxy holders for such Annual Meeting (named in the form of proxy) will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority with respect to any such matter or proposal properly presented for a vote at such meeting.
