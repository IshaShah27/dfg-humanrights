IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
Why is the Company soliciting my proxy?
The Board of Directors of Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. (the "Board") is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Company's headquarters located at 73 High Street, Buffalo, New York 14203, on April 26, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting, which we refer to as the Annual Meeting. The proxy statement along with the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders summarizes the purposes of the meeting and the information you need to know to vote at the Annual Meeting.
We have made available to you this proxy statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proxy card, the Notice, and a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 because you owned shares of Cleveland BioLabs, Inc. common stock on March 5, 2019, the record date. The Company intends to commence distribution of the proxy materials to stockholders on or about March 15, 2019.
Who can vote?
Only stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on March 5, 2019 (the "record date") are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, there were 11,298,239 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Our common stock is our only class of voting stock.
You do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares. Shares represented by valid proxies, received in time for the Annual Meeting and not revoked prior to the Annual Meeting, will be voted at the Annual Meeting. For instructions on how to change or revoke your proxy, see "May I change or revoke my proxy?" below.
Who can attend the Annual Meeting?
All stockholders as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting. Seating will be limited.
What do I need to present for admission to the Annual Meeting?
You will need to present proof of your record or beneficial ownership of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Annual Meeting.
No large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted at the Annual Meeting and recording or taking photographs or other still images during the meeting will be prohibited.
How many votes do I have?
Each share of our common stock that you own entitles you to one vote.
How do I vote?
Whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting or not, we urge you to vote by proxy. All shares represented by valid proxies that we receive through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted in accordance with your instructions on the proxy card or as instructed via Internet. You may specify whether your shares should be voted for all, or withheld from all, or some, of the nominees for director and whether your shares should be voted for, against or abstained with respect to proposal 2. If you properly submit a proxy without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations as noted below. Voting by proxy will not affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting. If your shares are registered directly in your name through our stock transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, or you have stock certificates registered in your name, you may vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet. Follow the instructions included in the Notice or the proxy card included with a paper copy of the proxy statement to vote by Internet. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail (if you received a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail). Please sign, date, and promptly mail the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope that has been provided to you. 
• In person at the meeting. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may deliver a completed proxy card in person or you may vote by completing a ballot, which will be available at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59
[BEGIN TABLE]
p.m. Eastern Time on April 25, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" (held in the name of a bank, broker, or other holder of record), you will receive instructions from the holder of record. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Internet voting also may be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it to the Annual Meeting in order to vote.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered, with respect to those shares, a "stockholder of record" and the Notice has been sent directly to you by us.
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name" and the Notice has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other holder of record who is considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the Notice or the voting instruction card included with a paper copy of the proxy statement or by following their instructions for voting on the Internet.
Have other candidates been nominated for election as directors at the Annual Meeting?
   No.
How does the Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
The Board recommends that you vote as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the nominees for director; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the selection of Meaden & Moore, Ltd. as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and 
[END TABLE]
If any other matter is presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy provides that your shares will be voted by the proxy holder listed in the proxy in accordance with his best judgment. At the time this proxy statement was first made available, we knew of no matters that needed to be acted on at the Annual Meeting, other than those discussed in this proxy statement.
May I change or revoke my proxy?
If you give us your proxy, you may change or revoke it at any time before the Annual Meeting. You may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it as instructed above; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by re-voting by Internet as instructed above; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by notifying the Secretary of the Company in writing before the Annual Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by attending the Annual Meeting in person and voting in person. Attending the Annual Meeting in person will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically request at the Annual Meeting that it be revoked. 
[END TABLE]
Your most current vote whether by Internet or proxy card is the one that will be counted.
What if I receive more than one proxy card?
You may receive more than one proxy card if you hold shares of our common stock in more than one account, which may be in registered form or held in street name. Please vote in the manner described above under "How do I vote?" for each account to ensure that all of your shares are voted. Table of Contents
Will my shares be voted if I do not vote?
If your shares are registered in your name or if you have stock certificates, they will not be counted if you do not vote as  described above under "How do I vote?" If your shares are held in street name and you do not provide voting instructions to the bank, broker, or other nominee that holds your shares as described above, the bank, broker, or other nominee that holds your shares has the authority to vote your non-voted shares only on the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2 of this proxy statement) without receiving instructions from you. Therefore, we encourage you to provide voting   instructions to your bank, broker, or other nominee. This ensures your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting and in the manner  you desire.
A "broker non-vote" will occur if your broker cannot vote your shares on a particular matter because it has not received instructions from you and does not have discretionary voting authority on that matter or because your broker chooses not to vote on a matter for which it does have discretionary voting authority.
What vote is required to approve each proposal and how are votes counted?
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal 1: Elect Directors  The nominees for director who receive the most "FOR" votes (also known as a "plurality" of the votes cast) will be elected. You may vote either FOR all of the nominees, WITHHOLD your vote from all of the nominees or WITHHOLD your vote from any one or more of the nominees. Votes that are withheld will have no effect on the election of the directors. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' non-voted shares held by the firms in street name for the election of the directors. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote.

Proposal 2: Ratify Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast for this proposal is required to ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of this vote. Brokerage firms have authority to vote customers' non-voted shares held by the firms in street name on this proposal. If a broker does not exercise this authority, such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. We are not required to obtain the approval of our stockholders to select  our independent registered public accounting firm. However, if our stockholders do not ratify the selection of Meaden & Moore, Ltd. as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, our Audit Committee of our Board will reconsider its selection.

[END TABLE]
Could stockholders introduce other proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?
As of the date of this proxy statement, we did not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement. If any other items or matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxies received will be voted on those items or matters in accordance with the discretion of the proxy holders.
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?
As of the date of this proxy statement, we did not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement, including those described in the foregoing paragraph. If any other items or matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxies received will be voted on those items or matters in accordance with the discretion of the proxy holders.
What are the costs of soliciting these proxies? 
We will pay all of the costs of soliciting these proxies. Our directors, officers, and employees may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, fax, or email. We will pay these employees, officers, and directors no additional compensation for these services. We will ask banks, brokers, and other institutions, nominees, and fiduciaries to forward these proxy materials to their customers and to obtain authority to execute proxies. We will then reimburse them for their expenses. 
What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Votes of stockholders of record who are present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, abstentions, and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Table of Contents
Who are the persons selected by the Board to serve as proxies?
Yakov Kogan and Christopher Zosh, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card and voting instruction card accompanying the paper copy of this proxy statement, were selected by the Board to serve in such capacity. Yakov Kogan is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Christopher Zosh is the VP of Finance of the Company.
Who will count the vote?
At the Annual Meeting, the results of stockholder voting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed by us for the meeting.
Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
No. Holders of the Company's common stock will not be entitled to exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights under Delaware law with respect to any matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting.
Is there a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
Yes. A list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, will be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the Annual Meeting, during ordinary business hours, commencing April 15, 2019, and continuing through the date of the Annual Meeting, at our principal offices located at 73 High Street, Buffalo, New York 14203.
Can I access the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Proxy Statement, and Annual Report to Stockholders on the Internet?
Our Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, containing financial and other information pertaining to us, is being furnished to stockholders with this proxy statement. The notice of annual meeting of stockholders, proxy statement, proxy card, and Annual Report to Stockholders are available on the Internet at http://www.cstproxy.com/cbiolabs/2019 and are also available on our website at www.cbiolabs.com under the link "Investors." Table of Contents
Attending the Annual Meeting
The Annual Meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 26, 2019 at the Company's headquarters located at 73 High Street, Buffalo, New York 14203. When you arrive at the Company's headquarters, signs will direct you to the appropriate meeting rooms. You need not attend the Annual Meeting in order to vote.
Householding of annual disclosure documents
SEC rules concerning the delivery of annual disclosure documents allow us or your broker to send a single set of our proxy materials to any household at which two or more of our stockholders reside, if we or your broker believe that the stockholders are members of the same family. This practice, referred to as "householding," benefits both you and us. It reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses. The rule applies to our annual reports, proxy statements, information statements, and Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Once you receive notice from your broker or from us that communications to your address will be "householded," the practice will continue until you are otherwise notified or until you revoke your consent to the practice. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions.
If your household received a single set of proxy materials this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, please contact our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, by calling their toll free number, 1-866-894-0537, and we will promptly deliver a separate copy to you.
If you do not wish to participate in "householding" and would like to receive your own set of proxy materials in future years, follow the instructions described below. Conversely, if you share an address with another stockholder of CBLI and together both of you would like to receive only a single set of proxy materials, follow these instructions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares are registered in your own name, please contact our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, and inform them of your request by calling them at 1-866-894-0537 or writing them at 17 Battery Place, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attn: Proxy Department. 
• If a broker or other nominee holds your shares, please contact the broker or other nominee directly and inform them of your request. Be sure to include your name, the name of your brokerage firm, and your account number. 
[END TABLE]
Electronic Delivery of Company Stockholder Communications
Most stockholders can elect to view or receive copies of future proxy materials over the Internet instead of receiving paper copies in the mail.
You can choose this option and save the Company the cost of producing and mailing these documents by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• following the instructions provided when you vote over the Internet; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• going to http://www.cstproxy.com/cbiolabs/2019 and following the instructions provided.

 Table of Contents
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February 28, 2019 for (a) the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the section titled "Executive Officer and Director Compensation," (b) each of our directors and director nominees, (c) all of our current directors and executive officers as a group and (d) stockholders that beneficially owned more than 5% of our common stock. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities. We deem shares of common stock that may be acquired by a person or group within 60 days of February 28, 2019 pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants to be outstanding and beneficially owned by such person or group for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such individual or group, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person shown in the table. Except as indicated in footnotes to this table, we believe that the stockholders named in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown to be beneficially owned by them based on information provided to us by these stockholders. Percentage of ownership is based on 11,298,239 shares of common stock outstanding on February 28, 2019.

Change of Control of the Company
On July 9, 2015, we closed a private placement transaction with David Davidovich, a venture capital investor, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to Mr. Davidovich an aggregate of 6,459,948 shares of the Company's common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25 million, or $3.87 per share, under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and Mr. Davidovich, dated June 24, 2015 (the "Davidovich Purchase Agreement"). Under the Davidovich Purchase  Table of Contents
Agreement, Mr. Davidovich also has the right to nominate for election to the Board a majority of directors until such time when he no longer holds a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company. As a result of the closing of the issuance and sale of the shares to Mr. Davidovich under the terms of the Davidovich Purchase Agreement, Mr. Davidovich assumed effective control of the Company through his ownership of approximately 60% (since reduced to 57.18% due to the subsequent issuance of additional shares of common stock) of our outstanding shares of common stock and his right to nominate for election to the Board a majority of our directors.
In connection with the closing of Mr. Davidovich's purchase, on July 9, 2015, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Mr. Davidovich (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 registering for resale the shares held by Mr. Davidovich. The registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and since July 9, 2017 Mr. Davidovich has been able to freely sell some or all of his shares of our common stock, the effect of which sale or sales may be that Mr. Davidovich ceases to control the Company.

Committees of the Board of Directors and Meetings; Independence
The Board has established an Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of directors who are "independent" as that concept is defined in the corporate governance listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules. The Audit Committee has a written charter that is posted on our website, www.cbiolabs.com, under the link "Investors" and the section therein entitled "Corporate Governance."
Because David Davidovich holds more than 50% of the voting power for the election of our directors, the Company is a "controlled company" within the meaning of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules, and therefore exempt from a number of corporate governance rules applicable to non-controlled companies. Although we are not required to have a majority of independent directors as a result of our status as a "controlled company," our Board has affirmatively determined that all of our directors are "independent." Mme. Verny and each of Messrs. Saluck and Andryuschechkin are independent under The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") for purposes of serving on the Audit Committee.  Each of Mme. Evdokimova and Messrs. Persiyanov, Talyanskiy, and Fedyunin are independent under such rules for purposes of board service.
Meeting Attendance. The Board has adopted a policy specifying that it is the responsibility of each director to attend all meetings of the Board and all meetings of the committees of the Board on which he or she serves.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were five meetings of our Board. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board or fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of committees of the Board on which he or she served during fiscal year 2018.
The Company does not have a policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders, however, all directors are encouraged to attend. None of our directors, attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
It is also the policy of the Board to hold executive sessions of non-employee directors at each regularly scheduled Board meeting and, if any of the non-employee directors are not independent, to hold executive sessions of the independent directors at least twice  per year. Each of the non-employee directors in fiscal year 2018 was determined by the Board to be independent.
Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee met four times during fiscal year 2018. This committee currently has three members, Messrs. Saluck (Chair) and Andryuschechkin and Ms. Verny.
The Board has determined that Mr. Saluck is an "audit committee financial expert," as the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined that term in Item 407 of Regulation S-K. Please also see the report of the Audit Committee set forth elsewhere in this proxy statement.
The Audit Committee generally has direct responsibility and oversight for our accounting policies and internal controls, financial reporting practices, and legal and regulatory compliance. More specifically, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing the annual audited financial statements and disclosures with management and our independent auditor; reviewing the financial statements and disclosures provided in our quarterly and periodic reports with management and the independent auditor; and overseeing the external audit coverage, including appointment and replacement of the independent auditor and pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditor. Table of Contents
Compensation Setting Process. As a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ Stock Market rules, we are not required to, and do not now maintain a compensation committee. Instead, our entire Board is responsible for compensation matters. We believe that this is appropriate because of our "controlled company" status, as a single investor, David Davidovich, holds over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and through his effective voting control of the company and through his ability to designate a majority of the directors nominated to serve on our Board, effectively controls the Board.
The full Board determines and approves the compensation level of executive officers based on an evaluation of their performance in light of our goals and objectives. The Board also considers our performance and relative stockholder return, the level and value of similar incentive awards prevalent in the industry, and awards given to executive officers in past years. From time to time, the Board requests suggestions or recommendations from the CEO regarding executive compensation, whether at meetings of the Board or in discussions with individual directors. The Board also discusses with the CEO his own compensation package, but the Board ultimately makes decisions regarding his compensation independently. The CEO's recommendations are considered and reviewed by the Board when determining the compensation of other executive officers. The Board also has the authority to determine compensation for directors and the form of this compensation. The Board may take action with respect to the adoption, amendment, termination, or replacement of both incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. The Board has the power to retain professionals to assist in the evaluation of director and executive compensation, and has the sole authority to retain and terminate any such professional and to approve their fees. The Board did not engage any compensation consultants to determine or recommend the amount or form of any executive or director compensation during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Board may also delegate authority to any committee or subcommittee of directors to evaluate special or unique matters.
Nominating Process. As a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ Stock Market rules, we are not required to, and do not now maintain a nominating and governance committee. Instead, our entire Board is responsible for recommending director candidates for election. We believe that this is appropriate because of our "controlled company" status, as a single investor, David Davidovich, holds over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and through his effective voting control of the Company and through his ability to designate a majority of the directors nominated serve on our Board, effectively controls the election of our directors. 
Accordingly, the full Board generally has responsibility for identifying candidates who are eligible under the qualification standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and recommending such eligible individuals to serve as members of the Board. In addition, under our current corporate governance policies, the Board may consider candidates recommended by stockholders as well as from other sources such as other directors or officers, third party search firms or other appropriate sources. For all potential candidates, the Board may consider all factors it deems relevant, such as a candidate's personal integrity and sound judgment, business and professional skills and experience, independence, knowledge of the industry in which we operate, possible conflicts of interest, diversity, the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board, and concern for the long-term interests of the stockholders. In general, persons recommended by stockholders will be considered on the same basis as candidates from other sources.
If a stockholder wishes to nominate a candidate for director who is not to be included in our proxy statement, it must follow the following procedures, in addition to those described in our Second Amended and Restated By-Laws, and "Proposals of Stockholders" at the end of this proxy statement. The Board considers many factors when considering candidates for the Board and strives for the Board to be comprised of directors with a variety of experiences and backgrounds, who have high-level managerial experience in a complex organization, and who represent the balanced interest of stockholders as a whole rather than those of special interest groups. Other important factors in Board composition include strength of character, mature judgment, specialized expertise, relevant scientific and technical skills, diversity, level of education, broad-based business acumen, experience and understanding of strategy and policy-setting and the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board. Depending upon the current needs of the Board, we may weigh certain factors more or less heavily than others. The Board believes that it is essential that our Board members represent diverse viewpoints, with a broad array of experiences, skills and backgrounds that, when considered as a group, provide a sufficient mix of perspectives to allow the Board to best fulfill its responsibilities to the long-term interests of our stockholders.
In considering candidates for the Board, the Board considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials and does not have any specific minimum qualifications that must be met by a Board or stockholder-recommended nominee. However, the Board does believe that all members of the Board should have the highest character and integrity, a reputation for working constructively with others, sufficient time to devote to Board matters, and no conflict of interest that would interfere with their performance as a director. In the case of current directors being considered for renomination, the Board will also take into account the director's history of attendance at meetings of the Board or its committees, the director's tenure as a member of the Board, and the director's preparation for and participation in such meetings. Table of Contents
The Board considers director candidates from any reasonable source, including stockholder recommendations. The Board does not evaluate candidates differently based on who has made the recommendation. The Board has the authority to hire consultants or search firms to assist in the process of identifying and evaluating candidates. Candidates are recommended to the Board after consultation with the Chairman of the Board.
Stockholders who wish to suggest qualified candidates should write to the Office of the Secretary, Cleveland BioLabs, Inc., 73 High Street, Buffalo, New York 14203 specifying the name of the candidates and stating in detail the qualifications of such persons for consideration by the Board. A written statement from the candidate consenting to be named as a candidate and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director, should accompany any such recommendation. Stockholders who wish to nominate a director for election at an annual meeting of stockholders must comply with our Second Amended and Restated By-Laws regarding stockholder proposals and nominations. See "Proposals of Stockholders" contained herein.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which it reviews from time to time, to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to exercise its business judgment in what it believes to be the best interests of our stockholders. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are posted on our website, www.cbiolabs.com, under the link "Investors" and the section therein titled "Corporate  Governance."
Code of Ethics for Senior Executives and Financial Officers, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors and Code of Conduct
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Executives and Financial Officers that is specifically applicable to executive officers and senior financial officers, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Additionally, the Board has adopted the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors that is specifically applicable to our directors. Both the Code of Ethics for Senior Executives and Financial Officers and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are posted on our website, www.cbiolabs.com, under the link "Investors" and the section therein titled "Corporate Governance." We have also adopted a Code of Conduct in order to promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with the laws and governmental rules and regulations to which we are subject. The Code of Conduct is applicable to all of our employees, officers and directors, and is posted on our website, www.cbiolabs.com, under the link "Investors" and the section therein titled "Corporate Governance."
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines describe our policies concerning, among other things, the role of the Board and management, proper Board functions, independence, and committee matters. The positions of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are currently held by different persons, although we do not have a policy requiring that to be the case. Instead, our Board has the authority to choose its Chair in any way it deems best for us at any given point in time. Accordingly, our Board reserves the right to vest the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer and Chair in the same person or in two different individuals depending on what it believes is in our best interest. At this time, our Board has determined that separation of these roles most appropriately suits us. Our current Chair, Ms. Verny, is qualified to serve as our Chair given her expertise with emerging companies. Further, our Board believes that this division of roles allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus more of his efforts on achieving the goals and objectives of our strategic plan. Our Board believes that there is no  single leadership structure that would be most effective in all circumstances and, therefore, retains the authority to modify our Board's structure to best address our circumstances as and when appropriate.
Role of Our Board in Risk Oversight
The Board, as a whole and at the committee level, has overall responsibility for overseeing our risks, including general oversight of our executive officers' management of risks relevant to the Company. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the material risks a company faces and the steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of our Board in reviewing our strategic plan is an integral aspect of the Board's assessment of management's tolerance for risk and also its determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company.  We believe that having the positions of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer held by different persons currently enhances the Board's ability to effectively manage risk.
The Board also oversees the management of risks relating to our executive compensation and manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest. The Audit Committee oversees our risk policies and processes related to the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices, including our audited and unaudited financial statements and internal controls. The Audit Committee is also responsible for addressing risks arising from related party transactions. Table of Contents

Our executive officers are eligible to participate in the same group insurance and employee benefit plans as our other salaried employees.  These benefits include medical, dental, vision, and disability benefits and life insurance.
We have adopted a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan, our 401(k) Plan, for eligible U.S. employees, including our named executive officers. Eligible employees may elect to defer a percentage of their eligible compensation in the 401(k) Plan, subject to the statutorily prescribed annual limit.

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board maintains an Audit Committee comprised of three non-employee members of the Board. After reviewing the qualifications of the current members of the committee, and any relationships they may have with the Company that might affect their independence from the Company, the Board has determined that (1) all current members of the Audit Committee are "independent"  as that concept is defined in Section 10A of the Exchange Act, (2) all current members of the Audit Committee are "independent" as that concept is defined in The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules, (3) all current members of the Audit Committee are financially literate, and (4) Mr. Saluck qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under the applicable rules promulgated pursuant to the Exchange Act.
The Audit Committee's role and responsibilities are set forth in its charter adopted by the Board, which is available on our website at www.cbiolabs.com. The Audit Committee reviews and reassesses its charter annually and recommends any changes to the Board for approval. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our overall financial reporting process, and for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of our independent, registered public accounting firm. The members of the Audit Committee are not professional auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management or the independent auditors, nor can the Audit Committee certify that the independent auditors are "independent" under applicable rules.  The Audit Committee serves in a board-level oversight role in which it provides advice, counsel, and direction to management and the auditors based on the information it receives, on discussions with management and the auditors, and on the members of the Audit Committee's experience in business, financial, and accounting matters. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage its own outside advisors, apart from counsel or advisors hired by management, as it determines appropriate, including experts in particular areas of accounting. Management is responsible for the reporting processes and preparation and presentation of financial statements and the implementation and maintenance of internal controls. The Company's independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's consolidated financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles in the  United States.
In fulfilling its responsibilities for the financial statements for fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee took the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed each of the unaudited quarterly financial statements and the audited financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year with management and Meaden & Moore, Ltd., our independent registered public accounting firm; 
• Discussed with Meaden & Moore, Ltd. the matters required to be discussed in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU Section 380) as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T; and 
• Received written disclosures and the letter from Meaden & Moore, Ltd. required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Meaden & Moore, Ltd.'s communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence and discussed with Meaden & Moore, Ltd. the firm's independence. The Audit Committee also considered the status of pending litigation, taxation matters and other areas of oversight relating to the financial reporting and audit process that the committee determined appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements and discussions with management and Meaden & Moore, Ltd., the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Our records reflect that all reports which were required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to ownership of our securities were filed on a timely basis. In making these statements, we have relied upon the written representations of our directors and executive officers and copies of their reports that have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Table of Contents
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Pursuant to our written Related Party Transaction Policy, the Audit Committee must provide written approval in advance for any transaction that could involve an actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest, including transactions where employees or directors have a substantial financial interest in any of our competitors, customers or suppliers, or where gifts or loans of value in excess of $200 are received in a year from our suppliers, customers or competitors. The policy also requires advance written approval for any transaction where an employee or director owns a substantial interest in an entity that has a prospective business relationship with,  or is a competitor of, us.  In determining whether to approve any transaction requiring review under the policy, the Audit Committee considers whether the terms of the transaction are fair and on the same basis as would apply for a non-related party; whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the transaction; whether the transaction would impair the independence of an independent director; and whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for a director or executive of the Company. The following is a list of transactions with related persons reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. There were no transactions with related persons required to be reported that were not reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee that were entered into during the year ended December  31, 2018, except that the transactions involving Norma Investments Limited described below were approved by the full Board, with no participation by the interested directors.
Transactions and Relationships with Dr. Gudkov
Our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Andrei Gudkov, is the Senior Vice President of Basic Science and the Chairman of the Department of Cell Stress Biology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute ("RPCI"). We subcontract Dr. Gudkov's laboratory at RPCI from Health Research Inc. to perform certain research and development studies for us, and also purchase certain core products and services from RPCI, including mice, the housing and storage of mice, irradiator services, DNA sequencing and blood analysis. RPCI also serves as one of our clinical sites. For the aforementioned services, we paid Health Research Inc. approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, we transferred 23 research scientists to Buffalo BioLabs, Inc. ("BBL") in the later part of 2013, an entity then partially-owned by Dr. Gudkov and of which he is a founder and the Principal Scientific Advisor. We hire BBL on a project basis to perform research work, as needed. For the aforementioned services, we paid BBL approximately $0.5 million and $0.2 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Dr. Gudkov is also an uncompensated member of the board of directors for Incuron, LLC ("Incuron").  Pursuant to master service and development agreements we have with Incuron, the Company performs various research, business development, clinical advisory, and management services for Incuron.

In addition, we also recognized $5,178 and $7,104 from Incuron for sublease and other income for the years ended for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Transactions and Relationships with GPI and Norma Investments
As previously disclosed, in the third quarter of 2018, the Company entered into a series of related transactions under which the Company and Everon Biosciences, Inc. ("Everon") licensed and assigned certain intellectual property to Genome Protection, Inc. ("GPI"), a corporation formed by the Company for the purpose of creating a joint venture with Everon. GPI, which is currently 50% owned by the Company and 50% owned by Everon, is undertaking a research and development program aimed at clinical testing of entolimod and GP532 (a variant of our entolimod drug candidate) and the development of medications with anti-aging and other indications associated with genome damage. On August 10, 2018, GPI, Norma Investments Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ("Norma"), the Company and Everon entered into that certain Simple Agreement for Future Equity (the "SAFE"). Norma is controlled by investor Roman Abramovich, who also controls Millhouse Capital, LLC, the employer of three members of the Company's Board, Anna Evdokimova, Ivan Fedyunin and Ivan Persiyanov, and of which the Company's majority stockholder is chief executive officer. Ms. Evdokimova and Messrs. Fedyunin and Persiyanov did not participate in the deliberations or vote to approve the Company's entry into the SAFE.
Under the SAFE, GPI granted Norma the right to purchase shares of GPI's capital stock in exchange for the payment of up to $30,000,000, of which $10,500,000 was paid shortly after the execution of the SAFE and the remainder may be paid, if at all, in tranches over time.  The SAFE also provides that, upon the closing of a transaction in which GPI raises $3,000,000 or more in equity capital from a third party, Norma has the right to require GPI to issue to it the number of shares obtained by dividing the purchase price paid for the SAFE through such date by 50% of the price per share of the equity securities sold to the third party. If GPI experiences a change of control event or completes a firm commitment initial public offering of securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, then GPI will, at Norma's option, either (i) pay to Norma an amount equal to the purchase price paid by Norma through such date under the SAFE plus interest accrued at a rate of 6.33% per year or (ii) issue to Norma shares of its common stock in the number obtained by dividing the purchase price paid by Norma through such date under the SAFE by 50% of the price per share of GPI's common stock based on GPI's valuation immediately preceding the consummation of either the change-of-control event or initial public offering. If GPI is dissolved, terminates its operations, makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors or liquidates or winds up its affairs, then GPI must pay Norma an amount equal to the purchase price paid by Norma through such date under the SAFE, prior to any distributions are made to any holders of GPI's capital stock, including the Company. The term of the SAFE is perpetual, terminating only upon the full repayment or conversion of the purchase price paid by Norma to GPI in connection with the events described above.
Under the SAFE, the parties agree that GPI's board of directors (the "GPI Board") will consist of four members, two of whom will be selected by Norma, one of whom will be selected by the Company and one of whom will be selected by Everon. The SAFE also provides that the parties agreed that a quorum of the GPI Board will require that at least one of the directors selected by Norma be present. Additionally, the SAFE sets forth a number of actions that GPI will be prohibited from taking without the unanimous consent of all of the members of the GPI Board, including, among other things, effecting a change of control transaction, terminating its operations, dissolving or liquidating, amending its organizational documents, transferring or licensing its intellectual property or issuing any shares of capital stock. The SAFE sets forth other matters that must be approved by a majority of the members of the GPI Board, including the incurrence of indebtedness exceeding $100,000, granting a lien or other encumbrance on GPI's assets, entering into a related party transaction and hiring, terminating or setting the compensation of executive officers. The Company and Everon have each guaranteed, to the extent of their powers as stockholders of GPI, the due and punctual performance by GPI of all of its obligations under the SAFE, and have also agreed to indemnify, on a joint and several basis, Norma for any losses arising out of any misrepresentation or any material breach of the SAFE, up to the amount of the purchase price paid by Norma under the SAFE.
In connection with the execution of the SAFE, the Company, Everon, GPI and Norma entered into that certain Director Designation Agreement, dated as of August 10, 2018 (the "Director Designation Agreement"), pursuant to which the parties made certain commitments as to voting and transfer of their shares of GPI and GPI's governance. Under the terms of the Director Designation Agreement, the parties agreed that the GPI Board will consist of four members, two of whom will be selected by Norma, one of whom will be selected by the Company and one of whom will be selected by Everon. Each party to the Director Designation Agreement also commits to (i) vote its GPI capital stock for the selected designees of the other parties, (ii) cause the director(s) appointed by it to nominate for election the selected designees of the other parties, (iii) vote its GPI capital stock for the removal of a member of the GPI Board if the party that originally selected such person so requests and (iv) to cause the director(s) appointed by it to vote to fill any vacancy created by the death, resignation or removal of a party's designee director with the replacement designee selected by such party.
Similar to the SAFE, the Director Designation Agreement sets forth a number of actions that GPI will be prohibited from taking without the unanimous consent of all of the members of the GPI Board, including, among other things, effecting a change of control transaction, terminating its operations, dissolving or liquidating, amending its organizational documents, transferring or licensing its intellectual property or issuing any shares of capital stock. The Director Designation Agreement sets forth other matters that must be approved by a majority of the members of the GPI Board, including the incurrence of indebtedness exceeding $100,000, granting a lien or other encumbrance on GPI's assets, entering into a related party transaction and hiring, terminating or setting the compensation of executive officers.
The Director Designation Agreement also contains a right of first refusal in favor of Norma under which if either the Company or Everon desires to sell its shares in GPI to a third party, it must first give notice to Norma, which then has the right to purchase some or all of such shares on the same terms and conditions as the selling stockholder had proposed to sell the shares to a third party. If Norma does not elect to purchase all of the shares that either the Company or Everon proposed to sell, then the Company or Everon, respectively, may sell such shares to the third party.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
(Notice Item 1)
Our Board of Directors currently consists of seven directors. Alexander Andryuschechkin, Anna Evdokimova, Ivan Fedyunin, Ivan Persiyanov, Randy S. Saluck, Daniil Talyanskiy, and Lea Verny are currently on our board and are nominees in the current election. 
If elected, the seven nominees for election as directors at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will serve for one-year terms expiring at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board recommends that the stockholders vote in favor of the election of the nominees named in this proxy statement to serve as our directors. See "Management and Corporate Governance—The Board of Directors" above. Proxies solicited by the Company for the election of directors cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in the proxy.
In accordance with NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(b)(1), and the standard of independence defined in NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5605(a)(2), "independent directors" will comprise our entire Board of Directors. Additionally, Randy S. Saluck, Alexander Andryuschechkin, and Lea Verny are independent for purposes of serving on the Audit Committee.
Unless authority to vote for any of these nominees is withheld, the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted "FOR" the election as directors of Alexander Andryuschechkin, Anna Evdokimova, Ivan Fedyunin, Ivan Persiyanov, Randy S. Saluck, Daniil Talyanskiy, and Lea Verny. In the event that any nominee becomes unable or unwilling to serve, the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted for the election of such other person as the Board of Directors may recommend in that nominee's place. We have no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director.
A plurality of the shares voted "FOR" each nominee at the meeting is required to elect each nominee as a director.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THE ELECTION OF MR. ANDRYUSCHECHKIN, MS. EVDOKIMOVA, MR. FEDYUNIN, MR. PERSIYANOV, MR. SALUCK, MR. TALYANSKIY, AND MS. VERNY, AS DIRECTORS, AND PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF SUCH APPROVAL UNLESS A STOCKHOLDER INDICATES OTHERWISE ON THE PROXY. Table of Contents
