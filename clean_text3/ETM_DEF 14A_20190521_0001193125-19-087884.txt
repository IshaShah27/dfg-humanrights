Field or David J. Field, in their own right or pursuant to a proxy, is entitled to one vote; (ii) the holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a single class, are entitled to elect two Class A Directors; (iii) each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to one vote with respect to certain "Going Private Transactions" (as defined in the Charter); and (iv) as required by law. Therefore: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholders of our Class A Common Stock at the close of business on March 22, 2019 will be entitled to  vote on Proposals 1 through 3.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholders of our Class B Common Stock at the close of business on March 22, 2019 will only be entitled to  vote on Proposals 2 through 3.  
[END TABLE]
At the close of business on March 22, 2019, there were 138,574,066 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, which include 4,464,472 shares that are either unvested restricted stock or vested but deferred shares of restricted stock (neither of which has the right to vote). As a result, as of the close of business on March 22, 2019, there were 134,109,594 shares of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. In addition, at the close of business on March 22, 2019, there were 4,045,199 outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock and no outstanding shares of our Class C Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock voted by Joseph M. Field or David J. Field with respect to any proposal other than Proposal 1 (with respect to which Class B shares cannot vote) is entitled to ten votes. Holders of our Class C Common Stock, of which there are none, would not be entitled to vote on these proposals. 
INFORMATION ABOUT QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTES 
The presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter or proposal to be acted upon at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of consideration and action on the matter or proposal. Assuming a quorum is present, votes on the proposals will be tallied as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1: Election of a Class A Director in Board Class II. The person nominated as a  Class A Director in Board Class II receiving the most votes from shares of Class A Common Stock will be elected.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2: Election of two other Directors in Board Class II. The two persons nominated as  Directors in Board Class II (other than a person nominated as a Class A Director in Board Class II) receiving the most votes from all shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will be elected.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3: Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The  ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, requires the affirmative vote from a majority of the votes of all shares of Class A  Common Stock and Class B Common Stock that are present in person or by proxy and are voting on such proposal.  
[END TABLE]
In the event a quorum is not present at the meeting and such meeting is adjourned to a later date at least fifteen days after the initial date of the meeting, then those shareholders who attend the adjourned meeting shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon the matters to be considered. 
Unless otherwise required by our Bylaws or by applicable law, approval of any other matter properly presented for a vote at the meeting will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock present in person or by proxy; provided that if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, such approval will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class who are present in person or by proxy. 
Shares of our common stock represented by proxies that are marked "withhold authority" or are marked "abstain," or which constitute broker non-votes will be counted as present at the meeting for the purpose of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes occur when a nominee holding shares of our common stock for a beneficial owner has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and such nominee does not possess, or chooses to not exercise, discretionary authority with respect thereto. 
Generally, with respect to any matter to be decided by a plurality (such as the election of Directors) or a majority of the votes cast at the meeting, proxies marked "withhold authority" or marked "abstain," or which constitute broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast at the meeting and will have no effect on the outcome of such vote.

We have not authorized anyone to give any information or to make any representations in connection with this proxy solicitation other than those contained in this proxy statement.

PROPOSAL 3 
RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSAL 
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and is proposing that the shareholders ratify such selection. Although ratification is not required by law, the Audit Committee believes that our shareholders should be given an opportunity to express their views on the subject. SEC Rule 10A-3(b)2 requires that the audit committee "must be directly responsible for the appointment . . . of any registered public accounting firm." Since the Audit Committee cannot abdicate this authority to the shareholders, the ratification of the selection is not binding. Any failure of the shareholders to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm would, however, be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to continue the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
INFORMATION CONCERNING INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since June 2002. Our Audit Committee has appointed PwC to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. It is anticipated that a representative of PwC will attend the annual meeting. Such representative will have an opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions of shareholders. 
Principal Accounting Firm Fees and Expenses. The following table sets forth the aggregate fees and expenses billed to us by PwC, our principal accounting firm, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

(2)  Audit-related fees for professional services rendered in 2017 included: (i) due diligence services  provided in connection with the CBS Radio acquisition and debt refinancing and (ii) internal control reviews related to the planned adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in 2018.

[END TABLE]
Utilization of De Minimis Approval Exemption. Zero percent of the Principal Accounting Firm Fees listed above were approved under the approval provisions of Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X. 
Pre-Approval Policies. The Audit Committee maintains policies and procedures for the pre-approval of work performed by the independent auditors since, under the amended and restated Audit Committee Charter, all auditor engagements must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.

Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
Joseph M. Field served as our Chairman since our inception in 1968 through the completion of our merger with CBS Radio Inc. on November 17, 2017 (the "CBS Radio Merger"). Joseph M. Field served as our Chief Executive Officer from our inception until 2002. Upon completion of the CBS Radio Merger, David J. Field was elected as our Chairman. David J. Field was elected as our Chief Executive Officer in 2002. While the roles of CEO and Chairman were split from 2002 through 2017, we do not have a policy requiring the bifurcation of these two positions. 
David J. Berkman has served as our Independent Lead Director since October 2017. The responsibilities of the Lead Director will include, but are not limited to: presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, chairing executive sessions of the Board, serving as the principal liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, approving   information sent to the Board, approving meeting agendas for the Board, and approving Board meeting schedules to ensure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items. The Lead Director shall have the authority to call meetings of the independent directors. If requested by major shareholders, the Lead Director shall ensure that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication. 
As of March 22, 2019, Joseph M. Field, our Chairman Emeritus, beneficially owned 11,344,334 shares of our Class A common stock; and 3,295,949 shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 25.4% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock.

In accordance with NYSE requirements, our Audit Committee's charter provides that it is responsible for discussing with management our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. In addition, our Audit Committee also discusses with management our significant risk exposures (including financial and cyber risks) and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. While the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, our entire Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company. The full Board also engages in periodic discussions with our CEO, CFO, and other company officers as the board may deem appropriate. In addition, each of our board committees considers the risks within its area of responsibilities. We believe that the leadership structure of our board supports the Board's effective oversight of the Company's risk management.

 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
2018 Transactions 
During 2018 there were no, and currently there are no proposed, transactions in which we were or are to be a participant where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, which would be required to be disclosed herein pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval, or Ratification 
Our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, adopted a Related Party Transactions Policy. This policy provides that Interested Transactions with Related Parties, as defined in the policy, are subject to approval or ratification. 
For purposes of the policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an "Interested Transaction" is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar  transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which: (i) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year; (ii) we are a participant;  and (iii) any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than ten percent beneficial owner of another entity).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a "Related Party" is any: (i) person who is or was (since the beginning of the last year  for which we have filed a Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if they do not presently serve in that role) an executive officer, Director or nominee for election as a Director; (ii) beneficial owner of greater than five percent of our common  stock; or (iii) immediate family members of any of the foregoing. Immediate family members include a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and  brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone not falling into one of the foregoing categories who resides in such person's home (other than a tenant or employee).  
[END TABLE]
Under this policy, our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews the material facts relating to all Interested Transactions that require the Committee's approval and either approves or disapproves of our entry into the Interested Transaction, subject to certain exceptions. If advance approval of an Interested Transaction by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is not feasible, then the Interested Transaction shall be considered and, if the Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at the Committee's next regularly scheduled meeting. In determining whether to approve or ratify an Interested Transaction, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the Interested Transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the Related Person's interest in the transaction. 
Standing Pre-Approval for Certain Interested Transactions 
Under the policy, certain transactions are deemed to be pre-approved by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed $100,000. These transactions include: (i) employment of executive officers; (ii) director compensation; (iii) certain transactions with other companies; (iv) certain charitable contributions; (v) transactions where all shareholders receive proportional benefits; and (vi) transactions involving competitive bids.  COMPENSATION INFORMATION 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OVERVIEW. The Compensation Committee (or the "Committee") of our Board of Directors consists of David J. Berkman, Chairman, Joel Hollander and Mark R. LaNeve. Our Committee reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives with respect to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. Our Committee is responsible for evaluating our Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of these goals and objectives and, based upon this evaluation, will set our Chief Executive Officer's compensation. In addition, our Committee reviews and sets the compensation of the executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer. Our Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to our Board regarding director compensation. Finally, our Committee reviews and makes recommendations to our Board regarding our incentive compensation and equity-based plans and arrangements. Our Committee's duties are memorialized in its charter, which is available on our website at www.entercom.com. 
Our executive officer compensation programs are comprised of the following elements: (i) base salary; (ii) incentive compensation (including annual discretionary incentive bonuses of both cash and equity); and (iii) other compensation such as employee benefit plans, including our 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, deferred compensation plan, health insurance and life/disability insurance. Our executive officer compensation programs are designed to motivate our executive officers to attain financial, operational and strategic objectives. These programs generally provide incentives to achieve both annual and longer-term objectives. In making executive compensation determinations, we assess both the performance of our business and the performance of our executives relative to those objectives. 
Our compensation policy has been to provide competitive compensation while also seeking to align the financial goals of our executives with those of our shareholders. The Committee selectively utilizes performance based equity awards to further this alignment. To ensure that pay is competitive, we periodically compare our pay practices with those of our competitors and the general competitive market for executive talent. We also consider the performance of our business as compared to the performance of our competitors. 
Our Named Executive Officers during 2018 were: 
We are party to an employment agreement with each of our current Named Executive Officers. 
PROCESS. Our Committee meets on a regularly scheduled basis at least two times per year, and typically more frequently as our Committee deems necessary or desirable. During 2018, the Committee met seven times. In addition, members of our Committee monitor executive compensation trends and discuss compensation matters with our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and among themselves informally throughout the year. This informal process facilitates the on-going monitoring of the appropriateness of our executive compensation packages and serves to prepare our Committee members for the formal meetings so that definitive compensation decisions can be more easily made at such meetings. In addition, our Committee from time to time has utilized and relied upon the analysis and recommendations of independent compensation consultants. In 2018, the Committee utilized the services of Lockton Companies, LLC to assist in evaluating our practices under our Entercom Equity Compensation Plan. 
Our Committee is involved in compensation considerations throughout the year. The process for annual compensation changes and incentive compensation grants typically includes Committee deliberation as well as reports and recommendations made by management at the request of the Committee. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer presents a report which highlights our performance as a company and the performance of our Chief Executive Officer during the preceding year, as well as compensation previously earned by senior management in prior years. Our Chief Executive Officer then provides our Committee with a recommendation for our executive officer compensation. While no formal process for determining executive compensation is prescribed in the Committee's charter or otherwise, this informal process has evolved over time.  The process of determining compensation also involves our Committee's consideration of peer compensation levels. While our Committee does not have a policy regarding benchmarking, our Committee does consider peer compensation when establishing compensation levels. The only manner in which peer compensation levels were used by the Committee in 2018 was as set forth below under the heading "Determination of Incentive Compensation." 
Once it receives and considers the various pieces of information, reports and presentations described above, our Committee then meets without our Chief Executive Officer or other management present to determine the appropriate level of compensation. Our Committee sets the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer as well as the other Named Executive Officers. 
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION. 
Base Salary. In setting base salaries for our Named Executive Officers, our Committee generally considers (i) the experience, capabilities, qualities, performance record and relative effectiveness of the individual, (ii) the scope and complexity of the position, (iii) our size relative to the revenue of other media companies; and (iv) the compensation paid by our competitors. In particular, we attempt to set base salaries at levels that are competitive in the industry and in relation to the particular job function of the executive officer. 
The annual base salary is intended to reward the executive officer for the day-to-day demands, complexities and difficulties of such officer's job. The objective is to set base salaries at levels that the Committee and the applicable executive officer believe are fair, given the job functions and their individual performance and experience in relation to those job functions. The Committee attempts to provide annual base salaries that will help to retain the executives and discourage them from seeking or accepting other employment opportunities. 
Incentive Compensation. Our Committee has historically utilized two forms of incentive compensation: cash bonuses and equity awards. The cash component is designed to convey an immediate benefit for services performed by the recipient over a period of less than one year, while the equity component is generally tied to multi-year vesting requirements (both time based and performance based) and is primarily designed to retain and motivate the recipient and align the recipient's interest with the interests of our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Cash Bonus Awards. All of our Named Executive Officers are eligible to receive cash bonuses  which are determined after a review of our overall performance as well as the individual performance of each such executive officer. For 2018, each Named Executive Officer received a cash bonus as described in the Summary Compensation Table and  below in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading "Named Executive Officer Compensation."  
[END TABLE]
The decision to increase or decrease cash bonuses from year to year is generally based on a variety of factors that our Committee deems appropriate, including our overall performance, the individual executive's performance, the business environment which existed during the year and any extraordinary events that arose during the course of the year. We believe this flexibility and our history of appropriately rewarding performance provide a strong incentive to our executive officers to perform in a manner that will allow us to achieve our corporate objectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity Compensation. To promote our long-term objectives, the Entercom Equity Compensation Plan  permits awards to our executive officers who are in a position to make a significant contribution to our long-term success. Such equity awards are permitted to be made in the form of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock  appreciation rights and restricted stock / restricted stock unit awards.  
[END TABLE]
Determination of Incentive Compensation. In order to determine the incentive compensation for our senior executive officers (including David J. Field, our Chief Executive Officer), our Committee considered a number of factors including those detailed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• While the Company fell short of its 2018 financial goals, the Company was successful in 'achieving its  aggressive integration and transformative developmental and strategic goals. Notably, the Committee considered that:

For purposes of market performance, we considered the performance of commercial radio stations within each market where we operate. For purposes of the stock performance analysis, we considered our Radio Peer: Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc.; and our TV Peers: Gray Television, Inc., Nexstar Media Group, Inc., Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. and Tegna, Inc.  Broadcast Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Earnings per Share are "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
We calculate Broadcast Cash Flow (or BCF) as operating income (loss) before: depreciation and amortization; time brokerage agreement fees (income); corporate general and administrative expenses; non-cash compensation expense (which is otherwise included in station operating expenses); impairment loss; merger and acquisition costs, other expenses related to the refinancing and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; and gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets. 
We calculate Free Cash Flow as operating income (loss): (i) plus depreciation and amortization; net (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets; non-cash compensation expense (which is otherwise included in station operating expenses and corporate general and administrative expenses); impairment loss; merger and acquisition costs; other expenses related to the refinancing; other income and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; income from discontinued operations (excluding income taxes or tax benefit); and (ii) less net interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs or debt premium), preferred stock dividends, adjusted taxes paid, capital expenditures and amortizable intangibles. 
We calculate Adjusted Earnings as net income (loss) available to common shareholders adjusted to exclude: (i) income taxes (benefit) as reported, including income taxes otherwise included in income from discontinued operations; (ii) gain/loss on sale of assets, derivative instruments and investments; (iii) non-cash compensation expense; (iv) other income; (v) impairment loss; (vi) merger and acquisition costs, other expenses related to the refinancing, loss on extinguishment of debt and non-recurring expenses recognized for restructuring charges or similar costs, including transition and integration costs; and (vii) gain/loss on early extinguishment of debt. For purposes of comparability, income taxes are reflected at the expected statutory federal and state income tax rate of 30% without discrete items of tax. To calculate adjusted earnings per share we divide by Weighted Average Shares – Diluted. 
In order to assist our Committee in determining the level of Mr. Field's incentive compensation, our Committee reviewed Mr. Field's performance in light of these goals and objectives. In conducting such a review, our Committee also considered many of the factors discussed above under "Determination of Incentive Compensation." 
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Field's target bonus was 200% of his base salary. In determining the actual amount of Mr. Field's bonus, the Committee considered the goals and objectives listed above. Specifically, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to achieving our 2018 business plan, the Committee found this goal not to have been achieved.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to exceeding our peer group's operating performance, the Committee found this goal not to have  been achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to exceeding our peer stock price performance, the Committee found this goal to have been achieved  with respect to our radio peer but not achieved with respect to our TV Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to executing our strategic plans, the Committee found this goal to have been achieved.   
[END TABLE]
Our Committee did not adopt, nor did it employ, any objective quantifiable standards. Instead, our Committee's ultimate determination for 2018 was based upon a subjective evaluation of Mr. Field's overall performance as well as all of the relevant factors identified above. The Committee then subjectively awarded Mr. Field a cash bonus of $1.73 million. This amount represents approximately 70% of the target bonus (i.e., 200% of his base salary) payable pursuant to Mr. Field's employment agreement. 
Other Compensation. Our Committee has provided for a number of additional elements of benefit based compensation. These components are designed to accomplish a variety of objectives including: (i) maximizing the full benefit under applicable tax regulations (e.g., our 401(k) plan); (ii) providing for the health and welfare of our executives and their families (e.g., our medical, disability and life insurance plans); (iii) conveying a level of security in the context of any possible change of control (e.g., our general severance policy as well as specific severance and change of control agreements); and (iv) providing executives with an appropriate level of perquisites (e.g., our car allowance policy). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 401(k) Plan. We maintain a 401(k) Plan which is generally available to all of our full-time  employees. Executive officer participation in this plan is on the same basis as our other employees. All of our Named Executive Officers participate in our 401(k) Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deferred Compensation Plans. We maintain deferred compensation plans for our corporate and station  management employees as well as our non-employee directors. Under each plan, participants are permitted to defer a portion of their compensation for specific time periods. Our obligations under such plans are unsecured. Effective January 1,  2018, further contributions under these plans have been frozen beginning with any contribution elections covering the 2018 year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employee Benefit Plans. We have a number of benefit plans available to all of our full-time  employees. These benefits include Medical Insurance, Dental Insurance, voluntary Short-Term Disability Insurance, Long-Term Disability Insurance, Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance, a MEDEX Travel Assist Program and  Vision Insurance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In order to promote alignment with shareholder value creation, we  maintain an Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which participating employees can purchase up to $25,000 of our Class A common stock per year at a discount of up to 15%. Purchases are made four times per year and are funded through payroll  deductions  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance and Change-of-Control Benefits. We have a severance policy which is applicable to all of  our employees. Under this policy, full-time employees are eligible for up to fifteen weeks of severance (subject to certain requirements). Our employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers govern severance for those officers. In  addition, Mr. Field's employment agreement contains certain provisions which are effective upon a change of control. Mr. Field waived these provisions for purposes of the CBS Radio merger. The applicable severance and change of  control provisions for each such officer are described below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Personal Usage of Jet Card. We participate in a limited jet card program. We permit our Chairman,  CEO/President, Chairman Emeritus and other executive officers approved by our CEO/President to use our jet card for personal use, subject to the terms of our Aircraft Usage Policy. Under this policy, our executives must reimburse us for all usage  and other incremental charges relating to any such flight(s). While this personal usage is by definition a perquisite, as it is not generally available to all of our employees, there is no associated dollar value of compensation since the executives  reimburse us for the entire cost for each personal flight.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Car Allowance. Each of our Named Executive Officers, other than Robert Philips and Andrew P. Sutor,  is provided with either a car allowance or use of a company-owned vehicle.  
[END TABLE]
TAX AND ACCOUNTING ISSUES RELATING TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 
Overview. Section 162(m) of the Code imposes limitations upon the federal income tax deductibility of certain compensation paid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and to each of our other three most highly compensated executive officers. Under these limitations, we may deduct such compensation only to the extent that during any year the compensation paid to any such officer does not exceed $1,000,000 or meets certain limited conditions. The Committee believes that it is in our best interests to retain flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards to foster achievement of goals the Committee deems important to our success, including for example encouraging employee retention, rewarding achievement of non-quantifiable goals, and achieving progress with specific projects. 
Our Committee also takes accounting considerations, including the impact of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, into account in structuring compensation programs and determining the form and amount of compensation awarded. 
SECURITY OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS / GUIDELINES. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Company's non-employee directors to acquire and continually hold equity interests representing at least three times the annual cash retainer paid to each director by the later of: (a) the third anniversary of director service; and (b) three years from July 18, 2017. Once the required objective ownership has been achieved the target will be deemed to be continuously met regardless of future share price fluctuations and provided that the ownership of the shares utilized to meet the target are maintained. We do not have a similar requirement relating to Named Executive Officer ownership of our shares. 
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION. 
David J. Field, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our Principal Executive Officer is David J. Field. Mr. Field serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to an employment agreement dated April 22, 2016, as   amended on November 16, 2017 and October 11, 2018. This agreement has an initial term of four years with automatic one year extensions following the initial term unless either party provides prior notice of non-extension. Mr. Field's agreement provides for: (i) an annual base salary and (ii) an annual cash performance-based bonus target of 200% of his annual base salary. Mr. Field's salary for 2018 was $1,204,152. In addition, Mr. Field receives certain other benefits as provided from time to time to our senior executive officers as described above.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination / Severance Compensation. Mr. Field's employment agreement may be terminated by  either party. In the event that Mr. Field is terminated by us without cause (as defined in the agreement) or he resigns for good reason (as defined in his agreement) prior to the execution of a binding agreement which would result in a change  in control (as defined in his agreement), if consummated, or more than two years following a change in control, subject to his execution of a release of claims against us, all of Mr. Field's outstanding equity compensation awards that vest  on the basis of our performance will become fully vested and we will pay him a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the greater of: (i) the sum of two years' annual base salary and two times the highest annual bonus paid during the  preceding three-year period and (ii) the sum of the base salary and annual bonuses that would otherwise have been payable through the end of the then current term of the agreement. If such termination occurs (a) following the execution of  a binding agreement which would result in a change in control if consummated; or (b) prior to the two-year anniversary of a change in control; in each case subject to his execution of a release of claims against us, all of Mr. Field's  outstanding equity compensation awards will become fully vested, and we will pay him a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the sum of three years' annual base salary and three times the highest annual bonus paid to him during the preceding  three-year period. We will also pay his COBRA premiums for continued health coverage, to the extent he elects such coverage, for a period of up to eighteen months. On October 11, 2018, the Company and Mr. Field agreed to amend  Mr. Field's employment agreement to remove and eliminate the concept of any tax gross-up payments upon a termination and change of control to the extent that any payments upon such termination were subject to the excise tax  imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
[END TABLE]
Furthermore, in the event that Mr. Field dies or becomes disabled, then all of Mr. Field's outstanding equity compensation awards that vest on the basis of our performance will become fully vested and we will pay him (or his estate, if applicable) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the sum of two years' annual base salary and two times the highest annual bonus paid during the preceding three-year period, and we will also pay his COBRA premiums for continued health coverage, to the extent he elects such coverage, for a period of up to eighteen months. 
Finally, Mr. Field's agreement also provides that in the event of a change in control where Mr. Field's employment is terminated within 24 months thereof, all of Mr. Field's then outstanding equity compensation awards will become fully vested and exercisable. Mr. Field waived the change in control provisions with respect to the CBS Radio merger transaction.

[END TABLE]
For equity incentive plan awards that are subject to market conditions (in addition to service conditions), the fair value and expected term was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses certain variables such as expected volatility, a risk free interest rate and expected dividends. The Monte Carlo method begins with the fair value of the stock price on the date of grant and applies a discount based upon the probability of the stock vesting after meeting the market conditions. The fair values of the Company's stock at the time of the November 28, 2017, April 22, 2016 and February 10, 2016 grants were $12.20 per share, $11.15 per share, and $9.39 per share, respectively, and after applying the valuation model discount, the values used in this chart were $9.81 per share, $7.42 per share, and   $5.45 per share, respectively.

 CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation David J. Field, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, to the annual total compensation of the Company's median employee (excluding the CEO). 
Mr. Field, our CEO, had total compensation of $3,491,375, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above. We estimate that: 
(i) the median of the 2018 total compensation for all employees of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, other than our CEO, was $48,794 (the "Median Compensation"); and 
(iii) the ratio of our CEO's 2018 total compensation to the Median Compensation was approximately 72 to 1. 
We note that, due to our permitted use of reasonable estimates and assumptions in preparing this pay ratio disclosure, the disclosure may involve a degree of imprecision, and thus this ratio disclosure is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions described below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received the Median Compensation as the "Median Employee." 
For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was December 28, 2018 (the "Determination Date"). As of the Determination Date, our total population consisted of 7,750 employees (excluding the CEO), of which all were located in the United States.
For purposes of this pay ratio disclosure, Median Compensation was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for 2018 in accordance with item 402(c) (2)(x) of Regulation S-K. To identify the Median Employee, we measured total compensation using our payroll and employment records as reported on each employee's summary payroll register for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 28, 2018. For those full-time employees who were on the payrolls as of the Determination Date and had been hired during the year, we annualized their compensation for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 28, 2018. We did not utilize any statistical sampling or cost-of-living adjustments for purposes of this pay ratio disclosure. We did not apply any exclusions of employee wages or employees.

(1)   On January 1 of each year, the number of shares of Class A common stock authorized under the Entercom  Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is automatically increased by 1.5 million, or a lesser number as may be determined by our Board. On November 30, 2017, we filed a registration statement on Form S-8 to register an  additional 2,941,525 shares under the Plan. These additional shares were registered in order to address CBS equity compensation awards which were being converted to our awards in connection with the Merger. As of December 31, 2018: (i) the  maximum number of shares authorized under the Plan was 14.8 million shares; and (ii) 1.7 million shares remain available for future grant under the Plan. The amount of shares available for grant automatically increased by  1.5 million on January 1, 2019 to 3.2 million shares.  
[END TABLE]
ENTERCOM EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN 
Overview. In 2014 the Plan was amended and restated again to extend the Plan through February 2, 2024. The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain our employees, employees of our subsidiaries (including employees who are Named Executive Officers or Directors) and to provide incentives to our non-employee Directors and certain advisors and consultants who perform services for us and our subsidiaries. The Plan provides for grants of: (i) options intended to qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs") within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code; (ii) "nonqualified stock options" that are not intended to so qualify ("NQSOs"); (iii) restricted stock / restricted stock units; and (iv) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). 
Shares. As of March 22, 2019, an aggregate of 16.3 million shares of Class A Common Stock are authorized for issuance under the Plan, of which 1.8 million remain available for issuance. The Plan as originally amended and restated in 2005 initially authorized 8.5 million shares, plus an additional 1.5 million shares per year (effective each January 1). For January 1, 2007-08 and 2013-17, our Board of Directors determined that no additional shares would be added to the Plan, while for each of January 1, 2006, 2009-2012 and 2018-2019 the additional 1.5 million shares were added to the Plan. In addition, as a result of the Company's 2006 Option Exchange Program (pursuant to which options surrendered net of restricted stock issued were not available for reissuance) and the Company's 2009 Option Exchange Program (pursuant to which all options surrendered were not available for reissuance) the number of shares that can be issued under the Plan was effectively reduced by an aggregate of 5.7 million shares. Finally, in connection with our merger with CBS Radio, CBS equity awards were converted into 2.9 million equity awards under the Plan. Accordingly, the following table shows the shares that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Initial Authorized Amount (as of Feb 2005)      8,500,000   
 Annual Increases (2006, 2009-2012 & 2018-2019)      10,500,000   
 2006 Option Exchange Program Decrease      (3,574,376) 
 2009 Option Exchange Program Decrease      (2,084,518) 
 Equity Awards issued in connection with CBS Radio Merger      2,941,525   
 TOTAL      16,282,631   
[END TABLE]
 Only shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued under the Plan. The number of shares for which ISOs may be issued under the Plan may not exceed 1.85 million shares, subject to adjustment. If and to the extent grants awarded under the Plan expire or are terminated for any reason without being exercised, the shares of Class A Common Stock subject to such grant will again be available for purposes of the Plan. 
Administration of the Plan. The Plan is administered and interpreted by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors. The Committee shall consist of two or more persons who may be "outside directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and related Treasury regulations and "non-employee directors" as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Subject to ratification or approval by the Board if the Board retains such right, the Committee has authority to: (i) determine the individuals to whom grants shall be made under the Plan; (ii) determine the type, size and terms of the grants to be made to each such individual; (iii) determine the time when grants will be made and the commencement and duration of any applicable exercise or restriction period, including the criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability; and (iv) deal with any other matters arising under the Plan. 
Eligibility for Participation. The following are eligible to be participants in the Plan ("Participants"): (i) all of our employees and employees of our subsidiaries ("Employees"), including Employees who are officers or members of the Board; (ii) members of the Board who are not Employees ("Non-Employee Directors"); and (iii) those consultants and advisors who perform services for us or any of our subsidiaries ("Key Advisors"), but such Key Advisors must be natural persons rendering bona fide services and such services must not be in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. The aggregate number of shares of our stock that may be granted to any individual during any calendar year may not exceed 925,000 shares. 
Change of Control. Upon a Change of Control, unless the Committee determines otherwise: (i) each Grantee with outstanding Grants shall receive written notice of such Change of Control; (ii) all outstanding Options and SARs shall automatically accelerate and become fully exercisable; and (iii) the restrictions and conditions on all outstanding restricted stock shall immediately lapse. Upon a Change of Control where we are not the surviving corporation (or survive only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding Options and SARs that are not exercised shall be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options and rights by, the surviving corporation. A Change of Control is defined as: (i) any person becoming a beneficial owner of securities of us representing more than 50% of all votes required to elect a majority of the Board, provided that a Change of Control shall not be deemed to occur as a result of a change of ownership resulting from the death of a shareholder; (ii) the consummation by us of: (a) a merger or consolidation where our shareholders will not own more than 50% of all votes required to elect a majority of the Board of Directors of the surviving corporation, or (b) the consummation of an agreement providing for the sale or disposition by us of all or substantially all of our assets; (iii) a liquidation or dissolution of us; or (iv) any person completing a tender offer or exchange offer for shares representing more than 50% of all votes required to elect a majority of our Board. 
In connection our merger with CBS Radio, our Compensation Committee elected to not accelerate vesting or lapse restrictions of any equity awards outstanding as of, or issued in connection with, the consummation of the transaction.  BOARD OF DIRECTOR
