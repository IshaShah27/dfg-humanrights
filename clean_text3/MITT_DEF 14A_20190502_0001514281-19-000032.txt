[END TABLE]

Q: What is the quorum for the meeting? 
A: A quorum will be present at the Annual Meeting if a majority of the votes entitled to be cast are present, in person or by proxy. No business may be conducted at the Annual Meeting if a quorum is not present. As of the Record Date, 32,199,742 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. If less than a majority of outstanding shares entitled to vote are represented at the Annual Meeting, we expect that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many votes do I have?

[END TABLE]

A:   Proposal      Vote Required    Discretionary Voting Allowed? 
A:   Proposal      Vote Required    Discretionary Voting Allowed? 
  (1) Election of directors   Plurality**   No 
  (2) Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   Majority*   Yes 
  (3) Advisory vote on our executive compensation   Majority*   No 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
A: If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are the "stockholder of record" of those shares. 
  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares. The Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") and proxy statement and any accompanying documents have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote? 
A: Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to authorize your proxy to vote your shares over the Internet as described in the Notice. Alternatively, if you received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, please complete, date, sign and promptly return the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. Authorizing your proxy over the Internet, by mailing a proxy card or by telephone will not limit your right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote my shares that are held by my broker? 
A: If you have shares held by a broker, you may instruct your broker to vote your shares by following the instructions that the broker provides to you. Most brokers allow you to authorize your proxy by mail, telephone and on the Internet. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I attend the Annual Meeting? 
A: All stockholders are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. An admission ticket, or an account statement showing your ownership of our common stock as of the Record Date, and some form of photo identification (such as a valid driver's license or passport) will be required for admission to the Annual Meeting. Only stockholders who own Company common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date and invited guests will be entitled to attend the Annual Meeting. Your proxy card and/or Notice can serve as your admission ticket and as verification of your ownership. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Why did I not receive my proxy materials in the mail? 
A: As permitted by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are making this proxy statement and our 2018 annual report, which includes our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 ("Annual Report"), available to our stockholders electronically via the Internet. The "e-proxy" process expedites stockholders' receipt of proxy materials and lowers the costs and reduces the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. 
  On or about March 22, 2019, we mailed to stockholders of record, as of the close of business on the Record Date, the Notice containing instructions on how to access this proxy statement, our Annual Report and other soliciting materials via the Internet. If you received the Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you had previously indicated that you wanted to receive a printed copy. The Notice instructs you on how to access the proxy statement and Annual Report and how you may submit your proxy. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Will there be any other items of business on the agenda? 
A: The board of directors does not know of any other matters that may be brought before the Annual Meeting nor does it foresee or have reason to believe that proxy holders will have to vote for substitute or alternate nominees for election to the board of directors. In the event that any other matter should come before the Annual Meeting or any nominee is not available for election, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will have discretionary authority to vote all proxies with respect to such matters in accordance with their discretion. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Will anyone contact me regarding this vote? 
A: No arrangements or contracts have been made with any solicitors as of the date of this proxy statement, although we reserve the right to engage solicitors if we deem them necessary. Such solicitations may be made by mail, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or in person. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who has paid for this proxy solicitation? 
A: We pay for the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the Notice and, to the extent requested by our stockholders, the proxy materials and any additional materials furnished to stockholders. Proxies may be solicited by our directors or our officers or by officers of AG REIT Management, LLC (our "Manager") personally or by telephone without additional compensation for such activities. We will also request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names or in the names of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, to send appropriate solicitation materials to such beneficial owners, and we will pay such holders their standard and ordinary fees. We will also reimburse such holders for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: May stockholders ask questions at the Annual Meeting? 
A: Yes. There will be time allotted at the end of the meeting when our representatives will answer questions from the floor. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice? 
A: It probably means your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account. Sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all your shares are voted. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What if I return a signed proxy or voting instruction card, but do not specify how my shares are to be voted? 
A: If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a proxy, but you do not provide voting instructions, all of your shares will be voted FOR Proposals 1, 2, and 3. 
  If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the broker or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), brokers and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as Proposal 2, but do not have discretion to vote on non-routine matters, such as Proposals 1 and 3. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, your broker or other nominee may only vote your shares on Proposal 2 and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
A: Under NYSE rules, brokers or other nominees who hold shares for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on a limited number of "routine" proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive such voting instructions and does not have the discretion to vote the shares. The uncontested election of directors and the advisory vote on executive compensation are not considered "routine" matters for which brokers have discretionary authority to vote shares held by account holders. Pursuant to Maryland law, abstentions and broker non-votes are not included in the determination of the shares of common stock voting on such matters, but are counted for quorum purposes. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Can I change my vote after I have voted? 
A: Yes. Proxies properly submitted over the Internet, by mail or by telephone do not preclude a stockholder from voting in person at the Annual Meeting. A stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by filing a duly executed revocation of proxy with our General Counsel by properly submitting, either by Internet, mail or telephone, a proxy to our General Counsel bearing a later date or by appearing at the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself constitute revocation of a proxy. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Can I find additional information on the Company's web site? 
A: Yes. Our web site (the "Company's Web Site") is located at www.agmit.com. Although the information contained on the Company's Web Site is not part of this proxy statement, you can view additional information on the Company's Web Site, such as our corporate governance guidelines, our code of business conduct and ethics, charters of our board committees and reports that we file with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our nominating and corporate governance committee analyzes the composition of our board of directors each year. In connection with this review, the nominating and corporate governance committee concluded that each of our current board members should be nominated to serve another term. Accordingly, our board of directors agreed with all of these conclusions.
At the Annual Meeting, directors will be elected to serve until the 2020 annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Our board of directors has nominated the following individuals, David N. Roberts, T.J. Durkin, Brian C. Sigman, Arthur Ainsberg, Andrew L. Berger, Debra Hess, Joseph LaManna and Peter Linneman (each a "Nominee," and, collectively, the "Nominees"), to serve as directors until the 2020 annual meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The board of directors anticipates that, if elected, each Nominee will serve as a director. However, if any Nominee is unable to accept election, the proxies will be voted for the election of such other person or persons as the board of directors may recommend.
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD:
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
The voting requirements for this proposal are described above and in the "Questions and Answers" section.  
DIRECTOR NOMINEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Information Regarding Director Nominees
We believe that all of the Nominees are intelligent, collegial, insightful, proactive with respect to management and risk oversight, diligent and exercise good judgment. The biographical descriptions below set forth certain information with respect to each Nominee for election as a director at the Annual Meeting, including the age of each Nominee as of the date of this proxy statement, and the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Nominee that led us to conclude that such person should serve as a director.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board of Directors and Committees
Our Manager manages our day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of our Manager's day-to-day duties and obligations arising under our management agreement. Members of our board of directors are kept informed of our business through discussions with our Manager's executive officers, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in meetings of the board of directors and its committees. A majority of the members of our board of directors are "independent," as determined by the requirements of the NYSE and the regulations of the SEC. Our directors also keep informed about our business through supplemental reports and communications provided to them. Our independent directors meet in executive sessions without the presence of our corporate officers or non-independent directors.
Our board of directors has formed an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee and has adopted charters for each of these committees. Each of these committees is composed exclusively of independent directors, as defined by the listing standards of the NYSE and, as it relates to the audit committee, Rule 10A-3(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Moreover, the compensation committee is composed exclusively of individuals intended to be, to the extent provided by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, non-employee directors and will, at such times as we are subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), qualify as outside directors for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Board Leadership
Our business is conducted day-to-day by our officers and our Manager, under the direction of our chief executive officer and the oversight of our board of directors, to enhance long-term value for our stockholders. Our board of directors is elected by our stockholders to oversee our officers and our Manager and to assure that the long-term interests of the stockholders are being served.
The board of directors annually appoints a chairman of the board, who may or may not be our chief executive officer. If the individual appointed as chairman of the board is our chief executive officer, the board of directors will also appoint a lead independent director. David N. Roberts has served as chief executive officer of the Company since our initial public offering in 2011 and as chairman of the board since the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders. In these capacities, Mr. Roberts is involved in both our day-to-day operations and the strategic decision making at the board level.
We believe that it is in the best interests of our stockholders for Mr. Roberts to serve as both chairman of the board and chief executive officer because of his decisive, consistent and effective leadership. We also believe that having a lead independent director mitigates the risk of our chief executive officer also serving as our chairman, which, in certain circumstances, may cause management to have undue influence on a board of directors. Joseph LaManna serves as our lead independent director. Our lead independent director chairs executive sessions of the independent directors of the board and meetings of the full board of directors when the chairman is absent, and otherwise serves as a liaison between the independent directors, the full board of directors and management.
The board of directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide independent oversight of management. The board of directors understands that there is no single, generally accepted approach to providing board leadership and the right board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Consistent with this understanding, our independent directors consider the board's leadership structure on an annual basis.
Director Independence
Under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE, at least a majority of our directors, and all of the members of our audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees, must be "independent," as such term  is defined in the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The NYSE standards provide that to qualify as an "independent" director, in addition to satisfying certain bright-line criteria, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us). Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of Arthur Ainsberg, Andrew L. Berger, Debra Hess, Joseph LaManna and Peter Linneman satisfies the bright-line independence criteria of the NYSE and that none has a relationship with us that would interfere with such person's ability to exercise independent judgment as a member of the board of directors. Therefore, we believe that all of these directors, who constitute a majority of our board of directors, are independent under the NYSE rules.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted limits on the number of public company boards on which our independent directors may serve, to enable them to have sufficient time to devote to their duties to the Company. Unless approved by the board of directors, our independent directors may not serve on more than four (4) public company boards, which number includes service on our board of directors. The Company does not limit the number of not-for-profit boards on which our independent directors may serve.
We have implemented procedures for interested parties, including stockholders, to communicate directly with our independent directors. We believe that providing a method for interested parties to communicate directly with our independent directors, rather than the full board of directors, provides a more confidential, candid and efficient method of relaying any interested party's concerns or comments. See "Communication with the Board of Directors and Independent Directors."
Nomination of Directors
Before each annual meeting of stockholders, the nominating and corporate governance committee considers the nomination of all directors whose terms expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders and also considers new candidates whenever there is a vacancy on the board of directors or whenever a vacancy is anticipated due to a change in the size or composition of the board of directors, a retirement of a director or for any other reasons. The nominating and corporate governance committee identifies director candidates based on recommendations from directors, stockholders, management and others. The committee may in the future engage the services of third-party search firms to assist in identifying or evaluating director candidates. No such firm was engaged in 2018.
Our nominating and corporate governance committee charter provides that the nominating and corporate governance committee will consider nominations for board membership by stockholders. The rules that must be followed to submit nominations are contained in our bylaws and include the following: (i) the nomination must be received by the committee at least 120 days, but not more than 150 days, before the first anniversary of the mailing date for proxy materials applicable to the annual meeting prior to the annual meeting for which such nomination is proposed for submission and (ii) the nominating stockholder must submit certain information regarding the director nominee, including the nominee's written consent.
The nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates annually the effectiveness of the board of directors as a whole and of each committee and conducts an annual assessment of each independent director. The nominating and corporate governance committee also identifies any areas in which the board of directors would be better served by adding new members with different skills, backgrounds or areas of experience. The board of directors considers director candidates, including those nominated by stockholders, based on a number of factors including: whether the board member will be "independent," as such term is defined by the NYSE listing standards; whether the candidate possesses the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values; whether the candidate contributes to the overall diversity of the board of directors; and whether the candidate has an inquisitive and objective perspective, practical wisdom and mature judgment. Candidates are also evaluated on their understanding of our business, experience and willingness to devote adequate time to carrying out their duties, among other things. The nominating and corporate governance committee also monitors the mix of skills, experience and background of the members of the board of directors to assure that the board of directors has the necessary composition to effectively perform its oversight function.
While we do not have a formal policy about diversity, the board of directors is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which the board nominees are  selected. Each individual is evaluated in the context of the board of directors as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group of directors that includes differences of viewpoint, professional experience, education, skill and other personal qualities and attributes and that can best perpetuate the success of the Company's business and can represent shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment, using its diversity of experience.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
Our board of directors has also adopted corporate governance guidelines, which are available in the corporate governance section of the Company's Web Site. These guidelines set forth the practices the board of directors follows with respect to, among other matters, the composition of the board of directors, director responsibilities, board committees, director access to officers, the Manager and independent advisors, director compensation and performance evaluation of the board of directors. 
Retirement Policy
The board of directors believes that 75 is an appropriate retirement age for directors. Directors generally will not be nominated for re-election at any annual shareholders meeting following their 75th birthday. However, the Board may determine to waive this policy in individual cases.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our board of directors has established a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our officers and directors as well as the employees, officers and directors of our affiliates who provide us services (the "Code of Ethics"). Among other matters, our Code of Ethics is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accurate, complete, objective, relevant, timely and understandable disclosure in our SEC reports and other public communications; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Ethics to appropriate persons identified in the Code of Ethics; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics. 
[END TABLE]
Any waiver of the Code of Ethics may be made only by our board of directors or one of our board committees. The Code of Ethics is posted in the corporate governance section of the Company's Web Site. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to, or a waiver of, a provision of the Code of Ethics by posting such information on the Company's Web Site.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The board of directors is responsible for overseeing our risk management policies and practices. Our executive officers, who are responsible for our day-to-day risk management practices, regularly present to the board of directors on our overall risk profile and the processes by which such risks are mitigated. Our Manager also regularly reports to the board on various matters related to our risk exposure. Through regular and consistent communication, our Manager provides  reasonable assurances to our board of directors that all of our material operational and investment risks, including among others, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and capital market risk, are being addressed.
Board Meetings and Annual Meeting of Stockholders
The board of directors held ten  meetings (including regularly scheduled and special meetings) in 2018, and each director that was a director in 2018 attended at least 75% of the board meetings and each such director also attended at least 75% of his committee meetings. We have a policy that directors attend each annual meeting of stockholders; however, some or all of our directors may be unable to attend the Annual Meeting due to scheduling conflicts or other obligations that may arise. All of our directors in 2018 attended the 2018 annual meeting. The independent directors meet in executive session at least once per quarter during a regularly scheduled board meeting without management. As lead independent director, Mr. LaManna presides at the executive sessions of the independent directors.
Committee Membership
The current committees of the board of directors are the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. The table below provides current membership information.

The compensation committee held four meetings in 2018.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Our nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Messrs. Berger, LaManna and Linneman, each of whom is an independent director under the rules of the NYSE. Mr. Berger chairs our nominating and corporate governance committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for seeking, considering and recommending to our board of directors qualified candidates for election as directors and recommending a slate of nominees for election as directors at each annual meeting of stockholders. The committee also recommends to our board of directors the appointment of each of our executive officers. It also periodically prepares and submits to our board of directors for adoption the committee's selection criteria for director nominees. It reviews and makes recommendations on matters involving the general operation of our board of directors and our corporate governance and annually recommends to our board of directors the nominees for each committee of the board of directors. In addition, the committee annually conducts an evaluation of our board of directors performance.
The nominating and corporate governance committee held four meetings in 2018.
Other Committees
Our board of directors may from time to time establish other committees to facilitate the management of the Company.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our minimum share ownership guidelines for directors, which were updated on October 31, 2017, require that each director acquire and maintain a minimum number of shares equal to four (4) times the basic annual cash retainer payable to non-employee directors within four years of becoming subject to the guidelines. From time to time, the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors will review each director's compliance with the guidelines and may grant exceptions to the guidelines as it deems appropriate. All of our directors are either currently in compliance with the minimum share ownership guidelines or are still within the four year grace period for compliance. Our minimum share ownership guidelines for executive officers became effective in February 2014 and require that our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Chief Financial Officer acquire and maintain a minimum equity investment in our company of 15,000 shares of our common stock. Any executive officer elected to an office subject to the minimum share ownership guidelines after the minimum share ownership guidelines became effective must be compliant within three years of the date of his or her election. Until the minimum equity investment is met, an executive officer subject to the guidelines must retain all of our common stock granted to him or her as compensation. From time to time, the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors will review each executive officer's compliance with the guidelines and may grant exceptions to the guidelines as it deems appropriate and market-competitive on a case-by-case basis. All of our executive officers subject to the minimum share ownership guidelines are currently in compliance therewith.
Policy Prohibiting Pledging and Hedging of Our Securities
Our Policy Prohibiting Pledging and Hedging of AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc. Securities, which became effective in February 2014, applies to each of our directors and officers, and states that each such person is prohibited from (i) making or maintaining any pledges of our securities or otherwise holding our securities in a margin account and (ii) engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to our securities, including, without limitation, the use of financial instruments, such as prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars or exchange funds.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an employee or officer of us or any of our affiliates. None of our executive officers currently serves, or during the past fiscal year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of another entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee.

Pre-Approval Policy
All audit, tax and other services provided to us were reviewed and pre-approved by the audit committee. The audit committee concluded that the provision of such services by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. Circumstances may arise during the following twelve-month period when it may become necessary to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to provide additional services or additional effort that were not contemplated in the original pre-approval by the audit committee. Such additional services require separate approval by the Audit Committee.  
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The audit committee has furnished the following report to stockholders of the Company in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC.
The Company's management has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting, preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and managing the public reporting process. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm ("PwC"), is responsible for forming and expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, in all material respects, and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The audit committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of the acceptability and appropriateness of significant accounting policies and management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The audit committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm matters related to the conduct of the audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The audit committee also reviewed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments made in preparing the consolidated financial statements, as well as the clarity of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
The audit committee has discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. These discussions included, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independent registered public accounting firm's judgments about the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in the Company's consolidated financial statements; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The critical accounting policies and practices used by the Company; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any alternative treatments within U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for policies and practices related to material items that have been discussed with management, including ramifications of the use of such alternative disclosures and treatments and the treatment preferred by the independent registered public accounting firm; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates and the basis for the firm's conclusions regarding the reasonableness of these estimates; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any disagreements with management over the application of accounting principles, the basis for management's accounting estimates, and the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any audit adjustments and any uncorrected consolidated financial statement misstatements; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other material written communications between the independent registered public accounting firm and management. 
[END TABLE]
The audit committee has also received written communications from PwC as required by the PCAOB Rules, including Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence," and has discussed with PwC their independence. In connection with those discussions, PwC advised the audit committee that it identified an issue related to its independence under Rule 2-01 (c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the "Loan Rule").
The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from an audit client or "record or beneficial owners of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities" (referred to as a "more than ten percent owner"). For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Company as well as all affiliates of the Manager, including other subsidiaries of the Manager's parent company, Angelo Gordon (collectively, the Angelo Gordon Investment Complex). PwC informed us that it has relationships with lenders who hold, as record owner, more than ten percent of the shares of certain funds within the Angelo Gordon Investment Complex, which may implicate the Loan Rule.
On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a "no-action" letter to a mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to the audit independence issue described above. In that letter, the SEC confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against a fund that relied on audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances. In connection with prior independence determinations, PwC communicated, as contemplated by the no-action letter, that it believes that it remains objective and impartial and that a reasonable investor possessing all the facts regarding its borrowing and audit relationships would conclude that PwC is able to exhibit the requisite objectivity and impartiality to report on the Company's financial statements as the independent registered public accounting firm.
PwC also represented that it has complied with PCAOB Rule 3526 and affirmed that it is an independent accountant within the meaning of PCAOB Rule 3520. Therefore, the audit committee concluded, and the board of directors confirmed, that PwC should continue as the Company's independent public accounting firm. If a subsequent determination is made that PwC's objectivity and impartiality has been impaired with respect to the planning for and execution of the Company's audit, then the Company may no longer be able to continue to utilize PwC as the Company's auditor and would need to obtain audit services from a different independent registered public accounting firm.
The audit committee reviewed with management the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and the acceptability and appropriateness of significant accounting policies. Based on the reviews and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the audit committee referred to in this report and in the Company's audit committee charter, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors (and the board of directors approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The audit committee also selected and appointed PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and is presenting this appointment to the Company's stockholders for ratification.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
At our 2018 annual meeting, we asked our stockholders to vote, on an advisory basis, to recommend the frequency with which we would provide future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation. At our 2018 annual meeting, 98% of our stockholders who voted on the "say on frequency" proposal voted, on an advisory basis, to hold future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation each year. Taking into consideration the recommendation of the stockholders, our board of directors elected to hold advisory votes on named executive officer compensation each year. In the future, our board of directors may reconsider the frequency with which we hold advisory votes on named executive officer compensation.
Our board of directors is committed to corporate governance best practices and recognizes the significant interest of stockholders in executive compensation matters. We are providing this advisory vote as required pursuant to the rules of the SEC. We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall policies and practices that apply to the compensation of our named executive officers. We will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the other related disclosure."
While this vote is advisory and not binding on us or the compensation committee, it will provide information to us and the compensation committee regarding stockholder sentiment about our executive compensation policies and practices. Our board of directors and our compensation committee value the opinions of our stockholders. To the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns, and the compensation committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation" below, we are externally managed by AG REIT Management, LLC, our Manager, pursuant to the management agreement between our Manager and us. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of our Manager's day-to-day duties and obligations arising under our management agreement. In 2018, we did not have any employees whom we compensated directly with salaries, other cash compensation or stock-based compensation. A portion of our named executive officers' compensation was paid out of funds from the management fees we pay to our Manager and the expense reimbursement we pay to our Manager. We have not paid, and do not intend to pay, any cash compensation to our named executive officers. We do not provide our named executive officers with pension benefits, termination payments or other incidental payments.
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD:
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
The voting requirements for this proposal are described in the "Questions and Answers" section above.  
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our compensation program, objectives and policies for the executive officers named in this proxy statement and our executive officers generally.
Overview of Compensation Program
We have no employees. We are externally managed by our Manager, pursuant to a management agreement between our Manager and us. Because the management agreement provides that our Manager is responsible for managing our affairs, our executive officers, all of whom are employees of our Manager, or an affiliate of our Manager, do not receive cash compensation from us. Instead, our executive officers are compensated by our Manager, or an affiliate of our Manager, in part, with the management fee we pay to our Manager and with the expense reimbursement we provide to our Manager related to compensation. The management agreement provides for our reimbursement to the Manager of the allocable share of annual base salary, bonus, and any related withholding taxes and employee benefits paid to our chief financial officer, general counsel and other non-investment personnel based on the percentage of time those individuals spent on our affairs or another agreed upon methodology fair to the Company. We do not determine the compensation payable to personnel, including our executive officers, by our Manager or its affiliates. Our Manager or its affiliates, in their discretion, determine the levels of base salary, cash incentive compensation and other benefits earned by our executive officers. We have reported the compensation that we reimburse to our Manager for our named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table and in "Other Matters - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" set forth below.
Cash and Other Compensation
Our named executive officers and other personnel who conduct our business are employees of our Manager or its affiliates. Accordingly, we do not pay or accrue any salaries or bonuses for our officers.
Equity-Based Compensation
Our compensation committee may, from time to time, grant equity awards in the form of restricted stock, stock options, restricted stock units or other types of awards to our Manager or to our named executive officers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. These awards are designed to align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders by allowing our named executive officers to share in the creation of value for our stockholders through stock appreciation and dividends. These equity awards are generally subject to vesting requirements over a number of years and are designed to promote the retention of management and to achieve strong performance for our Company. These awards further provide flexibility to us in enabling our Manager to attract, motivate and retain talented individuals.
We believe our equity-based compensation policies are particularly appropriate since we are an externally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. REIT regulations require us to pay at least 90% of our earnings to stockholders as dividends. As a result, we believe that our stockholders are principally interested in receiving attractive risk-adjusted dividends and growth in dividends and book value. Accordingly, we want to provide an incentive to our executive officers that rewards success in achieving these goals. Because we do not have the ability to retain a significant amount of earnings, we believe that equity-based awards serve to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders in receiving attractive risk-adjusted dividends and growth. Additionally, we believe that equity-based awards are consistent with our stockholders' interest in book value growth as these individuals will be incentivized to grow book value for stockholders over time. We believe that this alignment of interests provides an incentive to our executive officers to implement strategies that will enhance our long-term performance and promote growth in dividends and growth in book value.
Our equity incentive plans permit the granting of options to purchase shares of common stock intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Code, and stock options that do not qualify as incentive stock options. The exercise price of each stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our shares of common stock on the  date of grant. The compensation committee will determine the terms of each option, including when each option may be exercised and the period of time, if any, after retirement, death, disability or termination of employment during which options may be exercised. Options become vested and exercisable in installments, and the exercisability of options may be accelerated by the compensation committee. To date, we have not granted any options under our equity plans.
Our equity incentive plans also permit the granting of shares of our common stock in the form of restricted common stock. A restricted common stock award is an award of shares of common stock that may be subject to forfeiture (vesting), restrictions on transferability and such other restrictions, if any, as the compensation committee may impose at the date of grant. The shares may vest and the restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstances, including, without limitation, a specified period of employment or the satisfaction of pre-established criteria, in such installments or otherwise, as our compensation committee may determine.
We may also grant unrestricted shares of common stock, which are shares of common stock awarded at no cost to the participant or for a purchase price determined by the compensation committee, under our equity incentive plans. The compensation committee may also grant restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, and other stock and non-stock-based awards under the equity incentive plans. These awards may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the compensation committee may determine, including, but not limited to, the achievement of certain goals or continued service to us through a specific period. Each award under the plan may not be exercisable more than ten years after the date of grant.
Our equity incentive plans provide that in the event of a change of control of the Company, any award granted thereunder that was not previously vested shall become fully vested and/or payable, and any performance conditions imposed with respect to the awards shall be deemed to be fully achieved.
The compensation committee does not use a specific formula to calculate the number of equity awards and other rights awarded to executives under our incentive plans. Additionally, the compensation committee does not explicitly set future award levels on the basis of what the executives earned from prior awards. While the compensation committee will take past awards into account, it will not solely base future awards in view of those past awards. Generally, in determining the specific amounts to be granted to an individual, the compensation committee will take into account factors such as the individual's position, his or her contribution to our Company, market practices, and the recommendations of our Manager. Neither we nor any committee of the board of directors retained any compensation consultants during 2018.
We have not and do not intend to either backdate stock options or grant stock options retroactively. Presently, we do not have designated dates on which we grant stock option awards. We do not intend to time stock options grants with our release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.
Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Code generally provides that a public company may not deduct compensation in excess of $1 million paid in any fiscal year to any of certain executive officers (who are referred to as "covered employees" in Section 162(m)). We are presently externally managed by our Manager, and we do not compensate our executive officers.  Accordingly, it is unlikely that the deduction limit under Section 162(m) will have any material effect on us.  Nonetheless, as applicable, we will assess the impact of the deduction limit under Section 162(m) to determine what adjustments to our executive compensation practices, if any, we consider appropriate.  However, in order to maintain flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner designed to promote our corporate goals, including retaining and providing incentives to the executive officers, we have not adopted a policy that all compensation must be deductible and may authorize awards or payments to executives that may not be fully deductible if we believe that such payments are in our interest. Compensation in 2018
We did not pay any compensation of any kind to our named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2018. We do not provide any of our executive officers with any cash compensation, pension benefits or nonqualified deferred compensation plans. We have reported the compensation that we reimburse to our Manager for our named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table set forth below.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, 63.6%, or $6.1 million, of the management fee paid by the Company to the Manager would have been allocable to named executive officer compensation based on the percentage of time such officers spent managing our affairs if the Company reimbursed the Manager for all of its named executive officer compensation. Of this compensation, 9.2% was fixed and 90.8% was variable or incentive pay.
Our Manager and its affiliates do not use a specific formula to calculate the variable or incentive pay portion of our named executive officers' compensation. Additionally, our Manager and its affiliates do not explicitly set future variable or incentive compensation on the basis of the compensation the named executive officers earned in prior years. Generally, in determining each executive's variable or incentive pay, our Manager and its affiliates will take into account factors such as the individual's position, his or her contribution to our Company, market practices, and the recommendations of our compensation committee. We did not, nor did our Manager or its affiliates, retain a compensation consultant in connection with the compensation of our named executive officers in 2018.
Grants of Plan Based Awards in 2018 
We did not grant any shares of restricted stock, options, restricted stock units or other incentive compensation to our named executive officers during the year ended December 31, 2018.
On July 1, 2017, we granted 60,000 restricted stock units to our Manager that represent the right to receive an equivalent number of shares of our common stock to be issued if and when the units vest. 19,993 units vested on July 1, 2018. Annual vesting of approximately 20,000 units will occur on each of July 1, 2019 and July 1, 2020. The units do not entitle the participant to the rights of a holder of our common stock, such as dividend and voting rights, until shares are issued in settlement of the vested units.
Our Manager allocated 21,000 of the 60,000 restricted stock units grant to certain of our named executive officers - 5,000 restricted stock units to David Roberts, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, 10,000 restricted stock units to T.J. Durkin, our Chief Investment Officer, 2,000 restricted stock units to Brian C. Sigman, our Chief Financial Officer, and 4,000 restricted stock units to Raul E. Moreno, our General Counsel and Secretary. Each allocation decision made by the Manager was reported to and discussed with our board of directors. As of December 31, 2018, 40,007 restricted stock units remained unvested with 14,002 of those unvested units allocated to our named executive officers.
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
As of December 31, 2018, there were no outstanding awards of equity made to our named executive officers.
Options Exercised and Stock Vested
As of December 31, 2018, we had not issued any outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock to our named executive officers. No options to purchase shares of our common stock or restricted shares of common stock for any of our named executive officers vested in 2018.
Pension Benefits
We do not provide any of our named executive officers with pension benefits. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
We do not provide any of our named executive officers with any nonqualified deferred compensation plans.
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment
We do not have any employment agreements with any of our named executive officers and are not obligated to make any payments to them upon termination of employment.
Potential Post-Employment Payments and Payments on a Change in Control
We do not have any employment agreements with any of our named executive officers and are not obligated to make any post-employment payments to them or any payments upon a change of control, except as described above related to the vesting of equity-based awards upon a change of control.
Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management
We did not pay any compensation of any kind to our named executive officers and did not have any employees during the year ended December 31, 2018. Therefore, our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. We pay our Manager a management fee that is a percentage of our stockholders' equity, as that term is defined in the management agreement. We believe this management fee structure helps guard against our Manager making higher risk investments to achieve higher management fees as might be the case if the management fee was based on total assets or returns on investments. We have designed our compensation policy in an effort to provide the proper incentives to our executive officers and our Manager to maximize our performance in order to serve the best interests of our stockholders. These compensation policies and practices do not place undue emphasis on or incentivize the maximization of net income at the expense of other criteria, such as preservation of capital. Our board of directors monitors our compensation policies and practices to determine whether our risk management objectives are being met.  
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement with management of the Company. Based on that review and discussion, the compensation committee recommended to the board of directors (and the board of directors has approved) that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's proxy statement.

 OTHER MATTERS
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Our Manager is a subsidiary of Angelo Gordon. Three of our current directors (David Roberts, T.J. Durkin, and Brian Sigman), three of our nominated directors (David Roberts, T.J. Durkin, and Brian Sigman), and all of our executive officers are employees of Angelo Gordon or its affiliates.
To avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, our board of directors has approved investment guidelines and policies providing that an investment in any security structured or managed by our Manager and its affiliates, and any sale of our assets to our Manager and its affiliates or any entity managed by our Manager and its affiliates, will comply with all applicable law, our compliance policies, and the compliance policies of Angelo Gordon and our Manager. Our independent directors have approved parameters within which our Manager and its affiliates may act as our counterparty and provide broker, dealer and lending services to us in order to enable transactions to occur in an orderly and timely manner. Angelo Gordon and/or our Manager may in the future change then-existing, or adopt additional, conflicts of interest resolution policies and procedures. Our independent directors periodically review our Manager's and Angelo Gordon's compliance with these conflicts of interest provisions.
Related Person Transaction Policy
Our board of directors has adopted a policy (the "Related Person Transaction Policy") regarding the approval of any "related person transaction," which is any transaction or series of transactions in which we or any of our subsidiaries is or are to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a "related person" (as defined under SEC rules) has a direct or indirect material interest. Under the Related Person Transaction Policy, a related person would need to promptly disclose to our Secretary or Assistant Secretary any related person transaction and all material facts about the transaction. Our Secretary or Assistant Secretary, in consultation with outside counsel, to the extent appropriate, would then assess and promptly communicate that information to the audit committee of our board of directors. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the audit committee will review, approve or ratify such transactions as appropriate. The audit committee will not approve or ratify a related person transaction unless it shall have determined that such transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and does not create a conflict of interest. If we become aware of an existing related person transaction that has not been approved under this policy, the transaction will be referred to the audit committee which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. Our Related Person Transaction Policy requires any director who may be interested in a related person transaction to recuse himself or herself from any consideration of such related person transaction.
Affiliated Transactions Policy
Our board of directors has also adopted a policy (the "Affiliated Transactions Policy") regarding the approval of any transactions with affiliates that are not "related persons," as that term is defined in the Related Person Transaction Policy. The Affiliated Transactions Policy is meant to supplement the existing policies and procedures of the Related Person Transaction Policy. The Affiliated Transactions Policy applies to all transactions between Angelo Gordon, or any entity or account managed by an affiliate of Angelo Gordon, and us (an "Affiliated Transaction"). All Affiliated Transactions must be permitted within our investment guidelines, comply with applicable law, satisfy the requirements of Angelo Gordon's cross trade policy and comply with any other requirement deemed necessary by our General Counsel. On a quarterly basis, our management team delivers a complete list and appropriate supporting documentation of the Affiliated Transactions entered into during the quarter to the audit committee for its review. Based on its consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances, the audit committee will confirm an Affiliated Transaction to our independent directors if, in its determination, such Affiliated Transaction is fair, reasonable and within the Affiliated Transactions Policy. Management Agreement
We entered into a management agreement with AG REIT Management, LLC, our Manager, in connection with our initial public offering. Our management agreement with our Manager provides for the day-to-day management of our operations. Our Manager, pursuant to a delegation agreement dated as of June 29, 2011, has delegated to Angelo Gordon the overall responsibility of our Manager's day-to-day duties and obligations arising under our management agreement.
The management agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with the investment policies that are approved and monitored by our board of directors. Pursuant to the terms of our management agreement, our Manager is obligated to supply us with our management team, including a chief executive officer, chief financial officer and chief investment officer or similar positions, along with appropriate support personnel, to provide the management services to be provided by our Manager to us as described in the management agreement.
We are obligated to reimburse our Manager or its affiliates for the allocable share of the compensation, including, without limitation, annual base salary, bonus, any related withholding taxes and employee benefits, paid to (1) our chief financial officer based on the percentage of his time spent on our affairs, (2) our general counsel based on the percentage of his time spent on our affairs, and (3) other corporate finance, tax, accounting, internal audit, legal, risk management, operations, compliance and other non-investment personnel of our Manager and its affiliates who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. In their capacities as officers or personnel of our Manager or its affiliates, they will devote such portion of their time to our affairs as is necessary to enable us to operate our business. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded $7.2 million of reimbursable expenses payable to the Manager. The Manager waived its right to receive expense reimbursements of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The initial term of the management agreement was three years. The management agreement renews automatically each year for an additional one-year period, unless we or the Manager exercise their respective termination rights. As of the date hereof, no event of termination has occurred. Our Manager is entitled to receive a termination fee from us should the Management Agreement be terminated under certain circumstances.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Manager earned management fees of $9.5 million.
Indemnification Agreements
We have entered into customary indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that obligate us to indemnify them to the to the fullest extent permitted by the charter of the Company, the by-laws of the Company, the Maryland General Corporation Law and otherwise under Maryland law and the Securities Act of 1933, as now or hereafter in force. The agreements require us to indemnify the director or officer against all judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement and all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the director or officer in any proceeding arising out of or in connection with the indemnitees service to the Company. No director or officer will be entitled to indemnification if it is established that one of the prohibitions against indemnification under Maryland law exists.
In addition, each indemnification agreement requires us to advance reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within ten days of the receipt by us of a statement from the director or officer requesting the advance, provided the statement evidences the expenses and is accompanied by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a written affirmation of the director's or officer's good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct was not met. 
[END TABLE]
Each indemnification agreement also provides for procedures for the determination of entitlement to indemnification. Asset Manager
In connection with our investments in residential loans and securitized whole loans, we may engage asset managers to provide advisory, consultation, asset management and other services to formulate and implement strategic plans to help our third-party servicers manage, collect and dispose of loans in a manner that is reasonably expected to maximize the amount of proceeds from each loan. Beginning in November 2015, we engaged Red Creek Asset Management LLC ("Asset Manager"), an affiliate of the Manager and a direct subsidiary of Angelo Gordon, as the asset manager for certain of our residential loans and securitized whole loans. The Asset Manager acknowledges that we will at all times have and retain ownership of all loans and that the Asset Manager will not acquire (i) title to any loan, (ii) any security interest in any loan, or (iii) any other rights or interests of any kind or any nature whatsoever in or to any loan. We pay separate arm's-length asset management fees (as assessed and confirmed periodically by a third party valuation firm) for the Asset Manager's services related to non-performing loans and reperforming loans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the fees paid by us to the Asset Manager totaled $376,055.
Arc Home
On December 9, 2015, we, alongside private funds under the management of Angelo Gordon, through AG Arc LLC, one of our indirect subsidiaries ("AG Arc"), entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Arc Home LLC ("Arc Home"), a Delaware limited liability company. Arc Home, through its subsidiary, originates conforming, Government, Jumbo and other non-conforming residential mortgage loans and retains the associated mortgage servicing rights, as well as purchases additional mortgage servicing rights from third-party sellers and is led by an external management team. The Board of Managers of Arc Home consists of three members appointed by us and affiliates of our Manager. Our investment in Arc Home had a fair value of $20.4 million on December 31, 2018.
Arc Home may sell loans to us or to affiliates of our Manager. Arc Home may also enter into agreements with us, third parties, or affiliates of our Manager to sell rights to receive the excess servicing spread related to its MSRs ("Excess MSRs"). In March 2017, Arc Home entered into an agreement with us to sell Excess MSRs, and as of December 31, 2018, these Excess MSRs had fair value of approximately $27.3 million. In connection with our investments in Excess MSRs purchased through Arc Home, we pay an administrative fee to Arc Home. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the administrative fees paid by us to Arc Home totaled $249,845.
Mortgage Acquisition Trust I LLC
In August 2017, we, alongside private funds under the management of Angelo Gordon, formed Mortgage Acquisition Holding I LLC ("MATH") to conduct a residential mortgage investment strategy. MATH in turn sponsored the formation of an entity called Mortgage Acquisition Trust I LLC ("MATT") to purchase predominantly "Non-QMs," which are residential mortgage loans that are not deemed "qualified mortgage," or "QM," loans under the rules of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Non-QMs are not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. MATT is expected to make an election to be treated as a real estate investment trust beginning with the 2018 tax year. In furtherance of this business, MATH's sponsoring funds have agreed to provide up to $75.0 million of capital to MATH, of which we agreed to provide $33.4 million for use in this mortgage investment business. As of December 31, 2018, we had funded $19.4 million of our total capital commitment and our outstanding commitment was $14.0 million (net of any return of capital to us).
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
As of December 31, 2018, we have granted an aggregate of 74,299 and 40,250 shares of restricted common stock to our independent directors and Manager, respectively, and 120,000 restricted stock units to our Manager under our equity incentive plans. As of December 31, 2018, all the shares of restricted common stock granted to our Manager and independent directors have vested and 79,993 restricted stock units granted to our Manager have vested. Other transactions with affiliates
In June 2016, in accordance with our Affiliated Transactions Policy, we executed two trades whereby we acquired real estate securities from two separate affiliates of the Manager (the "Selling Affiliates"). As of the date of the trades, the securities acquired from the Selling Affiliates had a total fair value of $6.9 million. In each case, the Selling Affiliates sold the real estate securities through a BWIC (Bids Wanted in Competition). Prior to the submission of the BWIC by the Selling Affiliates, we submitted our bid for the real estate securities to the Selling Affiliates. The pre-submission of our bid allowed us to confirm third-party market pricing and best execution.
In February 2017, in accordance with our Affiliated Transactions Policy, we executed one trade whereby we acquired a real estate security from a separate affiliate of the Manager (the "February Selling Affiliate"). As of the date of the trade, the security acquired from the February Selling Affiliate had a total fair value of $2.0 million. The February Selling Affiliate sold the real estate security through a BWIC. Prior to the submission of the BWIC by the February Selling Affiliate, we submitted its bid for the real estate security to the February Selling Affiliate. The pre-submission of our bid allowed us to confirm third-party market pricing and best execution.
In July 2017, in accordance with our Affiliated Transactions Policy, we acquired certain real estate securities from an affiliate of the Manager (the "July Selling Affiliate"). As of the date of the trade, the securities acquired from the July Selling Affiliate had a total fair value of $0.2 million. As procuring market bids for the real estate securities was determined to be impracticable in the Manager's reasonable judgment, appropriate pricing was based on a valuation prepared by an independent third-party pricing vendor. The third-party pricing vendor allowed us to confirm third-party market pricing and best execution.
In October 2017, in accordance with our Affiliated Transactions Policy, we acquired certain real estate securities and loans from two affiliates of the Manager (the "October Selling Affiliates"). As of the date of the trade, the securities and loans acquired from the October Selling Affiliates had a total fair value of $8.4 million. As procuring market bids for the real estate securities and loans were determined to be impracticable in the Manager's reasonable judgment, appropriate pricing was based on a valuation prepared by independent third-party pricing vendors. The third-party pricing vendors allowed us to confirm third-party market pricing and best execution.
In October 2018, in accordance with our Affiliated Transactions Policy, we acquired certain real estate securities and loans from an affiliate of the Manager (the "October 2018 Selling Affiliate"). As of the date of the trade, the real estate securities and loans acquired from the October 2018 Selling Affiliate had a total fair value of $544,000. As procuring market bids for the real estate securities and loans was determined to be impracticable in the Manager's reasonable judgment, appropriate pricing was based on a valuation prepared by independent third-party pricing vendors. The third-party pricing vendors allowed us to confirm third-party market pricing and best execution.

The SEC rules allow for the delivery of a single copy of the Notice or set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, if it is believed the stockholders are members of the same family. This delivery method, known as "householding," will save us printing and mailing costs. Duplicate account mailings will be eliminated by allowing stockholders to consent to such elimination, or through implied consent, if a stockholder does not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Brokers, dealers, banks or other nominees or fiduciaries that hold shares of our common stock in "street" name for beneficial owners of our common stock and that distribute proxy materials and the Notice they receive to beneficial owners may be householding on your behalf. Depending upon the practices of your broker, bank or other nominee or fiduciary, you may need to contact them directly to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household. If you wish to revoke your consent to householding, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee or fiduciary.
If you hold shares of our common stock in your own name as a holder of record, householding will not apply to your shares. Also, if you own shares of our common stock in more than one account, such as individually and also jointly with your spouse, you may receive more than one set of our proxy materials. To assist us in saving money and to provide you with better stockholder services, we encourage registered holders of our stock to have all of your accounts registered in the same name and address. You may do this by contacting the Company's transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, by telephone at (800) 937-5449 or in writing at American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219.
