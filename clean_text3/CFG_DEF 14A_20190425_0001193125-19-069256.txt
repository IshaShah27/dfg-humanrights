         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – PROXY SUMMARY  
[END TABLE]
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Prior to our initial public offering ("IPO") in September 2014 and subsequent separation from The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, our performance had fallen behind peers given balance sheet shrinkage and underinvestment in strategic initiatives, technology and talent over a number of years. 
Over the past four years, we have addressed many of the challenges we faced at our IPO and have consistently demonstrated the ability to set a course, develop a plan, and execute well. Our strategies to drive improvement in performance across the Company have continued and at year end we had exceeded the medium-term return on tangible common equity ("ROTCE") target we established in January 2018. We have met or exceeded analyst expectations for 18 consecutive quarters. We have focused on growing the bank and investing in capabilities, consistently delivering positive operating leverage. This has resulted in improvements across earnings per share ("EPS"), ROTCE and efficiency ratio. We continue to deliver well for all stakeholders, with consistent progress for customers, colleagues and communities, and our regulatory position is solid. We believe we have turned the corner on performance and are now aiming for excellence, on our way towards becoming a top-performing regional bank. We believe we have built a solid foundation with additional levers available to us for continued performance improvement. 
2018 Year-end Achievements

 ROTCE*    ~13-15%    12.9%    13.1%    13.8%    14.1%    9.5%    9.8% 
 Efficiency ratio*    ~mid 50%'s  range    59.1%    58.1%    59.7%    56.7%    8.8%    11.8%

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Charter and Bylaws provide that the Board shall consist of not less than five nor more than twenty-five directors, excluding any directors elected by holders of preferred stock pursuant to provisions applicable only in the case of defaults under the terms of our preferred stock. The Board will fix the exact number of directors from time to time and has currently fixed the number at fourteen. The number of directors will be reduced to twelve following the retirement of Mr. Di Iorio and Mr. Ryan effective at the conclusion of the Annual Meeting. At each annual meeting, directors are elected to hold office for a term of one year expiring at the next annual meeting. 
The Board has nominated twelve of the fourteen directors currently serving on the Board for election at the Annual Meeting to serve until the 2020 annual meeting or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. If any nominee is unable to serve as a director, the Board may reduce, by resolution, the number of directors or choose a substitute nominee. We are not aware of any nominee who will be unable to or will not serve as a director. 
Our Bylaws provide for the election of directors by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. This means that the twelve individuals nominated for election to the Board must receive more "FOR" than "AGAINST" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) to be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose, and will have no effect on the election of nominees. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. There is no cumulative voting. If you sign and return the accompanying proxy card, your shares will be voted for the election of the twelve nominees recommended by the Board unless you choose to vote against any of the nominees or abstain from voting. If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve or will not serve, proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. If the election of directors is a contested election, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. 
Our Bylaws also provide that directors may be removed, with or without cause, by an affirmative vote of shares representing a majority of the outstanding shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Any vacancy occurring on our Board and any newly created directorship may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office. 
Biographical information about the nominees for director, including information about their qualifications to serve as a director, is set forth below.

BOARD GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT 
The following sections provide an overview of our board governance structure and processes. Among other topics, we describe how we select directors, how we consider the independence of our directors and key aspects of our Board operations. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Committee Charters and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which set forth a flexible framework within which our Board, assisted by Board committees, directs our affairs. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address, among other things, the composition and functions of the Board, director independence, Board and Board committee evaluations, compensation of directors, management succession and review, Board committees and selection of new directors. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the corporate governance section of our website at www.citizensbank.com/investor-relations. 
The charters for each of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, Risk and Executive Committees are also available on the corporate governance section of our website at www.citizensbank.com/investor-relations. 
Our Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"), which sets forth key guiding principles concerning ethical conduct and is applicable to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Code addresses, among other things, conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information and compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and describes the process by which any concerns about violations should be reported. 
The Code is available on the corporate governance section of our website at www.citizensbank.com/investor-relations. You may also obtain a copy, free of charge, by writing to our Corporate Secretary at 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901. Any amendments to the Code, or any waivers of its requirements, will be disclosed on our website. 
Board Composition 
When considering whether directors and director nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, our Board focuses primarily on each person's background and experience. This includes leadership, character, financial literacy, judgment, independence, diversity and key skills. We believe that our directors represent an appropriate and diverse mix of backgrounds, experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. 
The following key facts reflect the composition, skills and experience of the Board following the retirement of Mr. Di Iorio and Mr. Ryan effective at the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
Board Selection and Refreshment 
Our Board has delegated responsibility for the review and recommendation of director nominees to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Upon the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, a slate of directors is nominated by the Board and submitted to a stockholder vote annually. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also review and recommend candidates for the Board as vacancies or newly created positions occur.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
New candidates may be identified to serve on the board of directors through recommendations from independent directors or members of management, search firms or other sources, and stockholders. Evaluations of prospective candidates typically include a review of the candidate's background and qualifications by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, interviews with the committee as a whole, one or more members of the committee, or one or more other board members, and discussions within the committee and the full board of directors. 
In preparation for the retirements of Mr. Di Iorio and Mr. Ryan, the Board engaged a highly regarded leadership consulting firm, Spencer Stuart, to assist in identifying and evaluating potential new Board members. After a review of a range of highly qualified candidates by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee based on the criteria outlined above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee submitted their recommendations to the Board and Mr. Lillis and Mr. Kelly were appointed effective February 1, 2019. 
Any stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective candidate for the board of directors for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may do so by submitting the name and qualifications of the prospective candidate in writing to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901. Stockholders must propose nominees for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the procedures and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws. See "Information for Stockholders—2020 Annual Meeting and Stockholder Proposals." 
While all of our directors meet the requirements of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, in recommending the re-nomination of directors to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews, among other things, all outside directorships on a facts and circumstances basis to determine whether simultaneous service on other boards could impair a director's ability to effectively serve on our Board. Mr. Hankowsky is an active CEO and Chairman of a public company and sits on two additional public company boards, including ours. In considering  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
 Mr. Hankowsky's re-nomination, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed his (i) geographic proximity to and length of tenure on his other boards; (ii) locality to a key area of the Citizens footprint; (iii) real estate and financial services industry expertise; (iv) leadership and management experience; and (v) attendance, performance and contributions to our Board. Based upon its review, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that Mr. Hankowsky's outside directorships do not impair his effectiveness as a director and valuable member of our Board. 
Director Independence 
As a part of its listing standards, the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") has adopted certain criteria that determine director independence. As an NYSE-listed company, our Board utilizes these criteria to determine our director independence. Under the NYSE rules, the Board also broadly considers all other relevant facts and circumstances that bear on the materiality of each director's relationship with the Company, including the potential for conflicts of interest, when determining director independence. In addition, the Board considers whether the Company or one of its subsidiaries has a lending relationship, deposit relationship, or other banking or commercial relationship with a director, an immediate family member, or an entity with which the director or a family member is affiliated by reason of being a director, an officer or a significant stockholder thereof. Any such relationship must meet the following criteria: (i) it must be in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons; and (ii) with respect to extensions of credit by the Company or its subsidiaries to such entity: (a) such extensions of credit have been made in compliance with applicable law, including Federal Reserve Regulation O and Section 13(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (b) no event of default has occurred and is continuing beyond any period of cure. 
To assist the Board in its determination of director independence, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually evaluates each prospective and incumbent director using the foregoing standards and such other factors as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems appropriate, and makes a recommendation to the Board regarding the independence or non- independence of each such person. As a part of this evaluation process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances and, in particular, the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the NYSE. Banking relationships with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (including deposit, investment, lending, fiduciary) that are conducted in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms and conditions as are otherwise available to non-affiliated customers for comparable transactions are not considered material in determining independence. 
We have determined that each of Mr. Casady, Ms. Cumming, Mr. Di Iorio, Mr. Hankowsky, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Higdon, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Koch, Mr. Lillis, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Subramaniam, Ms. Watson and Ms. Zuraitis is an independent director within the meaning of the applicable rules of the SEC and NYSE. In addition, we have determined each Committee member meets the independence and expertise requirements within the meaning of the applicable rules of the SEC and NYSE for the Committees on which they serve. For further information see "Corporate Governance – Board Governance and Oversight – Committees of the Board." 
Board Leadership 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our Chief Executive Officer shall serve as Chairman of the Board, while an independent director shall serve as Lead Director. Given the significant duties designated to our independent Lead Director, the Board's view is that having a  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
 combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer enables it to (i) provide efficient and effective governance and leadership to the Company, (ii) be apprised of current risks and issues that may impact the Company in a timely manner, and (iii) present a single point of leadership to all Company stakeholders. Accordingly, the Board has determined that a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer position, with an independent Lead Director, is the most appropriate Board leadership structure for the Company. 
The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure in light of the composition of the Board, the needs of the Company and its stockholders, peer company practices, and other factors and retains the flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in any manner that serves the best interests of the Company. 
The Lead Director is an independent director designated by the Board, based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Key responsibilities of the Lead Director:

Meetings of the Board of Directors and Attendance at the Annual Meeting 
Our board of directors held ten meetings during fiscal 2018. No member attended fewer than 75% of the Board and committee meetings on which the member sits. All directors are expected to attend our annual meetings. Ten of our twelve directors serving during 2018 attended the annual meeting held April 26, 2018. The 2019 Annual Meeting is the Company's fifth annual meeting since becoming a public company during fiscal 2014. 
Executive Sessions of Our Non-Employee Directors 
The Company's non-employee directors, who are all independent, participate in regularly scheduled executive sessions in which management does not participate. Our Lead Director, currently Mr. Ryan, presides at each executive session. Interested persons may make their concerns known directly to Mr. Ryan, his successor or the non-employee directors as a group by submitting their written correspondence to the Company's Corporate Secretary located at 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901. The Corporate Secretary may facilitate such direct communication to

 the Lead Director or the non-employee directors as a group by reviewing, sorting and summarizing such communications. 
Board, Committee and Director Evaluations 
The Board, led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. Under each committee's charter, the committee evaluates and assesses its performance, skills and resources required to meet its obligations under its charter at least annually. In addition, all directors complete a self-evaluation. At least every three years, an independent party is used to conduct the Board and committee evaluations. 
Results of the evaluations are then presented to the Board and its committees and used to determine actions designed to enhance the operations of the Board and its committees going forward. Periodically, the Board will also complete peer evaluations. The results of all peer evaluations are reviewed by the Chair, Lead Director and Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In addition, each director receives a copy of their individual report. The following outlines our annual evaluation cycle:

[END TABLE]
Board Education 
Each of our Board members participates in an annual training and continuing education program which includes both full board training and board committee training. An annual schedule is developed, with input from the directors, which covers a broad range of topics to enhance and strengthen the skills, knowledge and competencies of directors, individually and collectively. Examples of such topics include cybersecurity, crisis management, regulatory developments, corporate governance, anti-money laundering and industry trends. The program encompasses presentations from internal and external speakers as well as site visits to key locations and regular meetings with management. In addition, directors are encouraged to avail themselves of educational programs offered through recognized independent providers. 
Board's Role in Strategy 
The Board is responsible for guiding and ultimately approving the strategic direction of the Company and overseeing execution of the Company's strategic plan. Every year the Board holds an offsite meeting dedicated to reviewing the Company's long-term strategy which includes detailed discussions with management, investors, securities analysts and industry experts. In addition, the Board assesses the Company's strategic, competitive and financial performance at each of its meetings to ensure continued alignment to the long-term strategy. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for oversight of the Company's internal controls and risk management framework. This oversight generally requires evaluation of management's systems of internal control, financial reporting and public disclosure, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of financial results, review and approval of the Company's enterprise-wide risk management governance framework and ensuring that risks to the Company are properly managed. The Board has delegated certain risk oversight duties to the Risk Committee and, with respect to financial controls, the Audit Committee. The Board receives independent reports from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee at each of its meetings. 
While each of the Audit and Risk Committees play a role in the oversight of risk, it is the Risk Committee which serves as the primary point of contact between the Board and the management-level committees that have responsibility for risk management. See "Corporate Governance—Board Governance and Oversight—Committees of the Board." 
Under its charter, the Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the design, implementation and operation of the Company's enterprise-wide risk management governance framework with respect to funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, strategic risk, business risk, reputation risk, operational risk, model risk and pension risk. The Risk Committee reviews and, as it deems appropriate, recommends to the Board the design and implementation of the Company's risk strategy and policy, risk appetite framework and specific risk appetites and limits. 
Under the oversight of the Risk Committee, the Company operates an enterprise-wide risk management framework which sets standards and provides guidance for the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of material risks that affect or have the potential to affect the value for our stockholders, customers and colleagues and the safety and soundness of the Company. The framework sets forth the risk governance model that operates within the Company and outlines the responsibilities of the Board and its committees, executive officers, colleagues and oversight committees with respect to risk governance, supervision and internal control systems.

Our cybersecurity program is overseen by both the Audit and Risk Committees. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our cybersecurity program under its risk oversight responsibilities as it relates to financial controls. The Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of management of cybersecurity risk consistent with the Company's enterprise-wide risk management governance framework. Both the Audit and Risk Committees receive regular reporting on cybersecurity and as cyber threats continue to evolve, under their oversight, we continually seek to enhance our layers of defense.
We remain committed to building and maintaining a strong risk management culture throughout the Company and believe having an ethical culture that extends through every layer of the Company is foundational to delivering the best possible banking experience for our customers and a great workplace for our colleagues. Our Conduct Office, overseen by the Audit Committee, has oversight responsibility for monitoring the behavior of our colleagues in relation to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Sales Practices and other key policy considerations on a Company-wide basis. 
Committees of the Board 
Our Board has six standing committees. Four of these committees (Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Risk) meet on a regular basis. The Executive Committee meets as needed and is composed of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Lead Director and the Chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Executive Committee may act on behalf of the Board and reports its actions to the full Board. The Equity Committee is composed of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and acts as needed to make equity grants (subject to certain limitations determined by the Compensation Committee) between annual grant cycles and reports its actions to the Compensation Committee. See "Compensation Matters—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Process for Approval of Equity Grants." In carrying out their duties, each committee of the Board is authorized to select, retain, terminate and approve fees and other retention terms of independent legal or other advisors as it deems appropriate without seeking approval of management or the Board. The following table shows the current members of each of the four primary standing committees and the number of meetings held during fiscal 2018.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of the Compensation Committee who served during 2018 are current or former officers or employees of the Company or any of our subsidiaries. No Company executive officer served on the compensation committee of another entity that employed an executive officer who also served on our Board. No Company executive officer served as a director of an entity that employed an executive officer who also served on our Compensation Committee. 
Talent Management and Succession Planning 
At least annually, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company's talent management and succession plan, including with respect to Chief Executive Officer and other executive positions. This includes the review and evaluation of development plans for potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer role and other key positions. 
Developing talent at all levels is a priority for the Company. We have two programs focused on providing the Board with additional opportunities to interact with senior management, which gives management unique access to the Board and also facilitates a deeper understanding of the organization by the Board. This includes a mentoring program that pairs executives with Board members and informal feedback sessions where directors meet with groups of senior management below the executive level. The Company also offers various talent development programs throughout the organization focused on building leadership and management skills, career development, and other areas.

STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Stockholder Outreach 
Throughout the year we interact and communicate with our stockholders in a number of forums, including quarterly earnings presentations, investor conferences, press releases and SEC filings, stockholder dialogue, our annual report, proxy statement and the annual meeting of stockholders. 
On an annual basis, we proactively reach out to our largest stockholders to solicit feedback on corporate governance and executive compensation in order to continue to look for opportunities to enhance our current practices. In 2018, six of our stockholders accepted our invitation to engage in discussions regarding our progress against our strategic plan, key elements of our executive compensation program and our corporate governance practices. We also held discussions with additional stockholders at their request. We were supportive of their feedback and used it to enhance certain practices, for example, we published a statement regarding our commitment to pay equity on our website. Obtaining investor feedback is important to us and feedback received was shared with the Board. 
Communications with the Board 
Stockholders who wish to contact our Board may send written correspondence, in care of the Corporate Secretary, to Citizens Financial Group, Inc., 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901. Communications may be addressed to the Lead Director or any alternate director, marked as confidential or otherwise. Communications which are addressed to the Board, an individual director or group of directors will be processed by the Office of the Corporate Secretary. Communications received that discuss business or other matters relevant to the activities of our Board, as determined by the Corporate Secretary, will be distributed to the addressees either in summary form or by delivering a copy of the communication. With respect to other correspondence received by the Company on behalf of one or more directors, the Board has requested that certain items, including the following, not be distributed to directors, because they generally fall into the purview of management, rather than the Board: junk mail and mass mailings, product and services complaints, product and services inquiries, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, solicitations for charitable donations, surveys, business solicitations and advertisements.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Our vision of being a top-performing regional bank is guided by our core values. We believe that good citizens help each other and that when communities prosper, we all thrive. We remain committed to contributing to the health of the community through our customers, colleagues and management of our environmental impact. In 2018 we published our first Corporate Responsibility Report which provides an overview of how we're putting these commitments to work in serving our customers well, providing our colleagues with a great place to work, strengthening our communities and reducing our environmental impact. Our Corporate Responsibility Report can be found on our website. 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
We have adopted a written related person transaction policy pursuant to which our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders, including their immediate family members, are not permitted to enter into a related person transaction with us without the consent of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Subject to certain transactions excluded from the policy, any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, significant stockholder or any of such persons' immediate family members, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, is required to be presented to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for review, consideration and approval. All of our directors, director nominees, executive officers and significant stockholders are required to report to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee any such related person transaction. In approving or rejecting the proposed transaction, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, the commercial reasonableness of the terms, the benefit or perceived benefit, or lack thereof, to the Company, opportunity costs of alternate transactions, the materiality and character of the related person's direct or indirect interest and the actual or perceived conflict of interest of the related person. 
Transactions with Executive Officers and Directors 
We provide credit facilities from time to time to certain directors and executive officers and their immediate families, as well as their affiliated companies. These credit facilities (i) complied with our Regulation O policies and procedures, (ii) were made in the ordinary course of business, (iii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender, and (iv) did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or did not present other features unfavorable to the Company. 
Under supplemental retirement arrangements relating to their prior service to Charter One, which we acquired in 2004, Mr. Charles Koch, a director, as well as his brother, Mr. John Koch, are entitled to receive monthly payments. Mr. Charles Koch and Mr. John Koch received approximately $877,500 and $744,900, respectively, under this arrangement during 2018. 
Indemnification Agreements 
We entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors or executive officers, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. 
There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors and executive officers for which indemnification is sought or which is adverse to the Company.

COMPENSATION MATTERS 
PROPOSAL 2 - ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Company provides this vote under the federal securities laws (Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and in recognition of our stockholders' vote in 2015 recommending that we hold a non-binding, advisory vote on executive compensation each year. Following that vote, the Board affirmed that recommendation and elected to hold future "say-on-pay" advisory votes on an annual basis, until the next stockholder vote on say-on-pay frequency.                 
With this item, stockholders may submit an advisory vote on the compensation of our CEO and other named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table. We encourage stockholders to review the complete description of our executive compensation programs provided in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the compensation tables and accompanying narrative, which describe the ways we seek to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. 
We ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting. 
RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's executive officers named in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and accompanying narrative). 
Although the vote on this proposal is advisory and, therefore non-binding, the Compensation Committee will carefully consider the results of this vote when making future compensation decisions. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Our NEOs for 2018 are named below:

Alignment of Pay and Performance 
Prior to our initial public offering in September 2014 and subsequent separation from The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, our performance had fallen behind peers given balance sheet shrinkage and underinvestment in strategic initiatives, technology and talent over a number of years. Over the past four years, we have addressed many of those challenges and have consistently demonstrated the ability to set a course, develop a plan and execute well, as demonstrated by our ability to meet or exceed analyst expectations for 18 consecutive quarters. Our performance journey is described in further detail in the section titled "Performance Highlights." 
We believe we have turned the corner on performance and are now aiming for excellence, on our way towards becoming a top-performing regional bank. We believe we have built a solid foundation with additional levers available to us for continued performance improvement. 
To realize these results, it has been essential for us to effectively attract, retain, and motivate highly capable and experienced executive management and we feel our compensation program has been integral in achieving this goal. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy & Principles 
The fundamental principles that guide the design and implementation of compensation programs for our NEOs include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Attract, retain, motivate and reward high-caliber executives to deliver long-term business performance. 
       Provide alignment between annual and long-term compensation for executives and the Company's strategic plan. 
       Support a culture where employees recognize the importance of serving customers well and are rewarded for superior performance. 
       Encourage the creation of value over the long-term and align the rewards received by executives with returns to stockholders. 
       Design compensation in a manner that promotes a culture of risk management and accountability.

Review of Compensation Program 
Over 95% of the votes cast on the advisory say-on-pay vote conducted at our 2018 annual meeting approved the compensation of our NEOs. Notwithstanding our say-on-pay results in any given year, throughout the year the Compensation Committee's consultant provides updates regarding executive compensation trends, best practices, and regulatory developments in order to assist the Compensation Committee in determining whether any changes to our executive compensation program should be considered. No significant changes were made to our executive compensation program in 2018. 
Highlights of our Pay Practices 
We believe our pay practices demonstrate our commitment to alignment with stockholders' interests and our dedication to maintaining a compensation program supported by strong corporate governance, as exemplified by the following practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Pay for performance.    A significant portion of our executives' compensation is awarded in the form of awards that are earned based on Company performance.             No single trigger vesting of equity awards or cash payments.    We do not provide for any single trigger vesting of equity awards or severance  payments upon a change of control, unless there is a qualifying termination of employment.

Prohibition against hedging and pledging.    We prohibit executive officers, employees, and directors from hedging or pledging Company  securities.

Prohibition against hedging and pledging.    We prohibit executive officers, employees, and directors from hedging or pledging Company  securities. 
         Pay is subject to clawback.    In addition to clawback required by law, we have a broad-based process through which events having a material adverse impact on the Company are reviewed for potential impact  on compensation.             No tax gross-ups.    We do not offer tax gross-ups on executive  benefits other than in connection with our relocation program, which provides a gross-up to all employees receiving this benefit. In addition, we do not provide for excise tax  gross-ups upon a change of control.

Dividend equivalents are not paid on unvested units.    Dividend equivalents are accrued but not paid until  restricted stock units and performance stock units become vested.

Executive Compensation Governance 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is composed solely of independent directors and is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring the administration of our executive compensation plans and programs, and approving our executives' compensation. Among its duties, the Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of our CEO and, based upon recommendations from the CEO (together with our Chief Human Resources Officer), approving compensation for our other executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee is generally responsible for overseeing our material compensation and benefit plans, recommending to the Board non-employee director compensation, evaluating executive performance, and reviewing talent management and succession plans. 
Role of Compensation Consultants 
Compensation Advisory Partners, LLC 
The Compensation Committee retained Compensation Advisory Partners, LLC ("CAP") to provide guidance and advice on compensation-related matters during 2018. CAP was directly selected and retained by the Compensation Committee to provide a broad set of services pertaining to the compensation of our executives and our directors. The Compensation Committee does not engage CAP for any additional services outside of executive and director compensation consulting. In  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 connection with CAP's retention and on an annual basis, the Compensation Committee conducts an assessment of potential conflicts of interest, considering various factors including the six factors mandated by the New York Stock Exchange rules, and no conflicts of interest relating to its services have been identified. 
McLagan, AON Hewitt ("McLagan") 
Our management retains McLagan to provide market compensation data, which is referenced by the Compensation Committee when making executive compensation decisions. In addition to our internal review of incentive plans, management engaged McLagan to conduct an independent risk review of our incentive compensation plans during 2018. The Company engages an independent third party to conduct this type of analysis at least once every three years. 
Role of Management 
Our CEO reviews the performance of each of the other executives, including the NEOs, annually. Following this review, the CEO (together with our Chief Human Resources Officer) makes salary and variable compensation recommendations for executives to the Compensation Committee for review, feedback, and approval. Neither our CEO nor our Chief Human Resources Officer has any role in determining his or her own compensation. 
Compensation Peer Group 
As part of its decision-making process, the Compensation Committee refers to a peer group of companies for comparisons of compensation and performance. Although the Compensation Committee refers to peer group data in making compensation decisions, it does not target a specific percentile for executive compensation. In determining how to position our compensation relative to peers, the Compensation Committee focuses on how well the Company has performed relative to internal targets and performance improvement relative to peers. 
The Compensation Committee's compensation consultant leads a review of the Company's compensation peer group on an annual basis, with the Compensation Committee making any adjustments based on the advice of management and its compensation consultant. During its annual review of the peer group, the Compensation Committee considers the size, complexity, and business mix of potential peers, and also considers the banks with which the Company competes for talent. At the time of our 2018 peer group review, the median annual assets of these companies was $140.7 billion (as of the second quarter of 2018), which was comparable to our asset size of $155.4 billion. 
The Compensation Committee determined in 2018 that continued use of the following peer group, which is also consistent with our financial peer group, remained appropriate for its reference in making 2018 performance year compensation decisions:

Role of Risk Management in Executive Compensation 
The Company acknowledges that there are inherent risks associated with executive compensation and has taken a multi-faceted approach to manage those risks, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Executives are prohibited from hedging and pledging Company securities. 
   Our Compensation Committee engages an independent third party to conduct a risk assessment of our  incentive compensation plans every three years. 
   Equity compensation awards are subject to potential forfeiture or clawback in connection with our  Accountability Review Panel process, including as a result of risk-related events. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Executives are awarded a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of long-term equity  awards. 
   Between 50%-70% of long-term awards for executives are awarded in  the form of performance stock units that vest following a three-year performance period depending on achievement against pre-established performance criteria. 
   Equity compensation awards do not accelerate in the event of retirement or change of  control. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Chief Risk Officer conducts an annual review of executives risk performance. 
   Inputs to this review include a risk performance questionnaire designed by the Chief Risk Officer and  completed by Risk partners who have worked closely with the executive, audit results, and executives self-evaluations against risk objectives. 
   The resulting risk score is taken into consideration by the Compensation Committee in determining  executives compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Decisions 
Base Salary 
The base salaries of our executives, including those of our NEOs, are reviewed by the Compensation Committee annually. Executives' salaries are subject to change at the Compensation Committee's discretion if, among other reasons, the executives' responsibilities change materially or there are significant changes in the competitive market environment. No modifications have been made to our NEOs' salaries for 2019, as the Compensation Committee determined each of their salaries is at a level appropriate for their role. For the amounts of our NEOs' base salaries earned during 2018, see the "Salary" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below, along with accompanying footnotes.

Variable Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee members believe it is important for them to retain discretion to determine overall variable compensation funding as well as individual executive awards, in order to ensure that we continue to build stockholder value while promoting the stability and growth of the Company. 
The Compensation Committee exercises structured discretion in making these determinations, with decisions informed by a number of qualitative and quantitative performance metrics across various dimensions. The factors considered by the Compensation Committee represent both objective and subjective considerations, and the Compensation Committee does not favor one measure over another or apply a particular formula or weighting. 
The Compensation Committee believes that reviewing multiple dimensions of performance in determining pay facilitates management's focus on Company performance overall and mitigates the risk of disproportionate focus on certain elements of performance to the detriment of others. 
Process for Determining Overall Funding 
The determination of our overall variable compensation funding is informed by a robust process that includes a comprehensive review of Company performance through multiple dimensions. These dimensions include key financial performance measures, risk performance, delivery to stakeholders (customers, employees, stockholders, regulators, and community), progress on strategic initiatives, performance relative to peer companies (including relative performance improvement), and the amount of the pool as a percentage of our pre-tax, pre-incentive operating profit. 
At the end of 2018, performance against each of these dimensions was reviewed by the Compensation Committee, as well as the potential impact of various pool allocation scenarios on the employee population. Following the consideration of all of these factors, the Compensation Committee determined the overall variable compensation pool. 
Determining NEO Variable Compensation Awards 
After the overall variable compensation pool was established, the Compensation Committee determined the variable compensation amounts for each of our NEOs based on its review of each executive's performance. In making these determinations, the Compensation Committee evaluated executive performance through the use of a balanced scorecard reflecting the following dimensions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Financial and overall business performance (for example, financial performance as compared to our budget/strategic  plan as well as improvement relative to peers)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Risk and control (for example, delivery against regulatory expectations and control environment)   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Customer outcomes (for example, measures reflecting customer satisfaction and deepening customer relationships)   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  Strategic initiatives (for example, successful execution of M&A and cost saving initiatives)   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  Human capital (for example, talent development, turnover and organizational health metrics)  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that this approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the Company's overall results and the individual executive's contributions to those results. These dimensions reflect a balanced review of performance, providing a means for applying structured discretion in assessing results and determining pay.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
Executives, including the NEOs (other than the Chief Risk Officer, whose performance is evaluated by the Risk Committee), are also subject to an annual risk assessment by our Chief Risk Officer, the results of which are considered by the Compensation Committee when evaluating executive performance and making compensation decisions. 
Executive compensation levels at our peer companies were also considered by the Compensation Committee in making compensation decisions based on most recently available data (McLagan 2018 survey data reflecting 2017 compensation). Our peer firms for this purpose are identified above in "—Executive Compensation Governance—Compensation Peer Group." The Compensation Committee also considered the target compensation amount for Mr. Van Saun in determining his variable compensation, although the target is intended to serve only as a reference point, with the primary drivers of the compensation decision being performance across the five dimensions discussed above. Mr. Van Saun's target total compensation is $9.0 million (which was increased from $8.1 million in December 2018 in light of the increase to median CEO compensation in our peer group). 
The Compensation Committee determined that the 2018 variable compensation amounts reflected below in the 2018 Performance Year Compensation Supplemental Table for our NEOs were appropriate, in large part, due to 2018 Company performance described earlier in "Performance Highlights" and the following key individual achievements during 2018:

Variable Compensation Mix 
Each year, the Compensation Committee determines the appropriate mix of executive variable compensation. For performance year 2018, the following variable compensation mixes were approved for our NEOs. The Compensation Committee believes that these variable compensation mixes are appropriate as they result in a meaningful portion of executives' compensation being awarded in the form of long-term equity awards (60%-70%), which ensures alignment with stockholders' interests without the rigidity of formulaic compensation. 
Under the SEC reporting rules, the cash portion of our NEOs' variable compensation for the 2018 performance year is reflected in the "Bonus" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table. In addition, the performance stock units and restricted stock units granted in 2018 relating to performance year 2017 are reflected in the "Stock Awards" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table. However, the performance stock units and restricted stock units granted in 2019 for performance year 2018 will be reflected in the "Stock Awards" column of our 2019 Summary Compensation Table. 
Restricted stock units granted in 2018 for performance year 2017 are scheduled to become vested in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.  
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
PSUs Granted in 2018 
Performance stock units granted in 2018 for performance year 2017 ("2018 PSU Awards") have a three-year performance period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 and are scheduled to become vested on March 1, 2021. Half of each 2018 PSU Award will be earned based on achievement of targeted cumulative diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") and half will be earned based on achievement of targeted average return on average tangible common equity ("ROTCE"), with a maximum payout of 150% of target. 
The Compensation Committee believes that Diluted EPS and ROTCE continue to be appropriate measures for the Company's PSU Awards because improvement in these metrics is an integral element of the Company's strategic plan, with growth in Diluted EPS and in ROTCE being essential for us to continue on our trajectory to becoming a top performing regional bank. Targets for Diluted EPS and ROTCE for 2018 PSU Awards have been set by the Compensation Committee, together with management, in connection with our strategic planning process. As part of the strategic planning process, our Board considers prior year performance as a baseline and formulates a three-year strategic plan informed by historic performance, market conditions, and the competitive landscape. Due to the comprehensive nature of our strategic plan, achievement of our strategic plan targets would represent payout at a level of 100-125% of target under our 2018 PSU Awards. Under the terms of the awards, the Compensation Committee retains the ability to exercise some negative discretion to reduce the number of shares earned based on achievement of Diluted EPS and ROTCE targets at the end of the performance period. 
We define "ROTCE" as net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liabilities) and average other intangible assets, as reported on an underlying or adjusted basis consistent with our external earnings reporting. We define "Diluted EPS" as net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, also as reported on an underlying or adjusted basis consistent with our external earnings reporting. "Underlying" or "Adjusted" results exclude certain items, as applicable, that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of on-going financial performance. 
Performance Assessment of PSUs Granted in 2016 
General 2016 PSU Award 
The Compensation Committee assessed the performance level of performance stock units granted in 2016 relating to the 2015 performance year ("2016 PSU Awards") at its meeting held on February 13,  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 2019. The last performance assessment of PSU awards by the Compensation Committee was in 2017, when the PSUs granted in 2015 were assessed at 74% of target. 
Half of each 2016 PSU Award has been earned based on achievement of targeted Diluted EPS and half has been earned based on achievement of targeted ROTCE, with an overall maximum payout of 150% of target. 2016 PSU Awards were earned based on performance during the 2016-2018 three-year performance period compared to pre-established performance criteria, which were established in connection with our strategic planning process. The ROTCE target for this award represents 4% growth in average ROTCE for the period and maximum represents 14% growth in average ROTCE relative to 2015. The Diluted EPS target for this award represents 11% growth in 2016 and then flat performance in 2017 and 2018, while the maximum represents a compound annual growth rate of 9% per annum over the period. 
During the performance period of 2016-2018, the average ROTCE for the period was 9.60% (43% improvement over the period) and Diluted EPS for the period was $7.61 (a compound annual growth rate of 17% over the period), which both delivered maximum payout. 
CEO 2016 Special PSU Award 
The Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Van Saun in May 2016 following the Company's full separation from the Royal Bank of Scotland plc, which among other terms, eliminated the annual fixed cash pension benefit allowance of ~$550,000 provided under Mr. Van Saun's prior contract. As consideration for that change, Mr. Van Saun was granted a special equity award with a target grant date value of $3 million. Half of this special equity award was granted in the form of restricted stock units and half in performance stock units with a three-year performance period ("Special PSU Award"). In addition to providing consideration for the elimination of Mr. Van Saun's annual fixed cash pension benefit allowance, the Compensation Committee determined that making this one-time award to Mr. Van Saun would provide additional retentive value in a form that further aligns his incentives with stockholders' interests and the strategic objectives of the business. 
At its February 13, 2019 meeting, the Compensation Committee assessed the Special PSU Award at a level of 125% of target, in light of the Company's strong performance during the performance period (2016-2018) across the performance dimensions described below. This award will vest on May 5, 2019 at this level of achievement, subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement.

[END TABLE]
Pension Plan 
The CFG Pension Plan, a tax-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009 and frozen to all participants and benefit accruals effective December 31, 2012. Mr. Conner had a benefit under this plan as of December 31, 2018 because he was hired prior to 2009. For a description of the material terms of the CFG Pension Plan, see the narrative following the 2018 Pension Benefits Table. 
401(k) Plan 
We maintain a qualified defined contribution 401(k) plan for all of our employees. Employees may defer up to 50% of their eligible pay to the plan up to Internal Revenue Code limits. After employees have completed one full year of service, employee contributions are matched at 100% up to an overall limit of 4% and employees receive an additional Company contribution equal to 2% of earnings, subject to limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. Our NEOs are entitled to participate in our 401(k) plan on the same basis as our employees generally. 
Health and Welfare Benefit Plans 
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in Company-sponsored benefit programs, offered on the same terms and conditions as those made generally available to our employees, including medical, dental, vision, and short-term and long-term disability plans. 
Perquisites and Other Benefits 
We provide our executives, including our NEOs, with independent advisors to assist them with financial planning, if desired by the executives. Our executives, including our NEOs, are also covered by relocation and matching charitable contribution programs that generally cover our employees. In addition, our Company car was used by Mr. Van Saun for limited personal use. For additional details, see footnote 7 to the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below. 
Clawback Process 
The Company has a firm-wide accountability review process to ensure that there is a standardized process to take appropriate action in instances where new information would have changed compensation decisions made in previous years or should be considered in making compensation decisions for the current year. As part of that process, the Accountability Review Panel ("ARP") meets on a regular basis to consider events having a material adverse impact on the Company to determine whether compensation adjustments are appropriate for involved employees. Potential actions by the ARP include current-year compensation adjustment, forfeiture of unvested awards, or clawback. 
Our CEO and CFO are also subject to clawback as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Compensation Committee monitors regulatory developments relating to clawback and will continue to evaluate our practices in order to ensure they drive appropriate behavior and discourage inappropriate risk taking, as well as comply with law. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
The Company maintains stock ownership and retention guidelines in order to further align the long-term interests of our executives and non-employee directors with those of our stockholders.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
Our stock ownership guidelines require that our executives and non-employee directors hold shares having an aggregate value equal to a multiple of executives' annual base salary or non-employee directors' annual cash retainer, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer   5x Annual Base Salary 
 Other Executives   3x Annual Base Salary 
 Non-Employee Directors   4x Annual Cash Board Retainer 
[END TABLE]
Shares that count for purposes of ownership under the guidelines include (i) shares or units for which receipt has been deferred (including shares held through our 401(k) plan, shares purchased under our tax-qualified employee share purchase program, unvested restricted stock units, and shares or units held through a deferred compensation plan maintained by the Company) and (ii) restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units (that may only be settled in shares) that are subject to time-based vesting conditions only. Unexercised options (whether vested or unvested), performance awards (including performance-based restricted stock and performance-based units), and unvested restricted stock units that may only be settled in cash would not count towards the satisfaction of these guidelines. 
Each executive or non-employee director has five years from the date he or she becomes subject to these guidelines to achieve compliance. Executives are also required to hold 50% of the net shares acquired as a result of settlement of compensatory awards granted in 2016 and onward until ownership guidelines have been met. Directors' restricted stock unit awards are not settled until their cessation from service on the Board. 
Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging 
We prohibit our employees and directors, including our NEOs and other officers, from engaging in any hedging transactions (including transactions involving options, puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds or other derivatives) that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in the market value of the Company's equity securities or pledging their ownership in our securities (including equity-based awards), which would undermine the risk alignment embedded in our equity-based compensation arrangements. 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"), a public company generally may not deduct compensation in excess of $1 million paid to its CEO and other covered officers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") made certain changes to Section 162(m), most notably repealing the exemption for qualified performance-based compensation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and expanding the scope of persons covered by its limitations on deductibility. Accordingly, compensation paid after 2017 to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. We have historically sought to structure our variable equity-based and cash-based incentive awards to be deductible under Section 162(m), to the extent possible. However, to maintain flexibility we do not have a policy requiring compensation to be fully deductible under Section 162(m). While the Company plans to rely on the transition relief included in the TCJA to the extent practicable, the Company believes that tax deductibility of compensation should not be the sole or primary factor in setting executive compensation policy or in rewarding executive performance.

  (3)  2018 amounts in this column reflect the cash portion of annual variable compensation awards for the 2018 performance year.  The cash portion of annual variable compensation awards for prior years are reported in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of this table.  
[END TABLE]
For Mr. Griggs, this amount also includes $54,368 related to the 2018 vesting and payout of the last installment of a cash buy-out award granted to him in connection with the commencement of his employment in 2014. 
Mr. Van Saun elected to defer 80% of the cash portion of his 2018 variable compensation ($1,971,120 out of $2,463,900) pursuant to the CFG Voluntary Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which is discussed in more detail in the narrative following the 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  Amounts in this column for 2018 reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock unit and performance stock  unit awards granted in March 2018 as part of 2017 performance year compensation.

      For the performance stock unit awards, the amounts above were calculated based on the probable outcome of the performance  conditions as of the service inception date and represent the value of the target number of units granted, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the service inception  date under FASB ASC 718. As of the service inception date, the values of the performance stock unit awards granted to the NEOs in 2018 assuming the highest level of performance (150% of the grant date value), were as follows: Mr. Van Saun  ($5,634,697); Mr. Woods ($2,024,972); Mr. McCree ($2,381,222); Mr. Conner ($1,743,681); and Mr. Griggs ($659,218).

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (6)  The actuarial present value of Mr. Conner's accumulated benefit under our pension plan decreased by $9,085  during 2018. As a result, consistent with SEC rules, a zero is reflected in this column for 2018. The $9,085 decrease includes a decrease of $13,194 due to changes in assumptions underlying the present value calculations and an increase of $4,109  due to the effect of Mr. Conner being one year closer to his assumed retirement age. See footnote 3 to the 2018 Pension Benefits Table for more details on the assumptions used to determine the present value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (7)  The below table reflects 2018 amounts included as "All Other Compensation" for each NEO. Amounts reflected in  the "Other" column below include the following: (i) incremental cost relating to personal use of car and driver for Mr. Van Saun, calculated based on variable vehicle costs (maintenance, fuel, tolls), variable driver costs  (overtime and bonus), and the percentage of miles driven for personal versus business use; and (ii) cost of financial planning services for Messrs. Van Saun, Woods, and Conner.

(1)  Mr. Conner is the only NEO eligible to participate in the CFG Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  After December 31, 2012, there were no further benefit accruals under the CFG Pension Plan. Therefore, an eligible  employee's actual years of service may be more than such employee's years of credited service under the CFG Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]

(3)  For Mr. Conner, the present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2018 was calculated using the same  actuarial assumptions used by the Company for GAAP financial reporting purposes, except where different assumptions are required. The following are the key assumptions used: (i) a discount rate of 4.33%; (ii) a retirement age of 65, as required  (the earliest unreduced retirement age under the CFG Pension Plan); (iii) the mortality assumption reflects generational mortality improvement using Scale MP-2018 for males; and (iv) no pre-retirement decrements, as required.

2018 Pension Benefits 
We sponsor the CFG Pension Plan (formerly RBS Americas Pension Plan) ("Pension Plan"), which is a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Pension Plan was closed to new hires and re-hires effective January 1, 2009 and frozen to all participants and benefit accruals effective December 31, 2012. Regular full-time and part-time employees of the Company who were hired before January 1, 2009 and completed one year of service were eligible for benefits under the Pension Plan.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
The benefit under the Pension Plan for employees is currently calculated using a formula based on an employee's "average gross compensation" (defined under the Pension Plan as a participant's average eligible compensation during five years of employment (whether or not consecutive) prior to December 31, 2012 yielding the highest average), subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Eligible compensation generally includes all taxable compensation, other than certain equity-based and non-recurring amounts. The formula generally provides for a benefit of 1% of average gross compensation multiplied by each year of the participant's credited service, with such benefit percentage varying depending on the employee's hire date and retirement date, as specified under the Pension Plan. Benefits under the Pension Plan are generally payable in the form of a monthly annuity, though benefits under the Pension Plan may be received as a lump sum payment. 
A participant's pension benefit under the Pension Plan generally vests in full on the "normal retirement date," when the participant reaches age 65 or the fifth anniversary of the date the participant commenced participation in the Plan, whichever is later. A participant's pension benefit under the Pension Plan also vests in full upon completion of five years of vesting service. Participants may begin receiving full retirement benefits on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the normal retirement date and may be eligible for reduced benefits if retiring after attainment of age 55 with a minimum of five years of vesting service. Participants who retire after attainment of age 62 with a minimum of twenty years of vesting service are eligible to receive unreduced retirement benefits. Mr. Conner became a participant in the Pension Plan on July 1, 2009. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Conner is eligible for early retirement under the Pension Plan and, based on his age at date of hire, will never be eligible for unreduced retirement benefits at age 62.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  For Mr. Van Saun, the amount in this column reflects the earnings (losses) on his deferred compensation plan account  during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Amounts in this column reflect the value of deferred cash awards that were paid as part of variable compensation for the  2014 performance year and which were previously disclosed in the "Non-Equity Incentive Compensation" column of the 2014 Summary Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
We sponsor the CFG Voluntary Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which does not offer any matching contributions or provide for above-market earnings. During 2018, Mr. Van Saun participated in the CFG Voluntary Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and elected to defer 10% of his base salary and 80% of the cash portion of his variable compensation award for the 2018 performance year. 
Under the CFG Voluntary Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, eligibility is limited to employees who have total compensation in the immediately preceding year equal to or exceeding the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) limit for the relevant plan year. Participants are permitted to defer between 1% and 80% of their base salary and annual bonus. Participants select the allocation of their accounts among investment indices available under the plan. Our Board has the power to amend the plan at any time, as long as the amount accrued to the date of amendment in any account under the plan is not decreased or otherwise restricted. In addition, following a termination of employment, participants in the CFG Executive Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan are entitled to receive amounts that have been deferred under that plan. 
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL 
We have entered into an employment agreement with each of our NEOs, the material terms of which are summarized below, including severance provisions. In addition, the treatment of equity-based awards held by our NEOs upon a termination of employment and change of control are summarized below. Please see the Potential Payments Table below for quantification of estimated payments and benefits to which our NEOs would be entitled under various termination scenarios and upon a change of control, in each case, assuming such event occurred on December 31, 2018. 
Equity Awards 
Equity awards under the Omnibus Plan granted to our NEOs have the following treatment upon termination of employment. Provisions relating to the treatment of Bruce Van Saun's equity-based awards upon termination of employment (including following a change of control of the Company) are included below in the description of his employment agreement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination  
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Units - If a participant's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without "cause" (as defined in the award agreements under the Omnibus Plan), or by reason of "disability" or "retirement" (as defined in award agreements under the Omnibus  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 Plan), vesting and settlement of awards will continue as originally scheduled subject to the participant not engaging in "detrimental activity" (as defined in award agreements under the Omnibus Plan), or competitive activity in the case of disability or retirement, during the remaining vesting period. If a participant voluntarily resigns or is terminated by the Company for cause, unvested awards will be forfeited. All unvested awards will become vested on the date of a participant's death. 
Performance Stock Units - In the event of a participant's voluntary resignation, all unvested awards would be forfeited. In the event of an involuntary termination by the Company of the grantee without cause, awards will continue to vest in accordance with the original schedule subject to actual performance and will not be pro-rated based on service, provided the termination does not occur prior to the first anniversary of the performance period start date and the participant does not engage in "detrimental activity"; if the termination occurs prior to the first year anniversary of the performance period start date, awards will be forfeited. In the event of a termination by reason of "disability" or "retirement" (as each is defined in the Omnibus Plan), awards will continue to vest in accordance with the original schedule subject to actual performance and will not be pro-rated based on service, provided the participant does not engage in "detrimental activity" or "competitive activity." In the event of a participant's death, awards will become vested at target and will not be subject to pro-ration based on service. In the event of a termination for cause, awards will be forfeited. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change of Control  
[END TABLE]
Omnibus Plan Provisions 
In the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the Omnibus Plan and summarized below), except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, the Compensation Committee may provide for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continuation or assumption of outstanding awards under the Omnibus Plan by the Company (if we are the surviving  corporation) or by the surviving corporation or its parent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms and value as such  outstanding awards under the Omnibus Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• acceleration of the vesting (including the lapse of any restrictions, with any performance criteria or conditions deemed  met at target) or the right to exercise outstanding awards immediately prior to the date of the change of control and the expiration of awards not timely exercised by the date determined by the Compensation Committee; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the case of outstanding stock options and SARs, cancelation in consideration of a payment in cash or other consideration  equal to the intrinsic value of the award. The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate without the payment of any consideration, any stock options or SARs for which the exercise or hurdle price is equal to or exceeds the per  share value of the consideration to be paid in the change of control transaction.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Omnibus Plan, except as otherwise provided in a participant's award agreement, "change of control" generally means the occurrence of one or more of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding securities (other than by an employee  benefit plan or trust maintained by us);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the replacement of the majority of our directors during any 12-month period;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of our merger or consolidation with another entity (unless our voting securities outstanding immediately  before such transaction continue to represent at least 50% of the combined voting power and total fair market value of the securities of the surviving entity, or if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof, outstanding immediately after such  transaction); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the transfer of our assets having an aggregate fair market value of more than 50% of the fair market value of the company  and our subsidiaries immediately before such transfer, but only to the extent that in connection with such transfer or within a reasonable period thereafter, our stockholders receive distributions of cash and/or assets having a fair market value  that is greater than 50% of the fair market value of us and our subsidiaries immediately before such transfer.  
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Stock Unit Agreements 
In the event of a change of control, the actual number of performance stock units earned will be determined and will remain subject to time-based vesting conditions until the end of the original vesting period. If within 12 months following a change of control, the participant's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" (as defined in award agreements under the Omnibus Plan) or the participant resigns for "good reason" (as defined in the award agreements under the Omnibus Plan), restricted stock units and performance stock units will fully vest and be settled immediately following the termination, with the level of performance for performance stock units measured as of the change of control. 
Severance 
The severance to which our NEOs are entitled in various circumstances is governed by their employment agreements, which are described below in "—Employment Agreements with Our NEOs." None of our NEOs' employment agreements provides for excise tax gross-ups in connection with a change of control. 
In addition to severance pay, under our severance practice our NEOs would also be entitled to receive benefits under our then-existing health and welfare plans for one month at active employee rates, prior to the start of the COBRA continuation period. Outplacement services would also be offered for 12 months. We may amend or terminate this practice at any time. 
Employment Agreements with Our NEOs 
The material terms of the agreements entered into with our NEOs are summarized below. 
Employment Agreement with Mr. Van Saun 
In light of UK and European remuneration regulations ceasing to apply to the Company in late 2015, we entered into an amended employment agreement with Mr. Van Saun on May 5, 2016. The Compensation Committee's objective was to put into place an arrangement that balanced its former obligations under Mr. Van Saun's prior agreement and achieved the following positive results for the Company: (i) motivates and rewards Mr. Van Saun for the achievement of our strategic objectives; (ii) provides additional retentive value; and (iii) aligns terms and conditions more closely with US market practice. 
The agreement has an initial five-year term that will be extended automatically for a subsequent two-year term unless either party provides at least 12 months notice to terminate. There is no  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 further opportunity for automatic renewal beyond the additional two-year term. In the event of Mr. Van Saun's voluntary resignation, he would be required to provide the Company at least six months notice in order to effectuate an orderly handover of duties. 
Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Van Saun is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $1,487,000 and has a target total compensation opportunity of $9.0 million, which was increased from $8.1 million in December 2018 in light of the subsequent increases to median CEO compensation in our peer group. The form and terms of Mr. Van Saun's variable compensation are to be determined annually by the Compensation Committee. In addition, Mr. Van Saun is eligible to participate in employee benefits available to the Company's senior executives generally and is also entitled to the business use of a company car. 
The agreement also provided Mr. Van Saun with a one-time equity award with a target value of $3 million, as consideration for the elimination of the annual fixed cash pension benefit allowance of ~$550,000 provided under his prior contract. Half of this special equity award was granted in the form of restricted stock units and half in performance stock units with a three year performance period ("Special PSU Award"). In addition to providing consideration for the elimination of Mr. Van Saun's annual fixed cash pension benefit allowance, the Compensation Committee determined that making this one-time award to Mr. Van Saun would provide additional retentive value in a form that further aligns him with stockholders and the strategic objectives of the business. The Special PSU Award was assessed by the Compensation Committee at its February 13, 2019 meeting, as discussed earlier in "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Decisions—Variable Compensation—Performance Assessment of PSUs Granted in 2016—CEO 2016 Special PSU Award." This award will vest on May 5, 2019 at this level of achievement, subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement. 
Under the terms of his agreement, Mr. Van Saun is also entitled to the following payments and benefits upon termination of employment in various scenarios, in each case, subject to execution and non-revocation of a release in our favor:  
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Van Saun is subject to a perpetual confidentiality covenant. In addition, Mr. Van Saun is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. The non-competition covenant applies for six months post-termination, concurrent with any notice period, in the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason. For this purpose, competitors are defined to include the following companies: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, Regions Financial Corp., M&T Bank Corp., PNC, Fifth Third, Sun Trust, Comerica, KeyCorp, BB&T, Capital One and TD Bank. The non-solicitation covenant prohibits solicitation of employees as well as customers and prospective clients for twelve months post-termination, concurrent with any notice period, in the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason. 
The agreement includes the following definitions of cause and good reason: 
"Cause" includes: (i) any indictment for, conviction of, plea of guilty or nolo contendere to by Mr. Van Saun for the commission of: (a) any felony, (b) any criminal offense within the scope of Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S. C. § 1829; or (c) a misdemeanor involving dishonesty; (ii) if Mr. Van Saun willfully commits a material breach of his obligations under his employment agreement or repeats or continues after written warning any material breach of his obligations under his employment agreement, or is, in the opinion of the board, guilty of gross misconduct which brings him or the company or any of its affiliates into disrepute; (iii) if Mr. Van Saun is guilty of dishonesty in the conduct of his duties under his employment agreement, gross incompetence, willful neglect of duty, or of mismanagement of his financial affairs through failure to observe the company's rules and procedures for the operation of bank accounts and/or borrowing; (iv) if Mr. Van Saun commits any act of bankruptcy or takes advantage of any statute for the time being in force offering relief to insolvent debtors; or (v) if, as a result of any default on the part of Mr. Van Saun, he is prohibited by law from acting as an officer of the company or any of its affiliates. 
"Good Reason" includes a material breach of the employment agreement by the company, or a substantial diminution or other substantial adverse change, not consented to by Mr. Van Saun, in the nature or scope of his responsibilities, authorities, powers, functions or duties or in his base salary, except that removal of the role of chairman of the company from his duties shall not amount to good reason. 
Employment Agreements with Other Active NEOs 
Each of Messrs. Woods, McCree, Conner and Griggs has entered into an employment agreement with the Company. These agreements generally provide for the terms of each executive's compensation arrangement, including salary and variable compensation, vacation and eligibility for other health and welfare benefits. Under each executive's agreement, the executive is subject to a notice period with regard to his intent to leave our employ for any reason (120 days for Messrs. Woods, McCree and Conner and 90 days for Mr. Griggs). In addition, each of the agreements contains covenants regarding the non-solicitation of customers and employees that apply for 12 months following a termination of employment for any reason. 
The agreements each provide that the executive is entitled to a minimum payment of 26 weeks of base salary in the event he is made redundant or is terminated by the Company without "cause" (as defined in the agreements), subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release in favor of the Company. This level of severance is consistent with severance available to all executives. In addition, the agreements each provide for double trigger severance in the event of a qualifying termination following a change of control. The decision to provide this severance was made in 2017  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – COMPENSATION MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 following a review of peer practice and to achieve parity among members of senior management. In the event of a termination by the Company without "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or resignation by the executive with "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) within 24 months following a change of control, each of Messrs. Woods, McCree, Conner and Griggs will receive severance consisting of: (i) two times the sum of his current base salary and average cash bonus received during the prior three years, plus (ii) a pro-rata cash bonus for the year in which termination occurs, also based on the average cash bonus during the prior three years. 
The agreements in place for Messrs. Woods and McCree also provide that, for purposes of calculating retirement eligibility under the Company's various plans, each executive will be credited with an additional five years of service. Pursuant to Mr. Woods' agreement, his target variable compensation is $2.7 million and he was granted a $7 million buy-out award in order to compensate him for the bonus which would have otherwise been paid to him by his former employer for the 2016 year and the value of awards he forfeited in connection with his resignation. Of that amount, $3 million was paid in cash on March 31, 2017 and $4.66 million was granted in the form of restricted stock units with a three year vesting schedule (as of December 31, 2018 there were two remaining installments – March 1, 2019 (40,018 units) and March 1, 2020 (32,956 units)), with the increase in award value from $4 million to $4.66 million due to the difference between the initial valuation and the grant date values. 
The agreements include the following definitions of cause and good reason: 
"Cause" includes (i) any conviction (including a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere or entry into a pre-trial diversion program) for the commission of a felony or any conviction of any criminal offense within the scope of Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1829; (ii) an act of gross misconduct, fraud, embezzlement, theft or material dishonesty with the executive's duties or in the course of employment with the Company or an affiliate; (iii) failure on the part of executive to perform his employment duties in any material respect, which is not cured to the reasonably satisfaction of the Company within thirty (30) days after the executive receives written notice of such failure; (iv) the executive's violation of the provisions of his employment agreement relating to non-solicitation, confidentiality, ownership of materials, duty to return company property or intellectual property rights; and/or (v) the executive makes any material false or disparaging comments about the Company or any Company affiliate, or any Company or Company affiliate employee, officer, or director, or engages in any such activity which in the opinion of the Company is not consistent with providing an orderly handover of the executive's responsibilities. 
"Good Reason" includes a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities, a material diminution in the executive's base salary other than a general reduction in base salary that affects all similarly situated employees, or a relocation of the executive's principal place of employment by more than fifty (50) miles from his current principal place of employment, unless the new principal place of employment is closer to the executive's home address.

Because the assumed termination date is December 31, 2018, the full target award is reflected, based on the amount of his variable compensation and related mix for the 2018 performance year. Although Mr. Van Saun's estate  would also receive continuation of base salary for the month in which his death occurs, no salary has been included in this table because a termination date of December 31, 2018 is assumed.

CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Bruce Van Saun, our Chief Executive Officer: 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO) was $59,748; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy  Statement, was $9,405,933.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Based on this information, for 2018 the reasonably estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Van Saun, our Chief  Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was 157 to 1.     
   Based on this information, for 2018 the reasonably estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Van Saun, our Chief  Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was 157 to 1.     
   Based on this information, for 2018 the reasonably estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Van Saun, our Chief  Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was 157 to 1.     
   Based on this information, for 2018 the reasonably estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Van Saun, our Chief  Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was 157 to 1.     
[END TABLE]
Because our 2017 median employee is no longer employed by the Company, a new median employee has been selected consistent with the methodology used to select the median employee last year. Specifically, consistent with applicable rules, to identify the median employee we reviewed our employee population as of November 30, 2018 and the amount of their compensation for the period of January 1, 2018 through November 30, 2018 as would be reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 in Box 1, which we determined reasonably reflects the compensation of our employees. This calculation included all of our part-time and full time-employees as of such date. We did not annualize the compensation for any of our employees who were employed by the Company for less than the full 2018 year. In addition, because all our employees are located in the United States, as is our CEO, we did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee. 
Once we identified our median employee, we calculated and combined all of the elements of this employee's compensation for the full 2018 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402 of Regulation S-K. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy ("Director Compensation Policy") governs the compensation of our non-employee directors. The Director Compensation Policy is reviewed on an annual basis by the Compensation Committee, together with its independent compensation consultant, CAP. The Compensation Committee reviews CAP's report and considers the consultant's advice on industry best practice when making decisions regarding director compensation. Any changes to director compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Board. Following the annual review during 2018, modest increases were made to our annual cash retainer (increased $5,000 to $85,000) and equity retainer (increased $5,000 to $125,000) in order to further align our director compensation offering with the same compensation peer group used for executive compensation and performance purposes. These changes were effective as of our annual meeting of

 stockholders held on, April 26, 2018. Below is a summary of the elements of our director compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Cash Retainer    $85,000 
 Annual Restricted Stock Unit Retainer    $125,000 
 Lead Director Cash Retainer    $30,000 
 Audit Committee Member Retainer    $10,000 
 Audit Chair Cash Retainer    $35,000 
 Risk Chair Cash Retainer    $30,000 
 Other Committee Chair Cash Retainers    $20,000 
[END TABLE]
On the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, each non-employee director receives a grant of restricted stock units under the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan ("Directors Plan"), having a fair market value of $125,000, as compensation for their service until the next annual meeting. Restricted stock unit awards vest immediately as of the grant date, subject to the terms and conditions of the Directors Plan and the applicable award agreement. Director awards are subject to mandatory deferral and are not settled until a director's cessation of service. To the extent dividends are declared between the grant and ultimate settlement date, dividend equivalents are reinvested into additional restricted stock units with the same terms and conditions as the related award. 
In addition, directors are eligible to receive matching charitable contributions up to $5,000 per year, as part of our general matching charitable contribution program. Our non-employee directors do not participate in our employee benefit programs. 
Directors may defer up to 100% of their cash compensation under our Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Contributions to this plan are credited with interest on a monthly basis, based on the applicable interest crediting rate applicable for the month interest is to be posted. The interest crediting rate is the annualized average yield on the United States Treasury bond 10-year constant maturity for the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus two percent (2%), which is then divided by 12 to determine the monthly interest crediting rate. There are no Company contributions to this plan and no above-market or preferential earnings on compensation deferred pursuant to this plan. 
Directors also receive reimbursement of business expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings. 
As discussed above in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines", non-employee directors are required to hold shares with a value at least equal to four times their annual cash retainer.

AUDIT MATTERS 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), an independent registered public accounting firm, as the independent auditor to perform an integrated audit of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Deloitte served as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and has served as our independent auditor since becoming a public company in 2014 and prior to that as a privately held company since 2000. 
The Audit Committee periodically considers the rotation of the external auditor to ensure independence. In determining whether to retain Deloitte, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the firm's independence, objectivity, professional skepticism, qualifications, expertise and performance on the Company's audit. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the rotation of the lead audit partner as mandated by SEC requirements and is directly involved in the selection of a new lead audit partner. The current lead audit partner was appointed in 2016 and the next rotation is scheduled for 2021. The Audit Committee also has oversight of the audit firm fee negotiation process and is responsible for approving audit fees. 
The Board believes that the reappointment of Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Neither our Bylaws nor other governing documents or law require stockholder ratification of the selection of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board believes that obtaining stockholder ratification of the appointment is a sound corporate governance practice. If the stockholders do not vote in favor of Deloitte, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment and in doing so, assess the impact of changing the auditor and the appropriate timing for doing so. The Audit Committee may retain Deloitte or hire another firm without resubmitting the matter for stockholders to approve. The Audit Committee retains the discretion at any time to appoint a different independent auditor. 
Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the annual meeting, available to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE COMPANY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist Citizens Financial Group, Inc.'s (the "Company") Board of Directors (the "Board") in its oversight of (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) the appointment, compensation, retention and evaluation of the qualifications, independence, performance of the Company's independent external auditor, (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and (iv) compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a Charter that was last amended and restated by the Board on February 14, 2019. As set forth in the Charter, management of the Company is primarily responsible for the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's financial reporting process, systems of internal accounting and financial controls. Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), the  
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – AUDIT MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
 Company's independent auditor for 2018, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte the matters that are required to be discussed under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") standards. Deloitte has provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the PCAOB-required letter regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Committee concerning independence, and the Committee has discussed with Deloitte their independence giving consideration to the provision of audit and non-audit services and fees paid to the firm. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This report is provided by the following independent directors, who comprise the Audit Committee: 
PRE-APPROVAL OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR SERVICES 
The Audit Committee approves in advance all audit, audit-related, tax, and other services performed by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee pre-approves specific categories of services up to pre-established fee thresholds. Unless the type of service has previously been pre-approved, the Audit Committee must approve that specific service before the independent auditors may perform it. In addition, separate approval is required if the amount of fees for any pre-approved category of service exceeds the fee thresholds established by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may delegate to the chair or any independent member of the Audit Committee pre-approval authority with respect to permitted services, provided that the member must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All fees described below were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

This proxy statement and proxy card are furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting, which will be held on April 25, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Company's headquarters located at One Citizens Plaza, Providence, Rhode Island 02903. 
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card? 
You have received these proxy materials because our board of directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement describes issues on which we would like you to vote at our Annual Meeting. It also gives you information on these issues so that you can make an informed decision. 
Because you own shares of our common stock, our board of directors has made this proxy statement and proxy card available to you on the Internet, in addition to delivering printed versions of this proxy statement and proxy card to certain stockholders by mail. 
When you vote by using the Internet or (if you received your proxy card by mail) by signing and returning the proxy card, you appoint each of Bruce Van Saun, Stephen T. Gannon and Robin S. Elkowitz (with full power of substitution) as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. They will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them or, if an issue that is not on the proxy card comes up for vote, in accordance with their best judgment. This way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance by using the Internet or (if you received your proxy card by mail) by signing and returning your proxy card. If you vote by using the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a printed set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we are permitted to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders by delivering a Notice in the mail. If you received a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review the proxy statement and annual report over the Internet. The Notice also instructs you on how to electronically access and review all of the important information contained in this proxy statement and the annual report and how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting these materials contained in the Notice.

How many votes is each share of common stock entitled to? 
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. As of February 28, 2019, there were 460,390,006 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a "street name" holder? 
Many of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record, and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by the Company. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to certain officers of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. The Company has enclosed or sent a proxy card for you to use. You may also vote on the Internet, as described below under the heading "How do I vote?" 
Beneficial Owner or "Street Name" Holder. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee, like many of our stockholders, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and these proxy materials were forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares, and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank, or other nominee that is the stockholder of record of your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. If you do not wish to vote in person or you will not be attending the Annual Meeting, you may vote by proxy. You may vote by proxy by completing, signing and returning the proxy card or by using the Internet or by telephone, as described below under the heading "How do I vote?". 
How do I vote? 
Stockholders of record may vote by using the Internet or (if you received a proxy card by mail) by mail as described below. Stockholders also may attend the meeting and vote in person. If you hold shares through a bank or broker, please refer to your proxy card, Notice or other information forwarded by your bank or broker to see which voting options are available to you. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote by using the Internet. The address of the website for Internet voting can be found on your proxy card  or Notice. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 24, 2019. Easy-to-follow instructions allow you to  vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote by telephone. Dial the number listed on your proxy card or your voting instruction form. You will need  the control number included on your proxy card or voting instruction form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote by mail. If you received a proxy card by mail and choose to vote by mail, simply mark your proxy card,  date and sign it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019    CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. PROXY STATEMENT – INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS  
[END TABLE]
The method you use to vote will not limit your right to vote at the Annual Meeting if you decide to attend in person. Written ballots will be passed out to anyone who wants to vote at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
What if I change my mind after I return my proxy? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close at the Annual Meeting. You may do this by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a subsequent proxy by using the Internet, telephone or by mail with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sending written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., 600 Washington Boulevard,  Stamford, Connecticut 06901; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold shares through a bank or broker, please refer to your proxy card, Notice or other information forwarded by your bank or broker to see how you can revoke your proxy and change your vote. 
Attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy. 
How many votes do you need to hold the Annual Meeting? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding securities entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is present, we can hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. 
On what items am I voting? 
You are being asked to vote on three items: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  the election of each of the twelve directors nominated by the Board and named in the proxy statement to serve until the  2020 annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  advisory vote to approve the Company's executive compensation, commonly referred to as a "say on pay"  vote; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm  for fiscal year 2019.  
[END TABLE]
No cumulative voting rights are authorized, and dissenters' rights are not applicable to these matters. 
How does the board of directors recommend that I vote? 
The Board recommends that you vote as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  FOR the twelve director nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company's executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  FOR the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.

[END TABLE]
How may I vote in the election of directors, and how many votes must the nominees receive to be elected? 
With respect to the election of directors, you may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR the twelve nominees for director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR any of the nominees for director and vote AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting on the other nominees for director;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote AGAINST the twelve nominees for director; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ABSTAIN from voting on all of the nominees for director.  
[END TABLE]
Our Bylaws provide for the election of directors by an affirmative majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. This means each of the twelve individuals nominated for election to the board of directors must receive more votes cast "FOR" than "AGAINST" (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) to be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose, and will have no effect on the election of nominees. If the election of directors is a contested election, then the directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. 
What happens if a nominee does not receive a majority of "FOR" votes? 
If a nominee does not receive a majority of "FOR" votes, he or she shall tender to the Board, via the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, his or her resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation no later than 60 days following the date of the Annual Meeting in accordance with the specific requirements outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
What happens if a nominee is unable to stand for election? 
If a nominee is unable to stand for election, the Board may either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reduce the number of directors that serve on the Board; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• designate a substitute nominee.  
[END TABLE]
If the Board designates a substitute nominee, shares represented by proxies voted for the nominee who is unable to stand for election will be voted for the substitute nominee. 
How may I cast my advisory vote for the proposal to approve the Company's executive compensation? 
With respect to this proposal, you may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company's executive compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote AGAINST the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company's executive compensation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
In accordance with applicable law, this vote is "advisory," meaning it will serve as a recommendation to the Board, but will not be binding. The Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of this vote when determining future executive compensation arrangements. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast.  
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
How may I vote for the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and how many votes must this proposal receive to pass? 
With respect to this proposal, you may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR the ratification of the accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote AGAINST the ratification of the accounting firm; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
In order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders who are present in person or by proxy. Abstentions will not count as votes cast. 
What happens if I sign and return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions? 
If you return a signed card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  FOR the twelve director nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company's executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  FOR the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
Will my shares be voted if I do not vote by using the Internet, telephone or by signing and returning my proxy card? 
If you do not vote by using the Internet, telephone or (if you received a proxy card by mail) by signing and returning your proxy card, then your shares will not be voted and will not count in deciding the matters presented for stockholder consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in street name through a bank or broker, your bank or broker may vote your shares under certain limited circumstances if you do not provide voting instructions before the Annual Meeting, in accordance with the NYSE rules that govern banks and brokers. These circumstances include voting your shares on "routine matters," such as the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accountants described in this proxy statement. With respect to the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, therefore, if you do not vote your shares, your bank or broker may vote your shares on your behalf or leave your shares unvoted. 
The election of directors and approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company's executive compensation are not considered routine matters under the NYSE rules relating to voting by banks and brokers. When a proposal is not a routine matter and the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is called a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes that are represented at the Annual Meeting will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but not for determining the number of shares voted for or against the non-routine matter. 
We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank or brokerage firm by voting your proxy. This action ensures your shares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your wishes.

[END TABLE]
What is the vote required for each proposal to pass and what is the effect of abstentions or withheld votes and uninstructed shares on the proposals? 
Our Bylaws provide for the election of directors by an affirmative majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. This means that the twelve individuals nominated for election to the board of directors must receive more votes "FOR" than "AGAINST" (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) to be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose, and will have no effect on the election of nominees. If the election of directors is a contested election then the directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. 
For each other proposal to pass in accordance with our Bylaws, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person, electronically or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast. 
What do I need to show to attend the Annual Meeting in person? 
You will need proof of your share ownership (such as a recent brokerage statement or letter from your broker showing that you owned shares of the Company's common stock as of February 28, 2019 if you hold your shares through a broker) and a form of government-issued photo identification. If you do not have proof of ownership and valid photo identification, you may not be admitted to the Annual Meeting. 
If you are the legal representative of a stockholder, you must also bring a letter from the stockholder certifying (a) the beneficial ownership you represent and (b) your status as a legal representative. We will determine in our sole discretion whether the letter presented for admission meets the above requirements. 
No cameras, laptops, tablets, recording equipment, large bags, backpacks, briefcases, and similar items are permitted in the meeting room. Cell phones may not be used during the meeting and we reserve the right to remove individuals who do not adhere to these requirements. 
Who bears the cost of the proxy materials? 
The Company pays for preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the annual report. Officers and employees of the Company may solicit the return of proxies, but will not receive additional compensation for those efforts. The Company will request that brokers, banks, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries send proxy materials to all beneficial owners and upon request will reimburse them for their expenses. Solicitation may be made by mail, telephone or other means. 
Can I receive future proxy materials and annual reports electronically? 
Yes. Instead of receiving future paper copies in the mail, you can elect to receive our future annual reports and proxy materials electronically. Opting to receive your proxy materials electronically will save us the cost of producing and mailing documents to your home or business and will reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings. If you are a stockholder of record and wish to enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service for future meetings, you may do so by going to the website provided on your proxy card and following the prompts.

OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board is not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If any other matter proper for action at the meeting should be presented, the holders of the accompanying proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxy on such matter in accordance with their best judgment. If any matter not proper for action at the meeting should be presented, the holders of the proxy will vote against consideration of the matter or the proposed action. 
2020 ANNUAL MEETING AND STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
The Company will review for inclusion in next year's proxy statement stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 that are received by November 11, 2019. In order for a stockholder proposal or director nomination to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for our annual meeting of stockholders, expected to be held in April 2020, the proposal or director nomination must be received by our Corporate Secretary, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901, on or before the close of business on November 11, 2019, and must comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These stockholder notices also must comply with the requirements of our Bylaws and will not be effective otherwise. 
Our Bylaws impose some procedural requirements on stockholders who wish to nominate directors, propose that a director be removed, propose any repeal or change in our Bylaws or propose any other business to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
Under these procedural requirements, in order to bring a proposal before a meeting of stockholders, a stockholder must deliver timely notice of a proposal pertaining to a proper subject for presentation at the annual meeting to our Corporate Secretary. 
To be timely, a stockholder's notice for proposals outside of SEC Rule 14a-8 must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut, 06901 not less than 120 days or more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, to be presented at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020, such a proposal must be received on or after November 27, 2019, but not later than December 27, 2019. In the event that the date of the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020 is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 70 days from the anniversary date of this year's annual meeting of stockholders, such notice by the stockholder must be so received no earlier than 120 days prior to the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020 and not later than 70 days prior to such annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020 or 10 days following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. 
A stockholder's notice to the Corporate Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act") including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected, (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws, the text of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made:
