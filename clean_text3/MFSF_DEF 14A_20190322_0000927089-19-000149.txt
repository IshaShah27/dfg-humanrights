On March 22, 2019, we mailed to our stockholders of record as of         March 4, 2019, a notice of the Annual Meeting and of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet.  That notice contained instructions on how to access the proxy materials, including requesting an emailed or paper copy, and on how to         cast your vote by Internet, phone or regular mail.  (You also may vote in person at the Annual Meeting by completing a ballot.)  The notice also contained a 16 digit number assigned to each stockholder of record in a box marked by an arrow as         follows: ® xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.  That number is required to vote and to access the proxy materials on the Internet.  If you hold your shares in "street name" with a bank, broker or other nominee, you should be receiving         similar instructions on how to access the proxy materials and vote your shares.
An important part of the Annual Meeting is the stockholder vote on corporate business items.

ANNUAL MEETING TO BE HELD MAY 1,             2019
INTRODUCTION
The Board of Directors of MutualFirst Financial, Inc., is using this Proxy Statement to solicit         proxies from the holders of the Company's common stock for use at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019, at 3:00 p.m., local time, at the Company's main office located at 110 E.         Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to vote on four proposals:  (1) the           election of David W. Heeter and Brian C. Hewitt as directors of the Company for terms to expire in 2022, Edward C. Levy for a term to expire in 2021 and Michael J. Marien for a term to expire in 2020; (2) an advisory (non-binding) resolution to           approve our executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement; (3) approval of the Company's 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan; and (4) ratification of the appointment of BKD, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  These proposals are described           in more detail below.  Stockholders also will consider any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting, although the Board of Directors knows of no other business to be presented.
MutualFirst Financial, Inc. may be referred to from time to time in this Proxy Statement           as "MutualFirst" or the "Company."  Some of the information in this Proxy Statement relates to MutualBank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,           which may be referred to from time to time in this Proxy Statement as the "Bank."
By submitting your proxy, you authorize the Company's Board of Directors to represent           you and vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions.  The Board also may vote your shares to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time and will be authorized to vote your shares at any adjournments or           postponements of the Annual Meeting.
The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ending December 31, 2018, which           includes the Company's audited financial statements, is being provided with this Proxy Statement.  Although this report is being made available to stockholders with this Proxy Statement, it does not constitute a part of the proxy solicitation           materials and is not incorporated into this Proxy Statement by reference.
Again this year, we are distributing the Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to           Stockholders over the Internet at http://www.proxyvote.com.  In addition, stockholders will be able to cast their votes on the Internet or by phone.  On March 22, 2019, we mailed to our stockholders of record as of March 4, 2019, a notice of the           Annual Meeting and of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet ("March 22 Notice").  That notice contains instructions on how to access the proxy           materials and Annual Report, including requesting an emailed or paper copy, and how to cast your vote by Internet, phone or regular mail or in person at the meeting.
Your               vote is important.  You may vote by Internet or telephone, by sending a completed Proxy Card by regular mail or by submitting a ballot in person at the Annual Meeting.  We encourage you to attend the Annual Meeting in person no matter           how you decide to cast your vote.  Please read the Proxy Statement and vote your shares as promptly as possible to ensure you are represented at the             meeting. 2019 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY
This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.  It does not contain all           the information you should consider before voting, and you should read the entire Proxy Statement carefully before voting.  This summary also contains our 2018 Business Highlights.  You should refer to the Annual Report to Stockholders for the           year ending December 31, 2018, which is being made available with this Proxy Statement, for more complete information about the Company's year-end financial condition and 2018 operating results.
2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
At December 31, 2018, we had $2.0 billion in assets, $1.5 billion in loans, $1.5 billion in deposits and           $202.4 million in stockholders' equity. Earnings for 2018 were $18.9 million. This increase occurred as a result of the acquisition of Universal and a lower tax rate.
For the year ending December 31, 2018, we earned $18.9 million, or $2.25 per basic and $2.21 per diluted           share, compared with net income of $12.3 million, or $1.67 per basic and $1.64 per diluted share for 2017.  The details of our 2018 performance are described in the accompanying Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ending December 31, 2018,           in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the audited consolidated financial statements.
Key aspects of our 2018 operations include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Return on average assets of .97% in 2018 compared to .78% in 2017.  
• Return on average tangible common equity of 11.66% in 2018 compared to 8.52% in 2017.  
• A $5.1 million, or 85.8%, increase in non-performing assets and a $5.5 million, or 31.2%, increase in classified                      assets.  
• Net charge-offs of .09% in 2018 compared to .10% in 2017.

Four of our current directors have been nominated by the Board for re-election for terms to expire as           indicated below their name. The nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 David W. Heeter (2022)     Director of the Company and the Bank. President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chief Executive Officer                    of the Bank since 2003.  
 Brian C. Hewitt (2022)     Former Director of Universal Bancorp and BloomBank, appointed to the Company's and Bank's Board on February 28, 2018 in                    connection with Company's merger with Universal Bancorp, Inc.  
 Edward C. Levy (2021)     Director of the Company and Bank since 2008.  Officer and owner of Freeman-Spicer Financial Services, Inc.  
 Michael J. Marien (2020)     Director of the Company and Bank since 2008.  Employed by R.W. Baird, a registered broker, dealer and investment                    advisory firm.  
[END TABLE]
No stockholder nominations have been made for consideration at the Annual Meeting. In considering your vote           on these nominees, we refer you to "Proposal 1 - Election of Directors" on pages 11 to 14 for more information about these nominees and director compensation and to "Board of Directors' Meetings and Committees and Corporate Governance Matters" on           pages 16 to 18 respecting our corporate governance matters.
The Board recommends you vote for these             four nominees.  These nominees, as well as the rest of the directors, have varied skills and experience necessary to oversee the Company effectively and have proven leadership, sound judgment and have committed significant time and           effort dedicated to the success of our Company. ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Proposal 2
Since 2009, our stockholders have had the opportunity at each Annual Meeting to cast an advisory           (non-binding) vote on our executive compensation as disclosed in each proxy statement for those meetings.  We are gratified that, each year, our stockholders have evidenced support of our executive compensation program by an overwhelming margin.
Stockholders have an opportunity to cast another (non-binding), advisory vote on our executive compensation           program disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  We refer you to "Proposal 2 - Advisory (Non-Binding) Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation" on page 35.
In evaluating this say-on-pay proposal, we recommend that you review the disclosure of our executive           compensation program, including our compensation program, philosophy and objectives and the level of compensation to our five named executive officers at "Executive Compensation" on pages 19 to 34.  Our Board asks that you vote for the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve executive compensation.
APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S 2019 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN – Proposal 3
On March 20, 2019, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, our Board of Directors           approved the Company's 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the long term success, and enhance the long-term value of the Company by further linking personal interests of employees and directors with those of the           Company's Stockholders. The 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan is further intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of employees and directors upon whose judgement, interest and special           effort the successful conduct of its operation largely is dependent, in a manner that does not expose the Company to imprudent risks and that is consistent with the long-term health of the Company.  In considering this proposal, we refer you to           Proposal 3 – Approval of the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan on pages 36- 45 for more detailed information regarding the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Our Board             asks that you vote for the approval of the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan.
RATIFICATION OF BKD, LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT AUDITOR – Proposal 4
The Audit/Compliance Committee has selected BKD, LLP as our audit firm for 2019.  The Board is asking the           stockholders to ratify that appointment.  Though the stockholder vote on ratification is not binding on the Audit/Compliance Committee, the Committee will consider the stockholders' views on this matter when deciding whether to continue to retain           BKD, LLP in the current or next year.  In considering this matter, we refer you to "Proposal 4 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" on pages 47 to 48, including information regarding fees paid to BKD,           LLP over the prior two years and the types of services provided by the firm.  Our Board asks that you vote for the ratification of BKD, LLP as the Company's             audit firm for 2019.

The           presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least one-third of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non‑votes           will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Annual Meeting.
What if a quorum is not present           at the Annual Meeting?
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the Annual Meeting, the stockholders           who are represented may adjourn the Annual Meeting until a quorum is present.  The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice of the adjourned meeting will be given, unless           the adjourned meeting is held after June 30, 2019.  An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the Annual Meeting. How do I vote?
You may vote by internet.  To vote by Internet, have in hand a copy of the Proxy Card and the 16 digit identification number assigned to you in a box marked by an arrow (® xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)           on the Proxy Card, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions for voting.  The deadline for voting online is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 30, 2019.  If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, check the voting           form you received from that firm in order to determine whether, and how, you can vote online.
You may vote by phone.  To vote by phone, have in hand a copy of the Proxy Card and the 16 digit identification number assigned to you in a box marked by an arrow (® xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)           on the Proxy Card, call the toll-free phone number 1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions for voting.  The deadline for voting by phone is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 30, 2019.  If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other           nominee, check the voting form you received from that firm in order to determine whether, and how, you can vote by phone.
You may vote by mail.  To vote by mail, request a paper copy of the           Proxy Card or all the proxy materials as noted in the response to the previous question.  Then complete, sign and date the Proxy Card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided or mail it to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes           Way, Edgewood, NY  11717, in a timely manner.  The mailed card must be received by the Company before the start of the Annual Meeting.  If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, check the voting form you received from that           firm in order to determine whether, and how, you can vote by mail.
You may vote in person at the annual meeting.  If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and           wish to vote in person, we will give you a ballot at the meeting.  Note, however, that if your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to obtain a proxy from the record holder of your shares indicating           that you were the beneficial owner of those shares at the close of business on March 4, 2019, the record date for voting at the Annual Meeting.  You are encouraged to vote by proxy prior to the Annual Meeting, even if you plan to attend the           meeting.
What if I return my executed Proxy Card without voting instructions?
Where properly executed proxies are returned to us without specific voting instructions,           your shares will be voted by the proxy holders named on the Proxy Card "FOR" the election of management's director nominees, "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve our executive compensation "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Omnibus           Incentive Plan and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.
What if other business is presented at the Annual Meeting?
Should any other matters be properly presented at the Annual Meeting for action, the           proxy holders named on the Proxy Card and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.  No other matters currently are expected by the Board of Directors to be properly presented at           the Annual Meeting.
What if my shares are held in           "street name" by a broker?
If your shares are held in "street name" by a broker, your broker is required to vote           your shares in accordance with your instructions.  If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker will be entitled to vote your shares with respect to "discretionary" items.  However, your broker will not be permitted to vote your           shares with respect to "non-discretionary" items, and your shares will be treated as "broker non-votes."  Whether an item is discretionary is determined by the exchange rules governing your broker.  The election of directors and the advisory           (non-binding) votes regarding executive compensation and the approval of the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan are non-discretionary items.  The ratification of our auditors is a discretionary item.  Your broker will forward information to you           indicating how you can forward voting instructions and whether you can forward them by Internet, mail or phone. What if my shares are held in           the Bank's employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP")?
If you are a participant in the Bank's ESOP, the plan trustee is required to vote the           shares allocated to your account under the plan in accordance with your instructions.  If you do not instruct the trustee how to vote your allocated shares, the trustee may vote your allocated shares in its sole discretion.
What if my shares are held in the Company's 401(k) plan?
If you are one of our employees who owns Company shares in our 401(k) plan, you will           receive voting instructions with respect to all the MutualFirst shares allocated to your account.  You are entitled to direct the trustee how to vote your shares.  If you do not provide instructions, your shares will be voted by the trustee in           its sole discretion.
Can I change my vote after I           submit my proxy?
Yes, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close at           the Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• properly submitting a later-dated proxy by Internet or phone by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 30, 2019;  
• properly mailing a later-dated proxy that is received by the Company before the start of the Annual Meeting;  
• giving written notice of the revocation of your proxy to the Company's Secretary prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
• voting in person by ballot at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Your proxy will not be automatically revoked just by your attendance at the Annual           Meeting.  You must actually vote at the meeting by submitting a ballot in order to revoke a prior proxy.  If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow directions received from your nominee to change           your voting instructions to that nominee.
How will abstentions be treated?
If you abstain from voting, your shares will be included for purposes of determining           whether a quorum is present.  Because directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, abstaining is not offered as a voting option for Proposal 1.  If you abstain from voting on Proposals 2, 3 or 4 your shares will not be included in           the number of shares voting on the proposal and, consequently, your abstention will have no effect on whether the proposal is approved.
How will broker non-votes be treated?
Shares treated as broker non-votes on one or more proposal will be included for purposes of calculating the           presence of a quorum but will not be counted as votes cast.  Proposal 1 is a non-discretionary item that includes broker non-votes; however, because the directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, the broker non-votes will have no           impact on the election results.  If you do not instruct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares on Proposal 2 and 3, your shares will not be included in the number of shares voting on the proposal and will have no effect on whether           the proposal is approved.  Proposal 4 is a discretionary item, so your broker is entitled to cast a vote without receiving instructions from you.  If, however, your broker does not cast any votes absent your instructions, these broker non-votes           will have no effect on whether the proposal is approved.
Vote required to approve Proposal 1: Election of four directors.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the           Annual Meeting by holders of MutualFirst common stock.  Stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.  Votes may be cast for or withheld from each nominee.  Votes that are withheld and broker non-votes will           be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect on the election of directors. What happens if a nominee is unable to stand for election?
If a nominee is unable to stand for election, the Board of Directors may either reduce           the number of directors to be elected or select a substitute nominee.  If a substitute nominee is selected, the Board of Directors, as holder of your proxy, will vote your shares for the substitute nominee, unless you have withheld authority to           vote for the nominee replaced.
Vote required to approve Proposal 2: Advisory resolution to approve           our executive compensation.
The adoption of the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve our executive           compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting.
Vote required to approve Proposal 3: Approval of the Company's 2019           Omnibus Incentive Plan.
The approval of the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan as disclosed in this           Proxy Statement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting.
Vote required to approve Proposal 4: Ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.
The ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm           requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares cast, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting.
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on the proposals?
Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of                      four director nominees to the Board of Directors, for terms as indicated in this proxy statement;  
• FOR the adoption of                      an advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve our executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement;  
• FOR the approval of                      the Company's 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan; and  
• FOR the                          ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

STOCK OWNERSHIP
Stock Ownership of Significant           Stockholders, Directors and Executive Officers
The following table shows, as of March 4, 2019, the beneficial ownership of the Company's           common stock by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any persons or entities known by management to beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Company                      common stock;  
• each director and director nominee of the Company;  
• each executive officer of the Company and the Bank named in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" appearing below; and  
• all of the executive officers and directors of the Company and the Bank as a group.  
[END TABLE]
The address of each of the beneficial owners, except where otherwise indicated, is the           Company's address.  As of March 4, 2019, there were 8,624,462 shares of Company common stock issued and outstanding.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC.  In           computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options beneficially owned and held by that person that are currently exercisable or           exercisable within 60 days after March 4, 2019, are deemed outstanding.  Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

             Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's           directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10 percent of the Company's common stock, to report to the SEC their initial ownership of the Company's common stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership.  Specific due dates           for these reports have been established by the SEC and the Company is required to disclose in this Proxy Statement any late filings or failures to file.
To the Company's knowledge, based solely on its review of the Section 16 reports filed           by its directors and executive officers and written representations from those directors and executive officers, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the Company's executive officers and directors during the year ending December           31, 2018, were met, with the exception of two Form 3s filed late for directors Altobella and Bernard and one report covering 1,000 shares for Director Bernard and one report covering 49 shares for Director Hughes. PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
General
The Company's Board of Directors consists of 13 directors, divided into three classes.            Directors in each class generally are elected to serve for three-year terms that expire in successive years.  The term of one of the classes of MutualFirst's directors will expire at the Annual Meeting. As a result of Company policy that requires           directors to resign from the Board at the Annual Meeting following their attainment of 72 years of age, Director Rosema will retire as a member of the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting. The Board thanks Mr. Rosema for many years of           dedicated service. Due to Director Rosema's departure as a director from the Board, the Company anticipates reducing the size of its Board at the Annual Meeting.
In addition, James M. Bernard was elected as a Director for a term ending at the 2020           Annual Meeting, pursuant to an agreement dated March 16, 2018 with Ancora Advisors and certain of its affiliates, including Mr. Bernard (the "Ancora Parties"). In order to address the concerns of the Ancora Parties, the Company nominated Mr.           Bernard to the Board. Mr. Bernard has financial institution experience and is a Chartered Financial Analyst. Together in 2018 with the Ancora Parties, Mr. Bernard owns 6.2% of the company's stock.
Nominees and Directors
The Company's Board of Directors, based on the recommendations of the Nominating           Committee, has nominated David W. Heeter and Brian C. Hewitt for election as Directors for three-year terms expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2022, Edward C. Levy for election as a Director for a two-year term expiring           at the Annual Meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021 and Michael J. Marien for a one-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020. All of the Company's Directors who currently serve also serve as Directors of           the Bank. All Directors are required to retire at the Annual Meeting following the attainment of age 72 pursuant to Company policy.
The following table describes the Directors who are up for election at the Annual           Meeting.

Business Experience and Qualifications of Directors
The Board believes that the many years of service that our Directors have at the           Company, the Bank or other financial institutions acquired by the Company is one of their most important qualifications for continued service on our Board.  This service has given them extensive knowledge of the banking business and our Company.            Furthermore, their service on Board committees, especially in areas of audit, compliance, compensation and trust business is critical to their ability to oversee the management of the Company and the Bank by our executive officers.  Service on           the Board by three of our senior executive officers aids the outside directors' understanding of the critical and complicated issues that are common in the banking business.  Each outside director brings special skills, experience and expertise           to the Board as a result of their other business activities and associations.  The business experience for at least the past five years and the experience, qualifications, attributes, skills and areas of expertise of each director that further           supports his service as a director are set forth below.

Director             Compensation
The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and           retain qualified persons to serve as non-employee directors of the Company and the Bank.  Each director of the Company also is a director of the Bank.  Directors are not compensated separately for their service on the Company's Board of           Directors.  In setting director compensation, the Board of Directors considers the significant amount of time and level of skill required for service on the Boards of the Company and the Bank, particularly due to the duties imposed on directors           of public companies and financial institutions.  The types and levels of director compensation are annually reviewed and set by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the full Board of Directors.
For the year ending December 31, 2018, each director received an annual fee of $34,000           for serving on the Bank's Board of Directors, except for Messrs. Heeter, Botts, and Viater, who were compensated as executive officers of the Bank and are not separately compensated as directors.  Mr. Davis receives an additional $10,000 per year           for serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors; Mr. Crull receives an additional $5,000 for serving as the Chairman of the Audit/Compliance Committee; Mr. Lashley receives an additional $3,000 for serving as Chairman of the Compensation           Committee; and Mr. Hughes receives an additional $3,000 for serving as the Chairman of the Wealth Management Committee.  In addition, each director receives $200.00 per Board committee meeting attended and the Audit/Compliance Committee members           receive $400.00 per meeting attended. No stock options were granted to directors in 2018.
The Bank maintains deferred compensation arrangements with some directors, which allowed           them to defer all or a portion of their Board fees earned before September 2008 and earn interest on deferred amounts at the rate of 10% per year, which rate was set at the inception of the plan in 1993 and was not an above-market rate at that           time.  Participants receive the deferred amounts as income when they are no longer serving as active directors.  The participant may choose to receive the deferred payments in a lump sum or in annual installments for 15 years beginning at age 70.
Messrs. Levy and Marien were parties to           director fee continuation agreements with the institution acquired in 2008, which were assumed by the Company.  Those agreements provided that if the director retired after attaining age 72 and had served as a director for at least five years, he           would be entitled to an annual retirement benefit for five years (or 10 years, if the director had more than 10 years of service) equal to 50% of the total fees paid to him during the last plan year before ending service.  These agreements also           provided that, in the event of a change in control followed within 24 months by a termination of service as a director prior to age 72, the director would be entitled to receive the present value of the normal retirement benefit (without regard           to years of service) paid in a lump sum. Director Compensation Table for 2018
The following table provides compensation information for each member           of our Board of Directors during the year ending December 31, 2018 (except for Messrs. Heeter, Botts and Viater, whose compensation is reported as named executive officers).

 Business Relationships and           Transactions with Executive Officers, Directors and Related Persons
The Company and the Bank may engage in transactions or series of transactions with our           directors, executive officers and certain persons related to them.  Except for loans by the Bank, which are governed by a separate policy, these transactions are considered "related party" transactions under applicable regulations of the SEC and           are subject to review and approval of the Audit/Compliance Committee and ratification by the Board of Directors.  All other transactions with executive officers, directors and related persons are approved by the Board of Directors.
The Bank has a written policy of granting loans to officers and           directors, which fully complies with all applicable federal regulations.  Loans to directors and executive officers are made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms and conditions, including interest rates and           collateral, as those of comparable transactions with non-insiders prevailing at the time, in accordance with the Bank's underwriting guidelines, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable           features.  These loans to directors and executive officers are not made at preferential rates; however, certain closing fees are waived.  No director, executive officer or any of their affiliates had aggregate indebtedness to the Bank at           below-market interest rates exceeding $120,000 in the aggregate since December 31, 2018.  Loans to all directors and executive officers and their associates totaled approximately $12.7 million at December 31, 2018, which was approximately 6.3% of           the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity at that date.  All loans to directors and executive officers were performing in accordance with their terms at December 31, 2018.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES AND
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
Board Meetings, Independence and Ethics Code
Meetings of the Company's Board of Directors are generally held on a           monthly basis. The Company's Board of Directors held 12 regular meetings and one ADHOC meeting during the year ending December 31, 2018. During 2018, each of the directors of the Company attended 80% or more of the aggregate of the total number           of Board meetings and the total number of meetings of the Board committees on which the director served.  Generally, all directors attend each annual meeting of stockholders, and all but one of our directors attended last year's annual meeting.
The Board has determined that Directors Crull, Davis, Hewitt, Lashley,           Levy, Marien, Rosema, Altobella and Bernard, who constitute a majority of our Board members, are "independent directors," as that term is defined in the NASDAQ listing standards.  Among other things, when making this determination, the Board           considers each director's current or previous employment relationships and material transactions or relationships with the Company or the Bank, members of their immediate family and entities in which the director has a significant interest.  The           purpose of this review is to determine whether any relationships or transactions exist or have occurred that are inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent.  Among other matters, in reaching its determination on           independence, the Board considered the fact that certain of the directors or their affiliates have borrowed money from the Bank.  See "Election of Directors - Business Relationships and Transactions with Executive Officers, Directors and Related           Persons."
Stockholders may communicate directly with the Board of Directors by           sending written communications to Wilbur R. Davis, Chairman of the Board, MutualFirst Financial, Inc., 110 E. Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana            47305-2400.
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to           all directors, officers and employees.  You may obtain a copy of the Code free of charge by writing to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, 110 E. Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana  47305-2400 or by calling (765) 747-2800.  In addition, the Code           of Business Conduct and Ethics was filed with the SEC as Exhibit 14 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2003, and is available at http://www.bankwithmutual.com/conduct.
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
As noted above, the positions of Chairman of the Board of the Company and Chief Executive           Officer and President of the Company are held by separate persons.  This has been the case since the Company was formed.  The Board believes this structure is appropriate for the Company and the Bank because it creates a           clear line between management by the executive management and oversight of management by the Board of Directors, led by the Chairman.
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of the Company has standing Audit/Compliance, Compensation, Wealth           Management and Nominating Committees.  The Board of Directors has adopted written charters for the Audit/Compliance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee.  Copies of the charters for the Audit/Compliance Committee,           Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee are available on our website at http://www.bankwithmutual.com/Committees.  You also may obtain a copy of these           committee charters free of charge by writing to the Corporate Secretary, MutualFirst Financial, Inc., 110 E. Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana            47305-2400 or by calling (765) 747-2800.
Audit/Compliance Committee
The Audit/Compliance Committee is comprised of Directors Crull (Chairman), Bernard,           Davis, Lashley and Levy, all of whom are "independent directors" under the NASDAQ listing standards.  No member of the Audit/Compliance Committee had any relationship with the Company or the Bank requiring disclosure under Item 404 of SEC           Regulation S-K, which requires the disclosure of certain related person transactions.  The Board of Directors has determined that Directors Crull, Lashley and Levy each is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(e) of           Regulation S-K of the SEC and that all of the Audit/Compliance Committee members meet the independence and financial literacy requirements under the NASDAQ listing standards.  In 2018, the Audit/Compliance Committee met four times.
The Audit/Compliance Committee is responsible for hiring, terminating and/or reappointing           the Company's independent auditor and for reviewing the annual audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm.  The functions of the Audit/Compliance Committee also include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving non-audit and audit services to be performed by the independent registered public                      accounting firm;  
• reviewing and approving all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest                      situations;  
• reviewing and assessing the adequacy of the Audit/Compliance Committee Charter on an annual basis;  
• reviewing significant financial information for the purpose of giving added assurance that the                      information is accurate and timely and that it includes all appropriate financial statement disclosures;  
• ensuring the existence of effective accounting and internal control systems; and  
• overseeing the entire audit function of the Company, both internal and independent.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is comprised of six independent directors, Directors Lashley (Chairman), Altobella, Crull, Davis, Marien and Rosema. No member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with the Company or the           Bank requiring disclosure under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K, which requires the disclosure of certain related person transactions.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for:
[BEGIN TABLE]

• overseeing the administration of the employee benefit plans covering employees generally;  
• administering the Company's cash and equity compensation incentive plans;  
• setting Board and Board committee fees; and  
• reviewing our compensation policies and programs.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Compensation Committee met five times during the year ending December 31, 2018. The Compensation Committee does not delegate its authority to any one of its members or any other person.  The Compensation Committee did           not retain any compensation consultants in 2018 to determine or recommend the level or form of director or executive compensation. The Compensation Committee also reviews our incentive compensation plans to determine if they encourage undue or           unnecessary risk or the manipulation of earnings. Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee is comprised of Directors Davis (Chairman), Altobella, Bernard,           Crull and, Lashley.  The Nominating Committee is primarily responsible for selecting and recommending nominees for election to the Board.  The Nominating Committee generally meets once per year to make nominations.  The Nominating Committee will           consider nominees recommended by stockholders in accordance with the procedures in the Company's bylaws, but the Nominating Committee has not actively solicited such nominations.  The Nominating Committee has the following responsibilities under           its charter:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommend to the Board the appropriate size of the Board and assist in identifying, interviewing and recruiting                      candidates for the Board;  
• recommend candidates (including incumbents) for election and appointment to the Board of Directors, subject to the                      provisions set forth in the Company's charter and bylaws relating to the nomination or appointment of directors, based on the following criteria: business experience, education, integrity and reputation, independence, conflicts of                      interest, diversity, age, number of other directorships and commitments (including charitable obligations), tenure on the Board, attendance at Board and committee meetings, stock ownership, specialized knowledge (such as an                      understanding of banking, accounting, marketing, finance, regulation and public policy) and a commitment to the Company's communities and shared values, as well as overall experience in the context of the needs of the Board as a whole;  
• review nominations submitted by stockholders, which have been addressed to the Corporate Secretary, and which comply                      with the requirements of the Company's charter and bylaws;  
• consider and evaluate nominations from stockholders using the same criteria as all other nominations;  
• annually recommend to the Board committee assignments and committee chairs on all committees of the Board, and                      recommend committee members to fill vacancies on committees as necessary; and  
• perform any other duties or responsibilities expressly delegated to the Committee by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, the Nominating Committee Charter provides for a number of criteria that           are considered when selecting new members of the Board.  Those criteria, as well as viewpoint, skill, race, gender and national origin, are considered by the Nominating Committee and the Board when seeking to fill a vacancy or a new seat on the           Board in order to consider diversity on our Board of Directors.
Nominations, other than those made by the Nominating Committee, must be made pursuant to           timely notice in writing to the Corporate Secretary as set forth in Article I, Section 1.09 of the Company's bylaws.  In general, to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received by the Company not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days           prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; however, if less than 100 days' notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting is given by the Company, the stockholder has until the close of business on the tenth day           following the day on which notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was made.  The stockholder's notice must include the information set forth in Article I, Section 1.09 of the Company's bylaws, which includes the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as to each person whom a stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director: all information relating to the                      proposed nominee that is required to be disclosed in the solicitation of proxies for election as directors or is otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and  
• as to the stockholder giving the notice: the name and address of the stockholder as they appear                      on the Company's books and the number of shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by the stockholder.  
[END TABLE]
This description is a summary of our nominating process.  Any stockholder wishing to           propose a director candidate to the Company should review and must comply in full with the procedures set forth in the Company's charter and bylaws and in Maryland law.  During the year ending December 31, 2018, the Nominating Committee was           responsible for selecting director nominees and met one time with respect to the selection of director nominees. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
In this section, we provide an overview and analysis of our compensation programs, the material compensation           policy decisions we have made under those programs, and the material factors that we have considered in making those decisions.  Following this section, you will find a series of tables containing specific information about compensation paid or           payable to the following individuals, whom we refer to as our "named executive officers."
David W. Heeter – President and Chief Executive Officer
Christopher D. Cook – Chief Financial Officer
Patrick C. Botts – Executive Vice President
Charles J. Viater – Senior Vice President
Christopher L. Caldwell – Senior Vice President, MutualBank
The discussion below is intended to help you understand the detailed information provided in those tables and           put that information into context within our overall compensation program.
Philosophy and Objectives of           Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee has established a broad-based compensation program to address           compensation for directors, executive officers and other employees.  The overall goals of this compensation program help the Company and the Bank attract, motivate and retain talented and dedicated executives, orient its executives toward the           achievement of business goals and link the compensation of its executives to the Company's success.  The Compensation Committee seeks to establish compensation levels that attract highly effective executives who work well as a team.  In           determining compensation levels based on Company performance, the Committee compares MutualFirst to a peer group of approximately 33 Midwest bank holding companies with subsidiary financial institutions ranging in size from $1.0 billion to $3.0           billion with similar balance sheets. The Compensation Committee evaluates this peer group periodically to ensure it closely resembles MutualFirst. In addition, our compensation philosophy is based on established principles for all pay practices           and aligns with our corporate values, which are to conduct our business with character, compassion, class and competition.  We reflect these values in our compensation by ensuring competitive and fair practices.  Our overriding principles in setting types and amounts of compensation are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Merit/Performance Based – Individual compensation is linked to the successful achievement of performance objectives.  
• Market Competition – Total compensation that attracts, retains and motivates our top performers at a competitive level                      in our market.  
• Stockholder Balance – Compensation components that align the interests of key management,                      especially the named executive officers, with those of our stockholders in furtherance of our goal to increase stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
The Company implements this philosophy by using a combination of cash and stock-based           compensation, benefits and perquisites to attract and retain qualified persons to serve as executive officers of the Company and the Bank.  Our compensation program seeks to reach an appropriate balance between base salary (to provide competitive           fixed compensation), incentive opportunities in performance-based cash bonuses (to provide rewards for meeting performance goals) and equity compensation (to align our executives' interests with our stockholders' interests).
The Compensation Committee and the Board have established a variable incentive           compensation program that provides for cash incentive payments to designated executives of the Company, including the five named executive officers, based on Company performance, as reflected in basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") for each           fiscal year (see "- Non-Equity Incentive Plans").  In addition, in 2008, the stockholders approved a stock option plan that authorizes the Compensation Committee to award options to directors, officers and other employees (see "- Equity Incentive           Plan").  Stock options encourage our executives to own and retain a meaningful stake in the Company's common stock, thereby aligning their long-term interests with those of our           stockholders.  Both of these compensation programs encourage our executive officers to achieve the Company's financial and other performance goals.
Each executive officer of the Company also is an executive officer of the Bank.            Executive officers are not compensated separately for their service to the Company.  The Compensation Committee considers the significant amount of time and level of skill required to perform the required duties of each executive's position,           taking into account the complexity of our business as a regulated public company and financial institution.
The Company provides benefits, including health care           benefits, to all employees to attract and retain highly effective executives and other employees with an opportunity to maintain a quality standard of living over time and to have access to health care.  These benefits are administered           consistently to all levels of the organization.  All employees share in the cost of health benefits based on the coverage they select.  In addition, employees share the cost of their health insurance premiums based on their compensation level.            Available health care benefits are commensurate with that available in our market area. In addition, the Company provides various perquisites designed to enhance the success of the Company.
Components of             Executive Compensation. 
The components of our compensation program are as follows:
Base Salary.  A base salary is established for each executive to reflect the potential contribution of the executive to the achievement of the Bank's business           objectives and to be competitive with base salaries paid by other comparable financial institutions.  The level of each executive officer's base salary is designed to reward performance for carrying out the required day-to-day activities and           responsibilities of each officer's position.  The Committee utilizes outside resources to ascertain appropriate base salaries for our officers and other employees.  The Committee also is cognizant of the salaries paid by other non-financial           institution companies in the Bank's market area with which it believes the Bank competes for executives.  Through its merit increase planning guide, the Bank increases salaries based upon competitive market conditions, the Bank's past and           expected financial performance and the individual employee's performance.  Base salary is the largest element of the Company's compensation program because it fairly compensates individuals for fulfilling their daily responsibilities and           obligations.
Annual Incentive               Cash Bonus Compensation.  The MutualBank 2018 Executive Variable Compensation Plan provided for cash incentive payments to designated executives of the Company, including the five named executive officers.  This cash incentive plan           provides for one-time payments to the designated executives based on the Company's 2018 Basic EPS.  Under the plan, cash payments were calculated as a percentage of 2018 base salary, with the appropriate percentage determined by whether a           targeted Basic EPS level was met for 2018.  For the named executive officers of the Company, the plan established seven designated Basic EPS levels (including the Company's target Basic EPS based on its 2018 budget) based upon internal forecasts           for the performance of the Company and a range of percentage of salary cash incentive payments for meeting these designated Basic EPS levels based upon each officer's anticipated contribution to that performance.  For additional information, see "Non-Equity Incentive Plans."
Equity                 Compensation.  The Company has utilized equity compensation in the form of stock options and restricted stock to align the interests of our named executive officers with our shareholders and to reward those individuals'           contributions to our franchise value over time.
The Company established a 2008 Stock Option and Incentive Plan providing for the award of           options or stock appreciation rights for up to 352,741 shares of our common stock.  This plan is administered by the Compensation Committee.  Shares are no longer available for awards under this plan.
Benefits.              The Company provides benefits to all employees with an opportunity to maintain a quality standard of living over time and to have access to health care.  These benefits help us to attract and retain highly effective executives and other           employees.  These welfare benefits are administered consistently to all levels of the organization.  All employees share in the cost of health benefits based on the coverage they elect.  Health insurance premiums are paid by the Bank based on employee compensation levels.  Available health care benefits           are commensurate with that available in our market area.
The Company has designed retirement plans or programs to ensure our employees have adequate           income levels after employment.  The Company maintains a KSOP, which is subject to Department of Labor and IRS requirements.  The Compensation Committee determines the amount of Company contributions to the 401(k) portion of the plan for all           employees.  It has been the Company's practice to contribute 100% of the first 4% contributed by a participant and a matching 50% for the next 2% contributed providing for a total of a 5% contribution on behalf of MutualBank for those employees           choosing to contribute 6% or more. The employee stock ownership plan component of the plan ("ESOP") was designed to ensure all employees have a vested interest in the success of the Company.  The ESOP purchased shares of the Company's stock in           1999, which were allocated to employees annually over 15 years.  These plans were funded by the Company to help provide retirement income for non-executive employees at normal retirement age of approximately 60% to 70% of pre-retirement income           for employees that dedicate their career to the Company.
Because tax-qualified plans limit funding for certain highly           compensated employees and are not available to directors, the Company has established other retirement compensation plans for those individuals.  Certain officers, including some of the named executive officers, and certain directors are entitled           to defer compensation under nonqualified plans.  The deferred compensation plan for executive officers enables them to supplement their retirement income under our qualified plans to provide them with approximately 10% of their salary at           retirement as retirement income, if and to the extent they participate in the program.  For additional information regarding these plans, see "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation – Executive Deferred Compensation Agreements" and "Director           Compensation."  The Company also maintains an Executive Benefit Plan for key employees, including some of the named executive officers.  See "Retirement Plans" for more information about the Executive Benefit Plan.  The deferred compensation           program and Executive Benefit Plan are designed to provide career executive officer retirees, in conjunction with Social Security, tax qualified retirement plans and the ESOP, with approximately 70% of their pre-retirement income.
Four of our named executive officers have three-year employment           agreements that provide for special payments to the executives in case of a change in control of the Company or an involuntary termination of the executive for other than cause (as defined in the agreements). One of our named executive officers           has a change in control agreement in which he will receive a payment in the event of a change in control of the Company. These agreements are common benefits for executives of publicly traded financial institutions, and the Company believes they           are important in order to attract and retain qualified executive management.  Certain of our benefit plans also provide for accelerated payments or other benefits upon a change in control of the Company or an involuntary termination of the           executive for other than cause.  See "Potential Termination and Change in Control Payments."
Perquisites.  The Company provides perquisites designed to enhance the success of the Company.  Executive officer education is provided at industry conferences, seminars and schools, sometimes with spousal travel           expenses.  Dues to country clubs, social clubs and service organizations are paid to encourage community involvement and build business relationships.  Messrs. Heeter, Botts, Viater and Caldwell receive a car allowance, and the value of the allowance is included in their taxable income.
Stock Ownership               Guidelines.  We have in place Board-approved stock ownership guidelines applicable to our Section 16 officers (those officers           reporting share ownership to the SEC) as well as our non-employee directors. These guidelines were established to further reinforce the alignment of the financial interests of these executives and non-employee directors with those of our           long-term shareholders. Section 16 officers have five years from the time they are promoted, named to a senior leadership position or their ownership requirement is increased to achieve the ownership levels set forth in our stock ownership           guidelines. The stock ownership levels currently applicable to our Section 16 officers and non-employee directors under these guidelines are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Level   Guideline  
 President and CEO   3.0× base salary  
 Other Section 16 Officers   2.0× base salary  
 Non-Employee Directors   3.0× base annual retainer  
[END TABLE]
A Section 16 officer's stock ownership requirement is based upon the officer's salary as of the date the           guidelines were adopted or, if later, as of the date the officer first became subject to the guidelines. As of any date, the share value for shares owned will be the greater of the fair market value of the shares as of that date or the Section 16           officer's or non-employee director's cost basis in those shares.
The ownership requirement is based on actual ownership, which includes (i) all shares beneficially owned, but           excluding unexercised stock options or unvested equity awards and, (ii) shares held in trust or other entity where the officer or Board member retains beneficial ownership.
The Compensation Committee and the Board review compliance with the guidelines at least           annually. If a director or executive officer fails to comply with the guidelines, the Committee and/or the Board may (i) limit future equity awards, (ii) require retention of portions of future equity exercises or shares that have vested or           (iii) pay future bonus amounts or Board retainers in stock. As of March 2019, when these ownership guidelines were adopted, each of our non-employee directors and named executive officers who have held their current title for at least three years           had met their respective stock ownership requirements with the exception of Mr. Caldwell who intends to meet this guideline during 2019.
Pay Ratio
The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the           ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of our other employees. We determine our median employee based on salary (annualized in the case of full and part-time employees           (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) as of December 31, 2018. The annual total compensation of our median employee (other than the Chief Executive Officer) for 2018 was $46,604. As disclosed in the Summary Compensation table appearing on page           24, our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation for 2018 was $673,887. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all           other employees was 14.5 to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between           companies.
Impact of Tax and Accounting
As a general matter, the Compensation Committee takes into account the various tax and accounting           implications of the compensation vehicles employed by the Company.
Accounting Impact
When determining amounts of long-term incentive grants to executives and employees, the Compensation           Committee examines the accounting cost associated with the grants. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, grants of equity-based awards result in an accounting charge for the Company equal to the grant date fair value of those securities.
Tax Impact
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code does not permit publicly traded companies to take income tax           deductions for compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer and the other Named Executive Officers (other than the Chief Financial Officer) to the extent that compensation exceeds $1.0 million per officer in any taxable year.
The Compensation Committee will continue to consider steps that might be in the Company's best interests to           comply with Section 162(m) of the Code. However, in establishing the cash and equity incentive compensation programs for the executive officers, the Compensation Committee believes that the potential deductibility of the compensation payable under those programs should be only one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration,           and not the sole or primary factor. The Compensation Committee believes that cash and equity incentive compensation must be maintained at the requisite level to attract and retain the executive officers essential to the Company's financial           success, even if all or part of that compensation may not be deductible by reason of the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code provides that severance payments triggered by a change in           control, which equal or exceed three times the individual's "base amount" are deemed to be "excess parachute payments." Individuals receiving parachute payments in excess of three times their base amount are subject to a 20% excise tax on the           amount of the excess payments. If excess parachute payments are made, the Company and the Bank would not be entitled to deduct the amount of the excess payments. Each employment agreement provides that severance and other payments that are           subject to a change in control will be reduced as much as necessary to ensure that no amounts payable to the executive will be considered excess parachute payments. COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the "Compensation           Discussion and Analysis" for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy           statement.
The foregoing report is furnished by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

Equity Incentive Plans
Our 2008 Stock Option and Incentive Plan is a stock-based compensation plan designed to           reward directors, regional (advisory) directors, officers and employees for service with a proprietary interest in the Company and to encourage such individuals to remain with the Company.  It provides for the award of stock options or stock appreciation rights for up to 352,741 shares of our common stock and provides for the award of incentive stock options to qualifying employees under           the federal tax laws.  The Compensation Committee administers this plan, determines employee eligibility, grants awards and sets the terms of awards.  Awards are discretionary and are based on an assessment of the participant's position, years of           service, and contribution to the success and growth of the Company.  The exercise price of options awarded must be no less than the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.  Options that are not exercisable           become immediately exercisable at the time of a change in control or of a tender or exchange offer for the Company's shares.  Upon any termination of service, unexercised options remain exercisable for the lesser of three months or the remaining           term of the option and all unvested options are lost.  This plan has been in place for 10 years.  As a result, no more shares may be awarded under the plan.
The Board has approved a new 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval to provide for the           availability of stock awards in keeping with the Company's strategy of attracting and retaining directors, officers and employees. Please see Proposal III on pages 36 to 45. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

Non-Equity Incentive Plans
In March 2018, based on a recommendation from its Compensation Committee, the Board of           Directors of the Company approved the MutualBank 2018 Executive Variable Compensation Plan, which provided for cash incentive payments to designated executives of the Company, including the five named executive officers.  This cash incentive plan           provides for one-time payments to the designated executives based on the Company's 2018 Basic EPS.  Under the plan, cash payments would be calculated as a percentage of 2018 base salary, with the appropriate percentage determined by whether a           targeted Basic EPS level was met for 2018.  For the named executive officers of the Company, the plan established seven designated Basic EPS levels (including the Company's target Basic EPS based on its 2018 budget) based upon internal forecasts           for the performance of the Company and a range of percentage of salary cash incentive payments for meeting these designated Basic EPS levels based upon each officer's anticipated contribution to that performance as follows:

 Christopher D. Cook     $256,000     8.0% to 40.0%  
 Patrick C. Botts     $340,000     10.0% to 50.0%  
 Charles J. Viater     $316,000     8.0% to 40.0%  
 Christopher L. Caldwell     $206,000     3.5% to 35.0%  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Basic EPS for 2018 was $2.25, which was a Basic EPS level that entitled           the named executive officers to a cash payment under the plan.  Messrs. Heeter, Cook, Botts, Viater and Caldwell qualified for an incentive cash payment of 45%, 30%, 35%, 30% and 25%, respectively of his 2018 base salary.  The Compensation           Committee and the Board determined that payments at that level were appropriate and awarded Messrs. Heeter, Cook, Botts, Viater and Caldwell cash payments of $187,187; $77,166, $119,729; $95,251 and $51,794 respectively, for 2018, which payments           were made in early 2019.
In March 2019, based on a recommendation from its Compensation Committee, the Board of           Directors of the Company approved a draft of the MutualBank Executive Variable Compensation Plan, which provides for annual cash incentive payments to designated executives of the Company, including its five named executive officers.  This cash           incentive plan provides for potential one-time payments to the designated executives based on the Company's Basic EPS for each year.  Under the plan, cash payments are calculated as a percentage of base salary for the year, with the appropriate           percentage determined by whether and what targeted Basic EPS level is met that year.  Each year, the Compensation Committee designates the Basic EPS targets based upon internal forecasts for the performance of the Company and related percentage           of salary bonuses levels based upon each officer's anticipated contribution to that performance for the current year.  For the named executive officers of the Company in 2019, the Compensation Committee established seven designated Basic EPS           levels (one of which is based on the Company's 2019 target performance) and a range of percentage of salary cash incentive payments for meeting each Basic EPS level as follows:

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The Bank maintains an executive deferral program for the           benefit of designated senior executives, including Messrs. Heeter and Botts, to supplement their retirement earnings to provide them with approximately another 10% of their expected salary at retirement as additional annual retirement income,           after Social Security benefits, ESOP shares and income from all retirement plans of the Bank, to the extent they chose to participate in the program.  Pursuant to the agreements under the program, key executives have been provided an additional           opportunity to defer, at their choice, 1% to 15% of their base salary into a non-qualified deferral program.  For each participant, the Bank matched $.50 of every dollar deferred, up to a maximum match established in each person's agreement.  The           Bank also pays interest on each account at a rate of 10%, which rate was set at the inception of the plan in 1993 and was not an above-market rate at that time.  Matching contributions and interest vest over five years.  The Bank maintains a           record of all amounts deferred by the executive.  Benefits are paid to the executives when they reach age 65.  The deferred compensation benefit is the annuitized value, at 10%, of the executive's account, which value is paid in monthly installments over 15 years.  The plan provides for earlier payouts for           disability and for continued payouts as death benefits.  Deferrals under this plan ceased after 2008; however, annual earnings at 10% continue.  For the year ending December 31, 2018, the aggregate earnings accrued for Messrs. Heeter and Botts on           their deferred compensation balances (a portion of which also is reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table) were $34,305 and $26,314, respectively.

Retirement Plans
The Company has designed retirement plans or programs to ensure our employees have           adequate income levels after employment.  Prior to July 2009, the Company maintained a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, in which the Compensation Committee determined the amount of Company contributions for all employees.  The Company also           maintained an ESOP designed to ensure all employees have a vested interest in the success of the Company.  The ESOP purchased shares of the Company's stock in 1999, which were allocated to employees annually over 15 years.  On July 1, 2009, these           two qualified plans were combined into a KSOP.  This reduced our administrative expenses and provides employee compensation tied to the success of the Company.  Under the KSOP, in addition to the regular ESOP allocations, employee contributions           are matched.
The Company also maintains a non-qualified Executive Benefit Plan ("Benefit Plan") for key employees,           including Messrs. Heeter and Botts.  The Benefit Plan is designed to provide the executives with retirement income, in conjunction with Social Security and the KSOP, of approximately 60% of their pre-retirement income.  An estimated annual           retirement payment is established based on the individual's anticipated salary at retirement, estimates of the person's retirement income from Social Security benefits, all tax qualified plans of the Bank and an assumed 8% annual rate of return.            This estimated payment amount is reviewed periodically for changes in the relevant factors.
The Bank makes an annual payment to each participant for the purpose of funding the cost of their future           benefit.  Those contributions are taxable income to the participant in the year they are made and are reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
Under the Benefit Plan, if the executive is involuntarily terminated other than for cause or in connection           with a change in control, the Bank must make a lump sum contribution to the executive of the full contribution for the then-current year and the present value, based on an 8% rate, of the next five years of required contributions (or of all           required remaining contributions if less).  In addition, if the executive is deemed to be terminated in connection with a change of control, the Bank must make a lump sum final contribution to the executive's account equal to the present value, at 8%, of all remaining contributions required under then-current payout estimates, through age 65.
In the 2008 acquisition of another financial institution, the Bank assumed the terms of the Salary           Continuation Agreement between that entity and Mr. Viater, which provides for an annual retirement benefit of $60,000 payable in monthly installments for 15 years if he retires at the age of 60 or later.  Any payments made upon a change in           control are subject to reduction to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 280G.  
Employment Agreements
The Bank has entered into three-year employment agreements with Messrs. Heeter, Cook,           Botts and Viater which provide for annual one-year extensions, if authorized by the Compensation Committee and the Board.  Under these agreements, each executive's salary is reviewed for adjustments annually and cannot be decreased below any           adjusted level.  The 2018 base salaries of Messrs. Heeter, Cook, Botts and Viater under these agreements are $414,000, $256,000, $340,000 and $316,000, respectively.  Under these agreements, each executive is entitled to participate equitably in           discretionary bonuses awarded to executive employees and in the Bank's other employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, group life, disability and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits.  Each agreement provides that the           executive's employment may be terminated by the Bank or by the executive at any time and also provides for termination upon the occurrence of certain events specified by federal regulations.  If the executive's employment is terminated due to           disability, he would receive his salary and other benefits for the remainder of the three-year term, with a reduction in his salary for disability insurance payments from insurance purchased by the Bank.  If the executive's employment is           terminated due to death, his estate would receive all benefits under the agreement through the end of the month in which the executive dies.  If the executive's employment is terminated for cause or voluntarily by the executive, he would receive           all benefits under the agreement through that termination date.  If the executive's employment is terminated by constructive termination, with no change in control, the Bank would be required to pay to the executive his then-current salary over           the three-year term and to provide the executive with his then-current employee health benefits for the remaining term of his agreement.  If the executive's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control, MutualBank           must pay to the executive in a lump sum 299% of his Section 280G base amount (the base amount is essentially the executive's average annual Box 1, W-2 compensation during the five full calendar year periods prior to the effective date of the           termination) and continue to provide substantially the same health benefits as were being provided to the executive officers of MutualBank immediately prior to the change in control, in each case subject to reduction to ensure deductibility under           Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  The executives have no responsibility to mitigate amounts owed to them under the agreements nor does any compensation received from another employer reduce post-termination compensation under the           agreements.  The agreements provide that for the three years following any termination of employment, each officer will be prohibited from soliciting Company or           Bank depositors, customers and employees to leave the Company or the Bank.
Change in Control Agreement
The Bank entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Caldwell on October 15,           2017 which provides for annual one-year extensions, if authorized by the Compensation Committee and the Board. Under the agreement, if Mr. Caldwell's employment is terminated within twelve months subsequent to a Change in Control for any reason           other than for cause, disability, retirement or as a result of Mr. Caldwell's death, or if Mr. Caldwell resigns for good reason as a result of any material breach of the change in control agreement by Mr. Caldwell's employer or as a result of a           material change in the location where Mr. Caldwell works, Mr. Caldwell will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to his annual compensation plus the cost of his benefits over a twelve month period including the cost of all group insurance,           life insurance, health and accident and disability insurance and any other benefit plan program or insurance he was entitled to participate in immediately prior to his termination. In the event of his termination, Mr. Caldwell would be entitled           to receive $277,957 based on his compensation for 2018.
In the 2008 acquisition of another financial institution, the Bank also assumed Mr.           Viater's director fee continuation agreement, which provides that if he retires after attaining age 65 and continues to serve as a director for at least five years, he would be entitled to an annual retirement benefit for 10 years equal to 50% of           any director fees paid to him during the last plan year before ending service.  In the event of a change in control followed within 24 months by a termination of service as a director prior to age 72, the director would be entitled to receive the           present value of the normal retirement benefit (without regard to years of service) paid in a lump sum. Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control
The following tables show the approximate value of the benefits and payments that the Named Executive           Officers would have been entitled to receive as of December 31, 2018 had their employment been terminated or had a change in control occurred on that date. The table excludes (i) amounts accrued through December 31, 2018 that would be paid in the           normal course of continued employment, such as accrued but unpaid salary and bonus amounts, (ii) vested account balances under the Company's KSOP plan, and (iii) already vested equity awards.

 PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) RESOLUTION TO
APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Our stockholders have been presented with a say-on-pay proposal for over a decade at our           Annual Meetings and have approved our executive compensation at these annual meetings by a significant percentage of the votes cast.  We are presenting for a vote at the Annual Meeting an advisory, (non-binding) stockholder resolution to approve           the compensation of our executives, as described in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
This (non-binding) advisory resolution will be presented at the Annual Meeting as           follows:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive           officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
This vote will not be binding on the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation           Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  It also will not affect any compensation already paid or awarded to any executive.  The Compensation           Committee and the Board will consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.  At last year's annual meeting, over 90% of the shares voting on a similar (non-binding) resolution voted to approve the           Company's compensation to executives.  Because of this level of approval, the vote had no specific influence on the Company's compensation practices in 2018.
As disclosed in more detail in "Executive Compensation – Philosophy and Objective of           Compensation Programs," the Compensation Committee has a very deliberate and thoughtful process for establishing a broad-based compensation program for our executives and believes that a well-structured compensation program should align the           interests of our executives with those of the stockholders and include components that drive the creation of sustainable stockholder value over the long-term and do not simply focus on short-term gains.  Our compensation program seeks to help the           Company and the Bank attract, motivate and retain talented and dedicated executives, orient its executives toward the achievement of business goals, and link the compensation of its executives to the Company's success.  Executive compensation           determinations are a complex and demanding process.  The Compensation Committee exercises great care and discipline in its analysis and decision-making and recognizes our stockholders' interest in executive compensation practices.  The           Compensation Committee seeks to establish compensation levels that attract highly effective executives who work well as a team and whose values are aligned with our corporate values to conduct our business with character, compassion and class and           to compete effectively.  A primary focus of our compensation program has been to compensate actual performance, using realistic incentive thresholds.
Therefore, our overriding principles in setting types and amounts of compensation are:           (1) to link individual compensation to the successful achievement of performance objectives; (2) to attract, retain and motivate our top performers at a competitive level in our market; (3) to align the interests of key executives with those of           our stockholders in furtherance of our goal to improve stockholder value; (4) to ensure that our incentive compensation does not encourage incurring excessive risk; and (5) to comply with any applicable regulatory compensation limits.  In setting           executive compensation and benefits in line with this philosophy, the Compensation Committee has established a full compensation package that includes base salary, annual incentive bonus compensation, retirement benefits, equity compensation,           perquisites and other benefits.
The Company's Board of Directors recommends that           stockholders vote FOR the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve executive compensation. PROPOSAL 3
PROPOSAL III.  APPROVAL OF THE 2019 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN
Introduction
On March 20, 2019, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, our           Board of Directors approved the Company's 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"), subject to approval by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting. The 2019 Plan will only become effective if it is approved by the Company's           stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
The purpose of the 2019 Plan is to promote the long-term success, and enhance the           long-term value, of the Company by linking the personal interests of employees and directors with those of the Company's stockholders. The 2019 Plan is further intended to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to motivate, attract,           and retain the services of employees and directors upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful conduct of its operation largely is dependent, in a manner that does not expose the Company to imprudent risks and that is           consistent with the long-term health of the Company.
We currently have one equity-based incentive plan in effect, the Company's 2008 Stock           Option and Incentive Plan (the "Existing Plan"), which provides for awards to employees, officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. If our stockholders approve the           2019 Plan, no further awards can be made under the Existing Plan, and shares of Common Stock reserved to make new awards under that plan will be released; shares of Common Stock reserved to fund issued and outstanding awards under the Existing           Plan and our prior equity incentive plans will continue to be reserved for those awards. All awards outstanding under the Existing Plan and our prior equity incentive plans will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms and will continue           to be governed solely by the terms of the documents evidencing such awards, and no provision of the 2019 Plan will be deemed to affect or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of such awards with respect to their acquisition           of shares.
Reasons for Seeking Stockholder Approval of the 2019 Plan
We use equity compensation as a key tool for attracting, retaining and motivating the           best available talent. Our stockholders have previously authorized a total of 352,741 shares of Common Stock for awards under the Existing Plan. As of March 20, 2019 (the latest practicable date prior to the mailing of this proxy statement),           189,862 shares were subject to outstanding awards under the Existing Plan and our prior equity incentive plans and no shares remain available for future awards under the Existing Plan. We believe approval of the 2019 Plan is critical to ensuring           that we have adequate shares available to attract, retain and motivate top talent.
Certain Considerations
Burn Rate;               Longevity of Authorized Shares. Burn rate, which is a measure of the rate at which companies use (or burn) shares available for grant in their equity compensation plans, is an important factor for investors concerned about           stockholder dilution. The burn rate is defined in terms of the gross number of equity awards granted during a calendar year divided by the weighted average of number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year. The Company's burn rate           over the last three years is 0.0% as the Company hasn't awarded options since 2012. The Company's burn rate for the three year period between 2010 and 2012 was 1.82%. We believe our current three-year average burn rate of 0.0% should be viewed           favorably by our stockholders. However, we note that the Committee intends to increase its utilization of performance-based awards in the near future.
Although our future annual share usage will depend upon and be influenced by a number of           factors, such as the number of plan participants, the price per share of our Common Stock and the methodology used to establish the equity award mix, the 600,000 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will enable us to           continue to utilize equity awards as an important component of our compensation program and help meet our objectives to attract, retain and incentivize talented personnel. The calculation of the share reserve took into account, among other           things: (i) the effect the acquisitions over the previous ten years have had on our size and employee head count, (ii) our stock price and volatility, (iii) our share burn rate and overhang, (iv) the existing terms of our outstanding awards, and           (v) our proposed fungible share rate of 2-for-1 for full value awards (stock-based awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights) under the 2019 Plan. The results of this           analysis were presented to our Compensation Committee for their consideration. In addition, we anticipate that the fungible share design will permit a more efficient and effective use of those shares for future equity awards. Upon approval of the           proposal, based on the factors described above, we estimate that the pool of shares available under the 2019 Plan would last for approximately four to six years.
Plan Cost. Another metric often used by investors to assess the appropriateness of the number of shares to be authorized for issuance under an equity plan is the           cost of the shares relative to the current outstanding shares of the Company. The 600,000 shares being requested will represent 7% of the approximately 8.6 million shares outstanding as of the date of this proxy statement. Although our current           practice has been to grant a significant portion of the awards as options, to the extent we grant full value awards, the number of the additional shares which will actually be issued will be less, because each share issued under full value awards           counts on a 2-for-1 basis against the number of shares authorized for issuance according to the plan. For example, this means that, for every 100 shares of restricted stock issued by us under the 2019 Plan, the number of shares available under           the 2019 Plan will be reduced by 200 shares. We believe these facts should be viewed favorably by investors as they demonstrate that the cost of our 2019 Plan is reasonable.
Overhang.           Overhang is another measure that is sometimes used to assess the dilutive impact of equity programs such as the 2019 Plan. Overhang indicates the amount by which existing stockholder ownership would be diluted if the shares authorized for           issuance under our Existing Plan, coupled with the shares subject to outstanding awards under the Existing Plan and our prior equity incentive plans, were issued. As of March 4, 2019, the overhang represented by the number of outstanding awards           plus shares available for issuance under the Existing Plan stood at 2%. The additional 600,000 shares to be authorized under the 2019 Plan (taking into account that no further grants will be made under the Existing Plan if stockholders approve           the 2019 Plan) will result in an overhang of between 6% and 9%, depending on the mix of awards. We believe these levels of overhang should not be viewed as excessive by investors.
The following description sets forth the material terms of the 2019 Plan. It does not           purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2019 Plan, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A.
Corporate Governance Practices
The 2019 Plan incorporates the following provisions that enable us to maintain sound corporate governance           practices in granting equity-based awards to employees and directors that we believe are consistent with the interests of stockholders, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limit on Shares Authorized: Based on our current three-year average burn                          rate, we believe that the shares authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan would be sufficient to make awards for four to six years following approval of the 2019 Plan by stockholders.  
• Limit on Shares Issued for Full Value Awards: The 2019 Plan limits the number                          of shares which may be issued under full value awards (awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights). Under the 2019 Plan, utilizing shares for full value awards has the effect of reducing the aggregate shares                          available for issuance on a 2-for-1 basis. Although our past grant practices have been to award stock options, to the extent a portion of awards are full value awards (for example, time or performance-based restricted stock), the                          actual number of shares that will be issued will be less than the number of shares authorized for issuance. In the event all awards granted under the 2019 Plan are full value awards, then the actual number of shares to be issued                          will be 300,000.  
• Annual Limit on Director Awards: The 2019 Plan limits the number of shares of                          Common Stock that may be subject to awards to non-employee directors. Not more than 10,000 shares may be issuable under awards made to a non-employee director in any one calendar year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Share Recycling Provisions: The 2019 Plan provides that the                          following shares may not be added back (recycled) to the aggregate plan limit: (1) shares tendered in payment of the option exercise price; (2) shares withheld by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations; and (3) shares                          that are repurchased by the Company with proceeds from option exercises. The 2019 Plan expressly provides that the gross number of stock appreciation rights exercised or settled, in stock and not just the net shares issued upon                          exercise or settlement, count against the aggregate limit on the number of shares which may be issued under the 2019 Plan.  
• Minimum Vesting and Restricted Period. Not more than 5% of the shares                          authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan may be issued with time-vested award schedules that fully vest in less than one year from the grant date (three years for the chief executive officer).  
• No Discount Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights: The 2019 Plan                          prohibits the grant of stock options or stock appreciation rights with an exercise or grant price less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. Fair market value is the closing price of the Common Stock                          on the date of grant.  
• No Repricing of Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights: The 2019 Plan                          prohibits the repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval. It also prohibits the exchange of underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights for cash or a different award without                          stockholder approval.  
• "Double-Trigger" Vesting on Change in Control: A change in control does not,                          by itself, trigger full vesting of awards under the 2019 Plan. The continuing awards or replacement awards will continue under their pre-change in control vesting and other terms, except that full vesting will occur in the event the                          participant's employment is involuntarily terminated within two years following a change in control (the occurrence of the "double trigger").  
• Protective Provisions: The 2019 Plan authorizes the Committee (as defined                          below under "-Administration of the 2019 Plan") to include clawback, holding period or other protective provisions in the terms of any award. Clawback provisions enable the Company to recover amounts which were paid or earned based                          upon financial statements or other metrics which subsequently prove to be erroneous. Holding period requirements mandate that participants retain earned shares in order to further link their interests to the long-term interests of                          the stockholders. Other protective provisions, such as conditioning an award upon the participant's consent to restrictive covenants, are additional ways through which participants' interests and those of the Company can be aligned.  
• No Dividend Equivalents Paid on Unvested Performance Awards or on Options and SARs: The                              2019 Plan prohibits payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on performance share awards until those awards are earned and vested. It also prohibits the granting of dividends or dividend equivalents on Options and SARs.  
• Material Amendments to the Plan Require Stockholder Approval: The 2019 Plan                          provides that a material amendment to the plan will not be effective unless approved by the Company's stockholders.  
• Independent Committee Administration: The 2019 Plan is to be administered by                          a committee of the Company's board of directors comprised entirely of independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
Awards, Shares Authorized and Limitations
The 2019 Plan provides for the grant to employees and directors of the Company and its           subsidiaries (whom we refer to collectively as "participants") the following types of awards:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which may be either "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (which                          we refer to as "incentive stock options") or non-statutory options which do not satisfy the provisions of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (which we refer to as "non-qualified stock options") (incentive stock options and                          non-qualified stock options are together referred to as "stock options" or "options");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock appreciation rights;  
     restricted stock and restricted stock units; and  
• performance shares and performance units.  
[END TABLE]
Subject to adjustment as described under "- Changes in Capitalization," the total number           of shares available for awards under the 2019 Plan will be 600,000. Shares issued under the 2019 Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares, or shares that have been reacquired by the Company. Shares subject to awards which terminate,           expire or lapse are again available for awards under the 2019 Plan.
The 2019 Plan sets forth annual limits with respect to awards which may be granted to a           participant. A participant may receive different types of awards during a calendar year. Under the 2019 Plan, subject to adjustment as described in "Changes in Capitalization," awards granted during a calendar year to any one participant are           subject to the following limitations: (1) aggregate grants of stock options or stock appreciation rights are subject to an annual limit of 50,000 shares; (2) aggregate grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units are subject to an annual           limit of 25,000 shares; and (3) aggregate grants of performance shares or performance units are subject to an annual limit of 25,000 shares. In addition, the aggregate number of shares that may be credited as director compensation and/or covered           by awards to a non-employee director with respect to a calendar year is subject to an annual limit of 10,000 shares. The 2019 Plan provides that up to 550,000 of the shares available for award under the Plan may be issued as incentive stock           options.
Changes in Capitalization
The 2019 Plan provides that in the event of any reorganization, recapitalization,           reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, distribution, contribution of shares, merger consideration, rights offering or any other changes in corporate structure or shares of the Company, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of           participant rights under the 2019 Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance, available for issuance or covered by any outstanding award and the exercise price or other per share amounts applicable to any such award, and           the various limitations described above, may be adjusted by the Committee. Fractional shares will not be issued under the 2019 Plan.
Eligibility
Any employee or director (including advisory and emeritus directors) of the Company or           any of its subsidiaries is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 539 employees, including 40 part-time employees and 10 non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Administration of the 2019 Plan
The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors           (which we refer to in this section as the "Committee"). Each director of the Committee qualifies as (i) a "Non-Employee Director," as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (ii) an "Independent Director" under the           Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Committee members serve at the discretion of the Company's board of directors and may be removed by the board at any time.
The Committee generally has full power to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determine the size and types of awards;  
• determine the terms and conditions of awards in a manner consistent with the 2019 Plan;  
• interpret the 2019 Plan and any agreement or instrument entered into under the 2019 Plan;  
• establish, amend or waive rules and regulations for the administration of the 2019 Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amend or otherwise modify the 2019 Plan or, subject to the limitations set forth in the Plan, the terms and conditions of any outstanding award under the 2019                          Plan;  
• make all other determinations which are necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2019 Plan; and  
• delegate its authority under the 2019 Plan to the extent permitted by law, rule or regulation.  
[END TABLE]
Duration and Modification
The 2019 Plan will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with its terms;           however, no award may be made under the 2019 Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of its approval by the Company's stockholders. The Company's board of directors or the Committee generally may, at any time, terminate, amend or modify the 2019           Plan without approval of participants or the Company's stockholders. Stockholder approval must be obtained if it is required by law, rule or regulation. As a result, stockholder approval will generally be required for material amendments to the           2019 Plan, such as amendments to increase the number of shares which may be issued under awards. Additionally, the Company's board of directors, in its discretion, may voluntarily seek stockholder approval if it so desires.
No Repricing Without Stockholder Approval
Stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be repriced, replaced or regranted           through cancellation, exchanged for cash or other awards or by lowering the exercise or grant price of a previously granted stock option or stock appreciation right (other than as described under "- Changes in Capitalization"), except with the           approval of the Company's stockholders.
Stock Options
General. Stock options may be granted to employees and directors at any time and from time to time by the Committee. The Committee has broad discretion in           determining the number of shares subject to options granted to each participant. Each option grant is evidenced by an option agreement that specifies the exercise price, the duration of the option, the number of shares to which the option           pertains, the vesting schedule, and such other provisions as the Committee determines. In addition, the option agreement specifies whether the option was intended to be an incentive stock option or a non-qualified stock option. The exercise price           must not be less than the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant, provided that the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a holder of more than ten percent of the Common Stock must not be less than 110%           of fair market value on the date of grant. The duration of a stock option may not exceed ten years, provided that the duration of an incentive stock option granted to a holder of more than ten percent of the Common Stock may not exceed five           years.
Stock Option               Exercises. A participant may pay the exercise price of his or her option in cash, by delivering shares of Common Stock that he or she           already owns having a total market value equal to the total exercise price, through a broker-assisted (cashless) exercise, by net settlement, or by a combination of cash and shares.
Exercising               Options After Termination of Employment or Service. The termination of a participant's employment or service as a director affects his           or her ability to exercise options granted under the 2019 Plan as discussed in more detail below.
Termination of               Service or Employment-General. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's option agreement or as described below, if a participant's employment or service terminates, any portion of the participant's option which has not yet           vested will be forfeited, unless the Committee decides to waive this forfeiture and allow the participant to exercise that portion (in addition to the already vested portion) of the option. Thereafter, unless otherwise provided in the           participant's option agreement, the exercisable portion of the participant's option may be exercised for three months after the date of termination or until the expiration date of the option, whichever period is shorter. Unless otherwise set           forth in the participant's option agreement, should the participant die during the shorter of these two periods, the participant's option may be exercised by the participant's designated beneficiary (or, if no beneficiary has been designated, by such person or persons who have acquired the participant's           rights under the option by will or the laws of descent and distribution) for one year after the participant's death.
Termination Due               to Death. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's option agreement, if a participant's employment or service is terminated due to death, any unvested portion of the participant's option will immediately become exercisable           and the option may be exercised  by the participant's designated beneficiary (or, if no beneficiary has been designated, by such person or persons who have acquired the participant's rights under the option by will or the laws of descent and           distribution) for one year after the participant's death.
Termination Due               to Disability. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's option agreement, if a participant's employment or service is terminated due to permanent and total disability, any unvested portion of the participant's option will           immediately become exercisable and the option may be exercised for one year after the date of termination or until the expiration date of the option, whichever period is shorter. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's option agreement,           should the participant die during the shorter of these two periods, the participant's option may be exercised by the participant's designated beneficiary (or, if no beneficiary has been designated, by such person or persons who have acquired the           participant's rights under the options by will or the laws of descent and distribution) for one year after the participant's death.
Termination Due               to Cause. If a participant's employment or service is terminated for cause, all of his or her outstanding options under the 2019 Plan (regardless of vesting status) will immediately be forfeited.
Transferability. Except as otherwise permitted by the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, no incentive stock option may be sold,           transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than, upon the participant's death, to the participant's designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary has been properly designated by the participant, by will or by the           laws of descent and distribution. An incentive stock option may be transferred incident to a divorce (within the meaning of Section 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code) or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, but such a transfer will           cause the incentive stock option to become a non-qualified stock option as of the day of the transfer. An incentive stock option may be transferred to a grantor trust under which the participant is considered the sole beneficial owner of the           incentive stock option while it is held by the trust. No non-qualified stock option may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than (1) upon the participant's death, to the participant's designated           beneficiary or, if no beneficiary has been properly designated by the participant, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, (2) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (3) to a grantor trust, or (4) if specified by the           Committee in the participant's option agreement, by gift to any member of the participant's immediate family or to a trust for the benefit of the participant or one or more of the participant's immediate family members. For these purposes, a           participant's "immediate family" means the participant, and the lineal ascendants and lineal descendants of the participant or his or her spouse, or any one or more of them. Unless transferred as permitted under the 2019 Plan, a stock option may           be exercised during the participant's lifetime only by the participant.
Stock Appreciation Rights
The exercise of a stock appreciation right entitles its holder to receive in cash,           shares of Common Stock or a combination of both (as determined by the Committee), an amount equal to (1) the difference between the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant (exercise) price, multiplied           by (2) the number of shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised.
Stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and directors at any time and from           time to time as determined by the Committee. The Committee has broad discretion in establishing the terms of stock appreciation rights, including the number of shares subject to a particular award, conditions to exercising, grant price (which           must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant) and duration of the award (which may not exceed ten years). A stock appreciation right may be related to a stock option or be granted           independently of any option. In the case of a stock appreciation right that is related to a stock option, the exercise of one award will reduce, on a one-to-one basis, the number of shares covered by the other award. The plan provisions on           exercising stock appreciation rights after termination of employment or service and transferability of stock appreciation rights are essentially the same as those applicable to stock options. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
General. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be granted to employees and directors at any time and from time to time by the           Committee. Each restricted stock or restricted stock unit grant is evidenced by a restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement that specifies the period of restriction (that is, the period during which the entitlement of the participant           under the award is limited in some way or subject to forfeiture) and any other vesting terms, the number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted, and such other provisions as the Committee may determine, including whether           the award is subject to vesting upon the achievement of performance goals. Each restricted stock unit agreement will also specify the time at which, after vesting, the award will be settled (i.e., paid out to the participant) and the form in           which settlement will be made (i.e., in shares of Common Stock, in cash, or a combination of both). In addition, the Committee may require that a participant pay a stipulated purchase price for each share of restricted stock or restricted stock           unit, or impose holding requirements or sale restrictions upon vesting of restricted stock or settlement of restricted stock units in shares.
The 2019 Plan does not prescribe a specific period over which shares of restricted stock           and restricted stock units generally must vest. During the period of restriction, a participant holding shares of restricted stock may exercise full voting rights with respect to those shares, and also is entitled to receive all dividends and           distributions paid with respect to those shares while they are held. The Committee may provide that payment of such dividends shall not be made until the underlying restricted stock vests. If any dividends or distributions are paid in shares of           Common Stock, those shares will be subject to the same restrictions as the shares of restricted stock with respect to which they were paid. A participant has no voting or dividend rights with respect to shares underlying restricted stock units           unless and until the shares are issued to the participant in settlement of the restricted stock units. The Committee may, however, provide in the participant's restricted stock unit agreement for the crediting of dividend equivalent units.
Termination of               Service or Employment. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement, if a           participant's employment or service is terminated due to death or permanent and total disability, the period of restriction will lapse as of the date of termination. Unless otherwise set forth in the participant's restricted stock or restricted           stock unit agreement, if a participant's employment or service is terminated for any other reason, all unvested shares awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units will immediately be forfeited unless the termination is not for cause           and the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines to provide for the lapsing of all or a portion of the unvested shares or restricted stock units.
Transferability. Shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units generally may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated           until the end of the applicable period of restriction (and in the case of restricted stock units, until the date of delivery or other payment), or upon earlier satisfaction of any other conditions, as specified by the Committee in its sole           discretion and set forth in the restricted stock or restricted stock unit agreement.
Performance Shares and Performance Units
General. Performance shares and performance units may be granted to employees and directors at any time and from time to time by the Committee, entitling the           participant to future cash payments, shares of Common Stock or a combination of both, based upon the level of achievement with respect to one or more pre-established performance goals over a specified performance period.
The Committee will establish a maximum amount of a participant's award, denominated in           shares of Common Stock, in the case of performance shares, or units, in the case of performance units. Each award of performance shares or performance units will be evidenced by a performance share or performance unit agreement, which will set           forth (1) the target and maximum amount payable to the participant, (2) the performance goals and level of achievement versus these goals that will determine the amount of payment, (3) the performance period as to which performance will be           measured, (4) the timing of any payment earned by virtue of performance, (5) whether and the extent to which participants holding performance shares or performance units will receive dividends or dividend equivalents, (6) restrictions on the           alienation or transfer of the award prior to actual payment and restrictions on the sale or transfer of shares following actual payment of an award paid in shares, (7) forfeiture provisions and (8) such other terms as may be determined by the           Committee. After the end of each performance period, the Committee will determine the extent to           which performance goals have been attained, and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions. The Committee will determine what, if any, payment is due with respect to an award and, in the case of performance units, whether the payment will           be made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of both. Payment will be made in a lump sum within 60 days after the Committee determines that a payment is due. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount paid under           an award of performance shares or performance units on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations may be reduced by the Committee in its discretion, if the terms of the award so provide.
Termination of               Employment or Service. Unless provided otherwise in the participant's agreement evidencing his or her award of performance shares or           performance units, if the employment or service of a participant terminates before the end of a performance period due to death or permanent and total disability, then to the extent it is determined by the Committee following the end of the           performance period that the performance goals have been attained, the participant will be entitled to a pro rata payment based on the number of months' service during the performance period but based on the achievement of performance goals during           the entire performance period; payment under these circumstances will be made at the same time payments are made to participants who did not terminate service during the performance period. Unless provided otherwise in the participant's agreement           evidencing his or her award of performance shares or performance units, if the employment or service of a participant terminates before the end of a performance period for any other reason, all outstanding performance shares or performance units           awarded to the participant will be canceled; however, if the participant's employment or service is terminated by the Company other than for cause, the Committee in its sole discretion may waive the automatic cancellation provision and pay out on           a pro rata basis as described in the immediately preceding sentence.
Transferability. Except as otherwise provided in the participant's agreement evidencing his or her award of performance shares or performance units, performance shares           and performance units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than upon the participant's death, to the participant's designated beneficiary or, if no beneficiary has been designated by the           participant, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Change in Control
Under the 2019 Plan in the event of a change in control, to the extent that outstanding           awards under the Plan are assumed or replaced with a replacement award, such awards will not vest automatically (so-called "single-trigger" vesting), but instead remain outstanding and continue to be governed by their terms. However, if within           two years following a change in control, a participant is involuntarily terminated other than for cause (including voluntary resignation for good reason under an applicable plan or agreement), death or disability, then upon such termination the           awards will become fully vested (so-called "double-trigger" vesting). If the Committee determines that existing awards are not appropriately assumed or are not appropriately replaced in connection with a change in control, and unless otherwise           provided by the Committee in the agreement applicable to an award, upon a change in control:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each option and stock appreciation right then outstanding shall become fully vested and exercisable;  
• all restrictions on restricted stock will lapse and all restricted stock units will become fully-vested; and  
• each performance-based award will be deemed earned and shall be paid to the extent of the greater of (i) the                      extent, as determined by the Committee, to which the performance goals applicable to such performance-based award have been met during the applicable performance period up through and including the effective date of the change in                      control or (ii) the target number of performance shares or performance units determined at the date of grant.

Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following discussion is intended for the information of stockholders considering how           to vote on the proposed 2019 Plan, and not as tax guidance to plan participants. Under current U.S. federal income tax laws, awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and           performance units under the 2019 Plan will generally have the following federal income tax consequences: (1) The grant of a stock option will not, by itself, result in the recognition of           taxable income to the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of grant.
(2) If the participant exercises an incentive stock option, the exercise of the option           will generally not, by itself, result in the recognition of taxable income by the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of exercise. However, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the           shares of Common Stock acquired on the date of exercise is an item of adjustment included for purposes of calculating the participant's alternative minimum tax.
If the participant does not hold the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an           incentive stock option for at least one year after the exercise of the stock option or two years after the grant of the stock option, whichever is later, the participant will recognize ordinary (compensation) income upon disposition of the shares           in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise of the stock option and the exercise price. If this happens, the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction in the amount of           ordinary income, if any, that the participant recognizes, subject to the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The participant also will recognize a capital gain (loss) to the extent the sale price exceeds (is           less than) the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the stock option. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding deduction for any such capital gain. The capital gain (loss) will be characterized as           short-term if the participant does not hold the shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock option and long-term if the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock option.
If the participant holds the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an           incentive stock option for at least one year after the stock option is exercised and at least two years after the option is granted, the participant will recognize a capital gain (loss) upon disposition of the shares to the extent the sale price           exceeds (is less than) the exercise price. This capital gain (loss) will be characterized as long-term if the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock option. The Company will not be entitled to a           corresponding deduction for any such capital gain.
(3) If the participant exercises a non-qualified stock option, the participant will           recognize ordinary (compensation) income on the date of exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of exercise of the shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise and the exercise price of           the non-qualified stock option. The Company will be allowed a deduction in the amount of any ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise of the non-qualified stock option, subject to the deduction limitations under Section 162(m)           of the Internal Revenue Code. When the participant sells the shares acquired upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the participant will recognize a capital gain (loss) to the extent of any appreciation (depreciation) in the value of the           shares from the date of exercise to the date of sale. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding deduction for any such capital gain. The capital gain (loss) will be short-term if the participant does not hold the shares for more than           one year after the exercise of the stock option and long-term if the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock option.
(4) The grant of a stock appreciation right will not, by itself, result in the           recognition of taxable income to the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of grant. If the participant exercises a stock appreciation right, the participant will recognize ordinary (compensation) income on the date of           exercise in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value on the date of exercise of the shares of Common Stock underlying the stock appreciation right being exercised and the grant price of the stock appreciation right. The           Company will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction, subject to the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. To the extent the stock appreciation right is settled in shares of Common Stock, when the           participant sells the shares, the participant will recognize a capital gain (loss) to the extent of any appreciation (depreciation) in the value of the shares from the date of exercise. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding           deduction for any such capital gain. The capital gain (loss) will be short-term if the participant does not hold the shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock appreciation right and long-term if the participant does hold the           shares for more than one year after the exercise of the stock appreciation right.
(5) The grant of restricted stock will not, by itself, result in the recognition of           taxable income to the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of grant. Holders of shares of restricted stock will recognize ordinary (compensation) income on the date that the shares of restricted stock are no longer           subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares on that           date. A holder of restricted stock may generally elect under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to recognize ordinary income in the amount of the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on the date of grant. The Company will           be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder, subject to the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. When the participant disposes of shares granted as restricted           stock, the difference between the amount received by the participant upon the disposition and the fair market value of the shares on the date the participant recognized ordinary income will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The capital gain           or loss will be short-term if the participant does not hold the shares for more than one year after recognition of ordinary income and long-term if the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the recognition of ordinary           income. The holding period begins when the restricted stock vests, unless a Section 83(b) election is made, in which case the holding period begins upon the restricted stock grant date. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding           deduction for any such capital gain. Holders of restricted stock will also recognize ordinary income equal to any dividend income when such payments are received, even if the restricted stock remains subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
(6)  The grant of restricted stock units will not, by itself, result in the recognition           of taxable income to the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of grant. Upon settlement of the restricted stock units, the participant will generally recognize ordinary (compensation) income in the amount of the fair           market value of the shares of Common Stock and/or the amount of cash paid to the participant. The Company will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder, subject to the deduction limitations           under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. When the participant disposes of any shares of Common Stock paid upon settlement of the restricted stock units, the difference between the amount received by the participant upon the disposition           and the fair market value of the shares on the date the participant recognized ordinary income with respect to the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The capital gain or loss will be short-term if the participant does not hold the           shares for more than one year after recognition of ordinary income and long-term if the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the recognition of ordinary income. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding           deduction for any such capital gain.
(7) The grant of performance shares or performance units will not, by itself, result in           the recognition of taxable income to the participant or entitle the Company to a deduction at the time of grant. The participant will recognize ordinary (compensation) income, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, at the           time shares of Common Stock are delivered in payment of performance shares or shares of Common Stock and/or cash are delivered in payment of performance units. The amount of such ordinary income will be the amount of the fair market value of the           shares of Common Stock and/or the amount of cash delivered to the participant. The Company will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder, subject to the deduction limitations under Section           162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. When the participant disposes of any shares of Common Stock, the difference between the amount received by the participant upon the disposition and the fair market value of the shares on the date the           participant recognizes ordinary income will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The capital gain or loss will be short-term if the participant does not hold the shares for more than one year after recognition of ordinary income and long-term if           the participant does hold the shares for more than one year after the recognition of ordinary income. The Company will not be entitled to a corresponding deduction for any such capital gain.
Proposed Awards under the 2019 Plan
No awards have been proposed under the 2019 Plan as of the date of this proxy statement.
The Company's Board of Directors recommends that Stockholders Vote FOR the Approval of the           2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan. REPORT OF           THE AUDIT/COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE
The               following Report of the Audit/Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any             filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent MutualFirst specifically incorporates this             Report therein, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
The Audit/Compliance Committee of MutualFirst is comprised of the undersigned directors,           each of whom is independent as defined under the NASDAQ's listing standards.  The Audit/Compliance Committee's responsibilities are described in a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls, financial reporting           process and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  BKD, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with           generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report thereon.  As the members of the Audit/Compliance Committee, it is our responsibility to monitor and oversee these processes.
The Audit/Compliance Committee, in its oversight responsibility, reviews the services           performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and our policies and procedures for the engagement of that firm.  The Audit/Compliance Committee also discussed with the Company's internal auditor and independent           registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits.  We met with the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, both with and without management present, to discuss the results of           their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.  Prior to engaging our independent registered public accounting firm to render an audit or permissible non-audit           service, we specifically approve the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm to render that service.  Accordingly, the Company does not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to render audit or           permissible non‑audit services pursuant to pre-approval policies or procedures or otherwise, unless the engagement to provide such services has been approved by the Audit/Compliance Committee in advance.  As such, the engagement of BKD, LLP to           render 100% of the services described in the categories above was approved by the Audit/Compliance Committee in advance of the rendering of those services.  We also reviewed and discussed with BKD, LLP the fees paid to the firm.  These fees are           described under "Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" below.  The Audit/Compliance Committee received and reviewed the report of BKD, LLP regarding the results of their audit of the Company's 2018           financial statements.  We also reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with Company management.
The members of the Audit/Compliance Committee discussed with a representative of BKD, LLP           the independence of the accounting firm from the Company, including the matters required to be discussed by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees) and the written disclosures.  In addition, the           Audit/Compliance Committee receives written disclosures and a letter from BKD, LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit/Compliance           Committee concerning independence.
The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also reviewed with the           Audit/Compliance Committee the certifications that each officer filed with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002.  Management also reviewed with the Audit/Compliance Committee the policies           and procedures it has adopted to ensure the accuracy of such certifications.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, we recommended to the Board of           Directors that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
The foregoing report is furnished by the Audit/Compliance Committee:

The aggregate fees billed to the Company by BKD, LLP and its affiliates for the years           ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

  (3)  Primarily for tax compliance, tax advice and tax return preparation services.  
[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services
Pursuant to the terms of its charter, the Audit/Compliance Committee is responsible for           the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the independent auditors.  The Audit/Compliance Committee must pre-approve the engagement letters and the fees to be paid to the independent auditors for all audit and           permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors and consider the possible effect that any non-audit services could have on the independence of the auditors.  The Audit/Compliance Committee may establish pre-approval           policies and procedures, as permitted by applicable law and SEC regulations and consistent with its charter for the engagement of the independent auditors to render permissible non-audit services to the Corporation, provided that any           pre-approvals delegated to one or more members of the committee are reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting.  At this time, the Audit/Compliance Committee has not adopted any delegated pre-approval policies.
The Audit/Compliance Committee of the Board has authorized BKD, LLP to provide to the           Company tax services and certain services in connection with the administration of our benefit plans.  In authorizing those services, the Committee determined that providing those services were compatible with maintaining BKD, LLP's independence.
Selection of Audit Firm
Our Audit/Compliance Committee has appointed BKD, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to           audit the Company's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.  In making its determination to appoint BKD, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 year, the Audit/Compliance Committee           considered whether the providing of services (and the aggregate fees billed for those services) by BKD, LLP, other than audit services, is compatible with maintaining the independence of the outside accountants.  A representative of BKD, LLP is           expected to attend the meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires. We are not required to have our stockholders ratify the selection of BKD, LLP as our independent audit firm.            Because we believe it is good corporate practice to obtain the stockholders' views on this selection, we are asking the stockholders to ratify the appointment at the Annual Meeting.  The stockholder vote, however, is not binding on the           Audit/Compliance Committee because, under SEC rules, only that committee may select and appoint the Company's audit firm.  Therefore, if the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of BKD, LLP for the current year, the Audit/Compliance           Committee may appoint another firm or maintain its prior appointment of BKD, LLP.  The Audit/Compliance Committee will consider the failure of the stockholders to ratify the appointment of BKD, LLP as a direction to consider appointing a           different audit firm for the subsequent year.  Whether or not the existing appointment for 2019 is ratified, the Audit/Compliance Committee is free to appoint a different audit firm for the current year if it is determined to be in the best           interests of the Company and its stockholders.
The Company's Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of           the appointment of BKD, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board of Directors knows of no other business that will be presented at the Annual           Meeting.  If any other matter properly comes before the stockholders for a vote at the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors, as holder of your proxy, will vote your shares in accordance with its best judgment.
ADDITIONAL           INFORMATION
Proxy Solicitation Costs
 The Company will pay the costs of soliciting proxies.  The Company will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials           to the beneficial owners of the Company's common stock.  In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers, and employees of the Company may solicit proxies personally or by facsimile, telegraph or telephone, without additional           compensation.
Stockholder Proposals for 2020 annual meeting
If you intend to present a stockholder proposal at next year's annual meeting, your           proposal must be received by the Company at its executive offices, located at 110 E. Charles Street, Muncie, Indiana 47305-2400, no later than November 23, 2019, to be eligible for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement and form of proxy for           that meeting.  Your proposal will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Company's charter and bylaws and Maryland law.
To be considered for presentation at the 2020 annual meeting, but not for inclusion in the Company's Proxy           Statement and form of proxy for that meeting, stockholder proposals must be received by the Company no later than February 1, 2020 and no earlier than January 2, 2020.  If, however, the date of the next annual meeting is before April 1, 2020, or           after June 30, 2020, proposals must instead be received by the Company no earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of the next annual meeting and no later than the 90th day before the meeting or the 10th day after the day on which notice of           the date of the meeting is mailed or public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.
