COMPANY STRATEGY AND FISCAL 2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 
We are a leading global high-performance analog technology company dedicated to solving the toughest engineering challenges. We enable our customers to interpret the world around us by intelligently bridging the physical and digital with unmatched technologies that sense, measure, power, connect and interpret. Our strategy is to focus on challenges that our customers have in applications that matter the most, helping them to grow and adapt their offerings in complex and evolving markets. Our focus is largely on the business-to-business (B2B) markets of industrial, automotive and communications and their applications, as well as a few selected consumer applications, with the goal of driving sustainable and profitable growth for Analog Devices over the long-term. Our superior innovation and the 2017 acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, which we refer to as Linear Technology, broadened our technology base, which will help us deliver more value to our customers and position us for long-term profitable growth.

Increased our dividends per share paid to shareholders by 7%. 3- and 5-year TSR of 69% and 111%, respectively, outperforming the S&P 500 over the same periods. STRATEGIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS Significant progress made on the integration of Linear Technology. The combination of Analog Devices, Linear Technology, and HittiteMicrowave Corporation (acquired in 2014) has enabled us to create an unparalleled high performance analog franchise. Achieved $150 million of cost synergies announced in connection with Linear Technology acquisition. Revenue synergy opportunity has doubled to $2 billion over the past 18 months. 
Pay for Performance 
A significant portion of the total target compensation for our named executive officers, or NEOs, is variable and directly linked to Company performance in the form of variable cash incentive bonus payments and equity awards. This approach provides our executives with an opportunity to earn above peer average compensation if ADI delivers strong results. Conversely, our NEOs' total compensation is modulated if our business results are below target.

2019 Proxy Statement    3 
The pay mix charts above are based on target compensation consisting of the annual rate of base salary and short-term and long-term incentive targets approved by the Compensation Committee. The pay mix for the "other NEOs" in the chart above excludes Mr. Pietkiewicz as he remained on the legacy Linear Technology variable cash incentive bonus program for the first half of fiscal 2018. It also excludes the equity awards granted to Messrs. Cotter and Hassett in September 2018 in recognition of their meaningful contributions in fiscal 2018 in driving our top line revenue growth and profit expansion. If those equity awards were taken into account, the percentage of performance-based incentives would increase for such NEOs. For more information about the components of the performance and incentive pay mix for our NEO compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Executive Compensation." 
Please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement for a more detailed description of our executive compensation program, philosophy and design. 
Pay and Governance Practices 
Our pay and governance practices are designed to align our executives' interests with our shareholders. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓   Our cash incentive bonus awards for legacy ADI executives are based solely on our financial performance      Ò   We do not guarantee salary increases or non-performance-based bonuses 
 ✓   We have a specific policy regarding the grant dates of stock options, RSUs and other stock-based awards for our directors, executive officers and employees      Ò   We do not modify our performance targets during the performance period, even in challenging years 
 ✓   We have stock ownership guidelines for all officers and directors      Ò   We do not provide new tax gross-ups for executive officers 
 ✓   We prohibit hedging transactions and short sales involving ADI securities      Ò   With the exception of restricted stock awards assumed in connection with the Linear Technology acquisition, we do not pay dividends on unvested equity awards 
 ✓   We prohibit holding ADI securities in margin accounts      Ò   We do not provide extensive perquisites to our executives 
 ✓   We prohibit pledging ADI securities as collateral for a loan          
 ✓   Annual say on pay vote

A:  If the Analog Devices shares that you own are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or   
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement    9 
If you hold shares through an account with a broker, the voting of shares by such broker when you do not provide voting instructions is governed by applicable stock exchange rules. These rules allow brokers to vote shares at their discretion on "routine" matters for which their customers do not provide voting instructions. On matters that are considered "non-routine," brokers may not vote shares without your instruction. The ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal 3) is considered a "routine" matter and your broker will be able to vote on that proposal even if it does not receive instructions from you, so long as it holds your shares in its name. The election of directors (Proposal 1), the "say on pay" advisory vote (Proposal 2) and the shareholder proposal (Proposal 4) are "non-routine" matters. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to these proposals, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote with respect to these proposals and those votes will be counted as "broker non-votes." "Broker non-votes" are shares that are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee that indicates on its proxy that it does not have or did not exercise discretionary authority to vote on a particular proposal. 
If your shares are held in "street name," you must bring an account statement or letter from your broker or other nominee, showing that you are the beneficial owner of the shares as of the record date (January 7, 2019) in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting on March 13, 2019. To be able to vote your shares held in "street name" at the Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee, issued in your name giving you the right to vote your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote after I have mailed my proxy card or after I have voted my shares over the  Internet or by telephone?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. If you are the "record holder" of your shares, you can revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time  before the polls close at the Annual Meeting by doing any one of the following things:  
[END TABLE]
Your attendance at the meeting alone will not revoke your proxy. 
If your shares are held in "street name," you may submit a new, later-dated voting instruction form or contact your bank, broker or other nominee. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described in the answer to the question above entitled "Can I vote if my shares are held in 'street name'"? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote my shares held in trust in the Analog Ireland Success Sharing Share Plan?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you participate in the Analog Ireland Success Sharing Share Plan, which we refer to as the Ireland share plan, you may  instruct Irish Pensions Trust Limited, which serves as the trustee of the Ireland share plan, to vote the amount of shares of common stock that they hold on your behalf as of the record date. You will receive a voting card that you may use to direct  Mercer Ireland Limited, or Mercer, which administers the Irish share plan on behalf of Irish Pensions Trust Limited, how to vote your shares. You should sign the voting card and return it to Mercer in the envelope provided. Mercer will vote the  shares in the manner that you direct on the voting card. If Mercer does not receive your voting card by 5:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on March 6, 2019, Mercer will not vote your shares.

Q:  What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In order for business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting, a quorum must be present in person or represented by valid  proxies. For each of the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting, a quorum consists of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on January 7, 2019, the record date, or at least 184,649,911 shares.   
[END TABLE]
Shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy (including "broker non-votes" and shares that abstain or do not vote with respect to a particular proposal) will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting for that proposal. 
If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required for each proposal?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Election of directors. Under our bylaws, a nominee will be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast  "for" the nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" the nominee's election, with abstentions and "broker non-votes" not counting as votes "for" or  "against." If the shares you own are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee, your bank, broker or other nominee, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your  instructions. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to this proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the election of directors. If an incumbent director  nominee in an uncontested election of directors receives a majority of votes "against" his or her election, the director must tender a resignation from the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will then decide whether to accept the  resignation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote (based on the recommendation of a committee of independent directors). We will publicly disclose the Board of Directors' decision and its reasoning with regard to the  offered resignation.  
[END TABLE]
"Say on Pay." Our Board of Directors is seeking a non-binding advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in the Compensation 
 Discussion and Analysis, executive compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosures contained in this proxy statement. Under our bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of votes cast on the proposal is needed to approve this resolution. The vote is advisory and non-binding in nature but our Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to this proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to this proposal. 
Ratification of independent registered public accounting firm. Under our bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of votes cast on the proposal is needed to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Even if you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to this proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee may vote your shares with respect to this proposal. 
Shareholder Proposal. Under our bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of votes cast on the proposal is needed to approve the shareholder proposal. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to this proposal, your bank, broker or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to this proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How will votes be counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Each share of common stock will be counted as one vote according to the instructions contained on a properly completed  proxy card, whether submitted in person, by mail, over the Internet or by telephone, or on a ballot voted in person at the Annual Meeting. With respect to all proposals, shares will not be voted in favor of the matter, and will not be counted as  voting on the matter, if they either (1) abstain from voting on a particular matter, or (2) are "broker non-votes." Banks, brokers and other nominees who do not receive instructions with  respect to Proposals 1, 2 or 4 will not be allowed to vote these shares, and all such shares will be "broker non-votes" rather than votes "for" or "against." Accordingly, assuming

Our bylaws establish the process for a shareholder to bring a matter before a meeting. See "How and when may I submit a shareholder proposal, including a shareholder nomination for director, for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders?" below.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Shareholder director nominations for inclusion in proxy statement: The Board of Directors has implemented a proxy access  provision in our amended and restated Bylaws, or Bylaws, which allows a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders owning in aggregate 3% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and  include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the number of directors in office or two nominees, whichever is greater, provided the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the bylaws. If a shareholder  or group of shareholders wishes to nominate one or more director candidates to be included in our proxy statement pursuant to these proxy access provisions in Article I, Section 1.9(c) of our bylaws, the Secretary must receive advance written notice  at the address noted below not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of our annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than  60 days, from the anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, then we must receive such notice at the address noted below not earlier than the 150th day before such annual meeting and not later than the close of  business on the later of (1) the

Shareholder director nominations not included in proxy statement: In addition, our bylaws require that we be given advance written notice for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and other matters that shareholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting other than those to be included in our proxy statement under Rule 14a-8. The Secretary must receive such notice at the address noted below not less than 90 days or more than 120 days before the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of our annual meeting is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the anniversary date, then we must receive such notice at the address noted below not earlier than the 120th day before such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (1) the 90th day before such annual meeting and (2) the seventh day after the day on which notice of the meeting date was mailed or public disclosure was made, whichever occurs first. Assuming that the 2020 annual meeting is not advanced by more than 20 days nor delayed by more than 60 days from the anniversary date of the 2019 annual meeting, you would need to give us appropriate notice at the address noted below no earlier than November 14, 2019, and no later than December 14, 2019. If a shareholder does not provide timely notice of a nomination or other matter to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting, under Massachusetts law, it may not be brought before our shareholders at a meeting. 
Our bylaws also specify requirements relating to the content of the notice that shareholders must provide to the Secretary of Analog Devices for any matter, including a shareholder proposal or nomination for director, to be properly presented at a shareholder meeting.

In addition to solicitations by mail, Alliance Advisors and our directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies by telephone, email  and personal interviews without additional remuneration. We will request brokers, custodians and fiduciaries to forward proxy soliciting material to the owners of shares of our common stock that they hold in their names.

HOUSEHOLDING OF ANNUAL MEETING MATERIALS 
Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports.

(3)  The number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each person is determined under applicable SEC rules. Under  these rules, a person is deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of any shares over which that person has or shares voting or investment power, plus any shares that the person has the right to acquire within 60 days, including through  the exercise of stock options. Unless otherwise indicated, for each person named in the table, the number in the "Shares Acquirable within 60 Days" column consists of shares covered by stock options that may be exercised and  restricted stock units, or RSUs, that vest within 60 days after January 4, 2019.  
(4)  The percent ownership for each shareholder on January 4, 2019 is calculated by dividing (1) the total number of  shares beneficially owned by the shareholder by (2) the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on January 4, 2019 (369,413,139 shares) plus any shares acquirable (including exercisable stock options) by the shareholder in  question within 60 days after January 4, 2019.

(6)  Based solely on a Form 13F-HR filed by BlackRock Inc. on November 9, 2018 reporting stock ownership as of  September 30, 2018. BlackRock Inc. also reported that, as of September 30, 2018, it had sole voting power for 21,278,134 shares and no voting power with respect to 2,994,096 shares.  
(7)  Based solely on a Form 13F-HR/A filed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. on November 13, 2018 reporting stock ownership as of  September 30, 2018. JPMorgan Chase & Co. also reported that, as of September 30, 2018, it had sole voting power for 19,464,950 shares, other investment power for 292,319 shares, shared voting power for 211,333 shares, shared investment  power for 21,636,911 shares and no voting power with respect to 2,252,947 shares.

Includes 733,709 shares held by Mr. Stata's spouse and 133,138 shares held directly by Mr. Stata that are pledged as collateral for a line of credit from a bank, which is unchanged compared to last year. Due to a typographical error,  our 2018 proxy statement incorrectly stated the number of shares pledged by Mr. Stata as of January 12, 2018 as 123,138 instead of 133,138. Since January 2013, we have prohibited our directors and executive officers from future pledging of  their Company securities as collateral for a loan.

ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS 
Since our inception as a public company, we have maintained an active engagement program with our shareholders, meeting with them extensively throughout the year as part of our investor outreach efforts. In fiscal 2018, we held more than 330 meetings with our shareholders, including the majority of our top 25 shareholders, to discuss the Company's performance and prospects, as well as trends affecting the semiconductor industry. We also continued our specific outreach effort with our institutional investors to discuss corporate governance issues affecting the Company. During 2018, we reached out to our top 25 shareholders, representing approximately 63% of outstanding shares with an invitation to have discussions with their corporate governance teams. Of the shareholders who accepted our engagement invitation, topics covered in these meetings included:

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
We have a long history of leadership in corporate responsibility, and pursue corporate social responsibility and sustainability along four axes—economic, environmental, social, and governance and ethics. 
2019 Proxy Statement    25 
Economic Sustainability. ADI works to ensure that our technological innovations continue to have impact and our employees, customers, partners and investors continue to share in the success of ADI. This is executed through our best-in-class financial model, global operations, and smart supply chain management. Economic sustainability considers the economic conditions of all of our stakeholders: employees, their families and communities, the communities where we operate, and world we all live in. 
Environmental Sustainability. At ADI, we are committed to operating in a way that minimizes impacts to the environment. We establish environmental performance objectives using a five-year planning horizon, and make annual updates to our objectives, targets, and programs. Progress is reviewed quarterly at the corporate level and monthly at the site level, and senior management allocates resources appropriately to help keep programs on plan. 
Social Sustainability. ADI's stakeholder ecosystem extends beyond the typical focus on investors, employees, and customers to the communities and world in which we operate. We strive to be a positive influence in our communities by living up to the highest ethical standards, pursuing socially minded business practices, providing rewarding career and employment opportunities, and giving back to our communities in concert with our employees' individual efforts. 
Governance and Ethical Sustainability. Ethical behavior has been a core tenet of our Company's values since our earliest days. Our employees, across all locations and job functions, have internalized the value of ethical behavior, routinely going beyond mere compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our long history of leadership in the area of governance and ethics has resulted in a trusted reputation among our customers, investors, and employees, as well as the communities where we operate. That is a trust that we have worked hard to earn and one we don't take lightly.

DETERMINATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
Under applicable Nasdaq Rules, a director of Analog Devices will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, that person does not have a relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors has established guidelines (within our Corporate Governance Guidelines) to assist it in determining whether a director has a relationship with Analog Devices that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. These guidelines are posted on our website under investor.analog.com/corporate-governance.cfm. For relationships not covered by the guidelines, the determination of whether such a relationship exists is made by the members of our Board of Directors who are independent (as defined above). Our Board of Directors has determined that none of Messrs. Champy, Evans, Novich and Sicchitano, Ms. Golz and Drs. Chandrakasan, Frank, Little and Su has a relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is an "independent director" as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Roche, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Stata, our Chairman and founder, are not "independent" under the Nasdaq Rules because Mr. Roche is a current employee and Mr. Stata is our founder. The Board of Directors considered the Company's annual laboratory membership and sponsorship of university research projects with MIT (of which Anantha P. Chandrakasan is the Dean of the School of Engineering and James A. Champy is a board member) and Karen Golz's former affiliation with Ernst & Young and determined that those relationships would not interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.

DIRECTOR CANDIDATES 
Shareholders of record of Analog Devices may recommend director candidates for inclusion by the Board of Directors in the slate of nominees that the Board of Directors recommends to our shareholders for election. The qualifications of recommended candidates will be reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. If the Board of Directors determines to nominate a shareholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election as a director by the shareholders, the name will be included in Analog Devices' proxy card for the shareholders' meeting at which his or her election is recommended. 
Shareholders may recommend individuals for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider as potential director candidates by submitting their names and background and a statement as to whether the shareholder or group of shareholders making the recommendation has beneficially owned more than 5% of Analog Devices' common stock for at least one year as of the date the recommendation is made, to the "Analog Devices Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee," c/o Margaret K. Seif, Secretary, Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider a recommendation only if appropriate biographical information and background material is provided on a timely basis. 
The process followed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to identify and evaluate candidates includes requests to Board members and others for recommendations, meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates and interviews of selected candidates by members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors. From time to time, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also seek input from director search firms for identification and evaluation of candidates. Assuming that appropriate biographical and background material is provided for candidates recommended by shareholders on a timely basis, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate director candidates recommended by shareholders by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for director candidates submitted by Board members. 
Shareholders also have the right to directly nominate director candidates, without any action or recommendation on the part of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Directors, by following the procedures set forth in ADI's amended and restated bylaws and described in the response to the question "How and when may I submit a shareholder proposal, including a shareholder nomination for director, for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders?" above. 
In considering whether to recommend any candidate for inclusion in the Board of Directors' slate of recommended director nominees, including candidates recommended by shareholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will apply the criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include the candidate's integrity, business acumen, experience, commitment, and diligence, the presence of any conflicts of interest and the ability of the candidate to act in the interests of all shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks nominees with a broad diversity of experience, professions, skills, geographic representation and backgrounds. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. Analog Devices believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Board of Directors to fulfill its responsibilities. While we do not have a policy regarding Board diversity, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee includes gender, racial and ethnic diversity as part of its search criteria, consistent with the requirement for relevant and diverse experience, skills and industry familiarity. 
COMMUNICATIONS FROM SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES 
The Board of Directors will give appropriate attention to written communications on issues that are submitted by shareholders and other interested parties, and will respond if and as appropriate. Absent unusual circumstances or as contemplated by committee charters, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will, with the assistance of Analog Devices' internal legal counsel, (1) be primarily responsible for monitoring communications from shareholders and other interested parties and (2) provide copies or summaries of such communications to the other directors as he considers appropriate. 
2019 Proxy Statement    27 
Communications will be forwarded to all directors if they relate to substantive matters and include suggestions or comments that the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers to be important for the directors to review. In general, communications relating to corporate governance and long-term corporate strategy are more likely to be forwarded than communications relating to personal grievances, commercial solicitations, and matters as to which Analog Devices tends to receive repetitive or duplicative communications. 
Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to send communications on any topic to the Board of Directors (including the Presiding Director or the independent directors as a group) should address such communications to James A. Champy, Presiding Director, c/o Secretary, Analog Devices, Inc., One Technology Way, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be separate, unless otherwise determined by a majority of the Board of Directors, and we currently separate these roles. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day-to-day leadership and performance of the Company, while our Chairman of the Board of Directors provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer, sets the agenda for Board meetings and presides over meetings of the full Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Stata, our Chairman and founder, is not an independent director under the Nasdaq Rules, our Board of Directors has appointed James A. Champy as Presiding Director to preside at all executive sessions of directors without management present. The Board of Directors meets in executive session at each regular meeting. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES 
The Board of Directors has responsibility for reviewing our overall performance, rather than day-to-day operations. The Board of Directors' primary responsibility is to oversee the management of the Company and, in so doing, serve the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board of Directors provides for the succession of the Chief Executive Officer, nominates for election at annual shareholder meetings individuals to serve as directors of Analog Devices, and elects individuals to fill any vacancies on the Board of Directors. It reviews corporate objectives and strategies, and evaluates and approves significant policies and proposed major commitments of corporate resources. It participates in decisions that have a potential major economic impact on Analog Devices. Management keeps the directors informed of Company activity through regular written reports and presentations at Board and committee meetings. 
The Board of Directors met 12 times in fiscal 2018 (including by telephone conference). During fiscal 2018, each of our directors attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which he or she served. The Board of Directors has standing Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. All members of all three committees are independent, non-employee directors. Each committee has a charter that has been approved by the Board of Directors and is reviewed annually. In addition, each Committee conducts an annual self-evaluation of its own performance. Mr. Roche is the only current director who is, or has been in the past three years, an employee of Analog Devices. Messrs. Roche and Stata do not serve on any standing Board committee and do not participate in the portion of any Board or committee meeting during which their compensation is evaluated. The independent directors met in executive session without Messrs. Stata or Roche at each in-person Board meeting in fiscal 2018. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our policy that directors are expected to attend annual meetings of shareholders. All of our then-serving directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Audit Committee 
The current members of our Audit Committee are Messrs. Sicchitano (Chair) and Evans, Ms. Golz and Dr. Little. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Sicchitano and Evans, Ms. Golz and Dr. Little qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules of the SEC and is independent as defined under the Nasdaq Rules and the independence requirements under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the 
28    Analog Devices, Inc. 
Exchange Act. In addition, our Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is able to read and understand financial statements, including the Company's consolidated balance sheet and its consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows and related notes as required under the Nasdaq Rules. The Board of Directors has certified that it has at least one member of the audit committee who has past employment experience in finance or accounting as required by the Nasdaq Rules. None of Messrs. Sicchitano and Evans, Ms. Golz or Dr. Little serves on the audit committees of more than two other public companies. 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors' oversight of (i) the integrity of our financial statements and the Company's systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, (ii) the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, and (iii) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage any independent legal, accounting and other advisors that it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. These independent advisors may be the regular advisors to the Company. The Audit Committee is empowered, without further action by the Board of Directors, to cause the Company to pay the compensation of those advisors as established by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee selected and appointed Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and did not retain any other advisors during fiscal 2018. The Audit Committee met 9 times during fiscal 2018 (including by telephone conference). The responsibilities of our Audit Committee and its activities during fiscal 2018 are described in the Report of the Audit Committee below. 
Compensation Committee 
The current members of our Compensation Committee are Mr. Novich (Chair) and Drs. Frank and Su. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Novich and Drs. Frank and Su is independent as defined under the Nasdaq Rules and the independence requirements under Rule 10C-1 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee evaluates and sets the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers, and makes recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding the compensation of our directors. The Compensation Committee oversees the evaluation of senior management. In connection with its oversight and administration of ADI's cash and equity incentive plans, the Compensation Committee authorizes the granting of stock options, RSUs and other stock incentives (within guidelines established by our Board of Directors and in accordance with our Stock Option and Stock-Based Award Grant Date Policies) to our officers. In accordance with the terms of our Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2005 Plan, and the Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2010 Plan (the latter two of which were assumed by us in the Linear Technology acquisition), the Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the power to grant and modify options, RSUs and other stock awards to employees who are not executive officers or directors, subject to specified thresholds, parameters and applicable law. Our Compensation Committee held 12 meetings (including by telephone conference) during fiscal 2018. 
Compensation Committee Consultants. The Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to retain or obtain the advice of any independent legal, accounting or other advisors it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee is empowered, without further action by the Board of Directors, to cause the Company to pay the compensation of these advisors as established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer and Partners, or Pearl Meyer, an independent compensation consultant, during fiscal 2018. Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee and assists the Compensation Committee in evaluating and designing our executive and director compensation program and policies. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee instructed Pearl Meyer to assist in the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• defining a peer group of companies;

[END TABLE]
In connection with its work for the Compensation Committee, Pearl Meyer is invited to attend the Compensation Committee's meetings and, upon request of the Compensation Committee, attends executive sessions of the Compensation Committee. Pearl Meyer is retained only by the Compensation Committee and does not provide any other consulting services to Analog Devices. The Compensation Committee also solicits advice from time to time from our outside counsel, WilmerHale. The Compensation Committee assesses the independence of its advisors on an annual basis. The Compensation Committee requested and received an independence letter from each of Pearl Meyer and WilmerHale providing information to assist the Compensation Committee in selecting and receiving advice from such advisor after considering the independence factors that are identified in the Nasdaq rules. The Compensation Committee determined that the engagement of these advisors did not raise any conflicts of interest for all work performed for the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018. The activities of our Compensation Committee and the services Pearl Meyer performed for the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018 are further described in "INFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The current members of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Mr. Champy (Chair) and Dr. Frank. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Champy and Dr. Frank is independent as defined under the Nasdaq Rules. The primary responsibility of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to identify individuals qualified to become Board members consistent with criteria approved by the Board of Directors, recommend to the Board of Directors the persons to be nominated by the Board of Directors for election as directors at any meeting of shareholders and the persons to be elected by the Board to fill any vacancies on the Board, recommend to the Board of Directors the directors to be appointed to each committee of the Board of Directors, develop and recommend to the Board of Directors a set of corporate governance principles and oversee the evaluation of the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also leads the Board of Directors' succession planning efforts with respect to senior executives and oversight of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to engage any independent legal and other advisors it deems necessary or appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. These independent advisors may be the regular advisors to the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is empowered, without further action by the Board of Directors, to cause the Company to pay the compensation of these advisors as established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. For information relating to nominations of directors by our shareholders, see "— Director Candidates" above. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2018 (including by telephone conference).

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assisted the Board of Directors' oversight of (i) the integrity of our financial statements and the Company's systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, (ii) the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, and (iii) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also met privately with our independent registered public accounting firm and our Director of Internal Audit to discuss our financial statements and disclosures, accounting policies and their application, internal controls over financial reporting, and other matters of importance to the Audit Committee, the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and the quarterly financial statements during fiscal 2018, including the specific disclosures in the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." These discussions also addressed the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee reported on these meetings to our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee also selected and appointed our independent registered public accounting firm, reviewed the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm during the annual audit and on assignments unrelated to the audit, assessed the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewed and approved the independent registered public accounting firm's fees. The Audit Committee also has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services for the purpose of maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors. 
2019 Proxy Statement    31 
The Audit Committee reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm (i) the matters to be discussed as required by AS 1301: Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and (ii) the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from Analog Devices and its management, including the matters in the written disclosures and the letter we received from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee on independence. The Audit Committee considered the appropriateness of the provision of non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm relative to their independence. 
Based on its review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors approved) that our audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018. The Audit Committee also selected Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019.

Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures 
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services for the purpose of maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. We may not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to render any audit or non-audit service unless either the service is approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement to render the service is entered into pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee may pre-approve services that are expected to be provided to Analog Devices by the independent registered public accounting firm during the following 12 months. At the time the pre-approval is granted, the Audit Committee must (1) identify the particular pre-approved services in a sufficient level of detail so that management will not be called upon to make a judgment as to whether a proposed service fits within the pre-approved services and (2) establish a monetary limit with respect to each particular pre-approved service, which limit may not be exceeded without obtaining further pre-approval under the policy. At regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee, management or the independent registered public accounting firm must report to the Audit Committee regarding each service actually provided to Analog Devices. 
If the cost of any service exceeds the pre-approved monetary limit, that service must be approved (1) by the entire Audit Committee if the cost of the service exceeds $100,000 or (2) by the Chairman of the Audit Committee if the cost of the service is less than $100,000 but greater than $10,000. If the cost of any service exceeds the pre-approved monetary limit, individual items with a cost of less than $10,000 each do not require further pre-approval, provided that the total cost of all individual items does not exceed $40,000 and an update of all items in this category is provided to the Audit Committee at each quarterly scheduled meeting. However, if the cost of all the individual items will exceed $40,000, the Chairman of the Audit Committee must receive a summary of those items with a request for approval of any amounts to be incurred in excess of $40,000. 
The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee to pre-approve any audit or non-audit services to be provided to Analog Devices by the independent registered public accounting firm for which the cost is less than $100,000. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, all services provided to Analog Devices by Ernst & Young LLP were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policies and procedures described above. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Our non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable directors and to provide equity-based compensation to align the interests of our directors with those of our shareholders. Each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer and an annual equity award in the form of RSUs. To reflect their additional responsibilities, the Chairs and members of all committees receive an additional cash retainer. The Presiding Director also receives an additional cash retainer. Mr. Roche, as an employee director, does not receive any additional compensation for his services as director. 
The Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation Committee the responsibility to review and recommend to the Board of Directors any proposed changes to non-employee director compensation. Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews with Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, non-employee director compensation information for our peer group to check the alignment of our non-employee director compensation package with market practice and current trends. The Compensation Committee then makes recommendations to the full Board with respect to compensation of our non-employee directors, and the full Board reviews these recommendations and makes a final determination. 
In fiscal 2018 we granted 100% of the value of the annual equity award to each of our non-employee directors in the form of time-based RSUs. These RSUs vest in full on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the date of the Company's next annual meeting. On March 14, 2018, we granted each non-employee director 2,155 RSUs for services to be provided during fiscal 2018. On July 16, 2018, Ms. Golz, who joined the Board in June 2018, was granted 1,504 RSUs for services to be provided during fiscal 2018.

Stock Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors 
Under our stock ownership guidelines, the target share ownership level for non-employee directors is at least four times the directors' annual cash retainer. Directors have four years to achieve their targeted level. Shares subject to unexercised options, whether or not vested, and any shares that have been pledged as collateral for a loan will not be counted for purposes of satisfying these guidelines. Unvested RSUs are counted for purposes of satisfying the guidelines. All of our non-employee directors were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines as of the end of fiscal 2018. 
Equity Award Policy for Non-Employee Directors 
During fiscal 2018, our equity award grant policy for non-employee directors provided for the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each newly elected non-employee director elected other than at an annual meeting of  shareholders is automatically granted under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan an RSU award for a number of shares of our common stock approved by the Board of Directors, on the 15th day of the month following the month of the date of initial election as  a director, or if Nasdaq is closed on that day, the next succeeding business day that Nasdaq is open.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On an annual basis, each non-employee director elected or re-elected at an annual meeting of shareholders is automatically granted under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan an RSU award for a number of shares of our common stock approved by the Board of Directors, on the  date of our annual meeting of shareholders, or if Nasdaq is closed on that day, the next succeeding business day that Nasdaq is open.  
[END TABLE]
For fiscal 2018, RSUs granted to our non-employee directors under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan vest on the earlier of the date of the Annual Meeting and the first anniversary of the date of grant, subject to acceleration as described below. The RSU awards vest in full upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event (as defined in the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan) or the director's death. If the director ceases to serve as a director by reason of his or her disability, as determined by the Board of Directors, each outstanding and 
2019 Proxy Statement    35 
unvested RSU will vest in full at the time he or she ceases to be a director. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control Event or in the event of the director's death, disability or retirement after age 60, each vested option will continue to be exercisable for the balance of its term. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Transactions with Related Persons 
During fiscal 2018, Mr. Stata, our founder and Chairman of the Board, received a cash retainer for service on the Board of $250,000. Following his retirement as an employee in 2012, the Company agreed to provide medical and dental benefits to Mr. Stata and his spouse during their lifetimes on the same basis as provided to U.S. employees of the Company. The value of those medical and dental benefits in 2018 was $13,884. On March 14, 2018, we granted 2,155 RSUs to Mr. Stata. This award is identical to the award granted to our other non-employee directors on March 14, 2018 and vests on the earlier of the date of the Annual Meeting or the first anniversary of the grant date. 
The Company contributes annually to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to fund university research projects. In fiscal 2018, the Company made approximately $2.4 million in total contributions to MIT of which $120,000 funded a graduate student working in Dr. Chandrakasan's laboratory. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
Our Board of Directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which Analog Devices is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5% shareholders (or their immediate family members, each of whom we refer to as a "related person" has a direct or indirect material interest. 
If a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a "related person transaction," the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our General Counsel. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Whenever practicable, the reporting, review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If our General Counsel determines that advance review and approval is not practicable, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction at the next meeting of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The policy also permits the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions that arise between committee meetings, subject to ratification by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at its next meeting. Any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually. 
A related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee after full disclosure of the related person's interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and consider: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the related person's interest in the related person transaction;

• any other information regarding the related person transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed  transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction.  
[END TABLE]
36    Analog Devices, Inc. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in Analog Devices' best interests. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may, in its sole discretion, impose any conditions on us or the related person in connection with approval of the related person transaction. 
In addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC's related person transaction disclosure rule, the Board of Directors has determined that the following transactions do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related persons and, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• interests arising solely from the related person's position as an executive officer of another entity (whether or not  the person is also a director of that entity), that is a participant in a transaction, where (a) the related person and all other related persons own in the aggregate less than a 10% equity interest in the entity, (b) the related person  and his or her immediate family members are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction, and (c) the amount involved in the transaction equals less than  the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the annual gross revenues of the company receiving payment under the transaction; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the transactions that are specifically contemplated by provisions of Analog Devices' charter or bylaws.

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
We are requesting shareholder approval of the compensation of the executive officers named in our Summary Compensation Table below, who we refer to as our "named executive officers" or "NEOs." We are required to provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. At the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders voted in favor of holding future "say on pay" votes every year. In accordance with the results of that vote, our Board of Directors determined to submit "say on pay" proposals to our shareholders every year. 
Our Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve the following non-binding advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosures in this proxy statement, is hereby approved. 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, this is an advisory vote, which means that this proposal is not binding on us. Our Compensation Committee, however, values the opinions expressed by our shareholders and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. You may vote for, against or abstain from voting on this matter. 
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, our compensation program for our NEOs received the support of 96.8% of the total votes cast. 
As described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, ADI's executive compensation program is significantly performance-based and designed to attract, retain and motivate strong executives to lead our complex, global organization and to align their interests with those of our shareholders. We seek to provide total compensation to our executives that is competitive with our peers, and we believe that our executive compensation program is designed to encourage the most talented individuals to grow their careers at ADI. 
ADI has a longstanding philosophy and practice of paying executives for performance. In order to align our pay practices with shareholder interests, we tie a significant percentage of each executive's compensation to the Company's performance, in the form of variable cash incentive bonus payments and equity awards that rise in value only if our stock price increases. In fiscal 2018, a year in which ADI exceeded both our profitability and year-over-year revenue growth targets, aggregate payments under our executive performance incentive bonus plan were made at 183% of target, compared to 248% in fiscal 2017 and 85% in the fiscal year ended October 29, 2016, or fiscal 2016. 
We believe that our executive compensation program is working as intended and appropriately aligns executive pay with Company performance. 
 Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.

INFORMATION ABOUT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
We intend to provide compensation for our executives that is competitive with our peers, with an opportunity for increased compensation if the Company's performance warrants. We have designed our compensation program to make a substantial percentage of our executive pay variable, subject to increase when corporate targets are overachieved and reduction when corporate targets are not reached. The elements of our executives' total compensation are base salary, variable cash incentive awards, long-term equity compensation awards, and retirement and other employee benefits. 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or CD&A, and the tables and narrative that follow provide important information about our executive officer compensation program for fiscal 2018. In this proxy statement, the terms "named executive officers" or "NEOs" refer to the following individuals who served as executive officers during fiscal 2018:

Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top executive talent and align the interests of our executives and our shareholders. We accomplish this through the following steps: 
COMPENSATION PROCESSES AND PHILOSOPHY Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain top executive talent and align the interests of our executives and our shareholders. We accomplish this through the following steps: First, we ensure our executive compensation is competitive and attracts and retains top executive talent by understanding how the total target compensation (consisting of salary, bonus, and equity awards) of our NEOs compares to the total target compensation of those in similar positions within our peer group. We then consider a variety of factors, including the scope of the role, tenure in the position, and the performance and experience of the individual when deciding how to position each NEOs total target compensation to the total target compensation of those in similar positions within our peer group. We structure our compensation package to align executives interests with those of our shareholders by tying a significant portion of their total compensation directly to ADIs short- and long-term performance, which for the NEOs is measured by OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth, which both drive shareholder value, stock price appreciation, and relative total shareholder return. 
Our Chief Executive Officer's compensation is described in more detail below under "—Chief Executive Officer Compensation." Our other NEOs' compensation is described in more detail below under "—Compensation for Other Named Executive Officers."

Pay and Governance Practices 
Our pay and governance practices are designed to align our executives' interests with our shareholders. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓   Our cash incentive bonus awards for legacy ADI executives are based solely on our financial performance      Ò   We do not guarantee salary increases or non-performance-based bonuses 
 ✓   We have a specific policy regarding the grant dates of stock options, RSUs and other stock-based awards for our directors, executive officers and employees      Ò    We do not modify our performance targets during the performance period, even in challenging years   
 ✓   We have a specific policy regarding the grant dates of stock options, RSUs and other stock-based awards for our directors, executive officers and employees      Ò    We do not modify our performance targets during the performance period, even in challenging years   
 ✓   We prohibit hedging transactions and short sales involving ADI securities      Ò   With the exception of restricted stock awards assumed in connection with the Linear Technology acquisition, we do not pay dividends on unvested equity awards 
 ✓   We prohibit holding ADI securities in margin accounts      Ò   We do not provide extensive perquisites to our executives 
 ✓   We prohibit pledging ADI securities as collateral for a loan          
 ✓   Annual say on pay vote             
[END TABLE]
Pay for Performance 
A significant portion of the total target compensation for our executives is in the form of variable, performance-based incentive compensation, with only a small portion of the total target compensation provided in the form of "fixed" compensation. We believe this provides our executives an opportunity to earn above peer average compensation if ADI delivers strong results, and conversely, if the Company delivers weaker results, our executives would earn less compensation. The target pay mix for our NEOs (other than Mr. Pietkiewicz) for fiscal 2018 is shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
**  Does not equal 100% due to rounding.

The pay mix charts above are based on target compensation consisting of the annual rate of base salary and short-term and long-term incentive targets approved by the Compensation Committee. The pay 
40    Analog Devices, Inc. 
mix for the "other NEOs" in the chart above excludes Mr. Pietkiewicz as he remained on the legacy Linear Technology variable cash incentive bonus program for the first half of fiscal 2018. It also excludes the equity awards granted to Messrs. Cotter and Hassett in September 2018 in recognition of their meaningful contributions in fiscal 2018 in driving our top line revenue growth and profit expansion. If those equity awards were taken into account, the percentage of performance-based incentives would increase for such NEOs. For more information about the components of the performance and incentive pay mix for our Named Executive Officer Compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Executive Compensation." 
Variable Cash Incentive Bonus Payments. For fiscal 2018, we linked a significant portion of our executives' cash compensation to ADI's performance, measured by our OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth on a quarterly basis, through our executive performance incentive plan. The performance metrics and targets for our executive performance incentive plan for the first half of fiscal 2018 excluded the results of Linear Technology as the legacy Linear Technology employees remained on their legacy profit sharing incentive program for that time period. For the second half of fiscal 2018, we aligned the compensation of our executives and legacy ADI and Linear Technology employees, so the performance metrics and targets for the second half of fiscal 2018 included the results of Linear Technology and were identical for eligible employees and executives alike, to drive consistent business goals. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee set target percentages of 150% of base salary for our Chief Executive Officer and between 90%-100% of base salary for our remaining NEOs. The Compensation Committee selected these target bonus percentages to ensure that a substantial portion of each executive's cash compensation is directly linked to our business performance. For a description of Mr. Pietkiewicz's variable cash incentive bonus payment for the first half of fiscal 2018, see "Compensation for Other Named Executive Officers—Compensation for Steve Pietkiewicz, Senior Vice President, Power Products" below. 
In setting performance targets for our executive performance incentive plan, multiple factors are considered including our actual past business results, estimates of multi-year performance from our long-term strategic planning, and the performance of market competitors. Based on our evaluation of these factors, we develop a range of performance scenarios and then set goals at threshold, target and maximum performance levels. Based on analyses of our peer group performance over the past three years, as presented by our Compensation Committee's independent consultant, Pearl Meyer, our OPBT margin targets (30% for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and 39% for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018) were well above our peer group median performance, while our annual growth rate targets (8% for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and 5% for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018) were well aligned with our peer group median performance. We increased the OPBT margin targets and decreased the annual growth rate targets for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 to align both with the financial profile of the combined company following the acquisition of Linear Technology and our Company's post-acquisition long-term financial model, which we announced at our Investor Day in June 2017. 
Equity Awards. We also link pay and performance by providing a significant amount of our executives' compensation in the form of equity awards, the value of which is directly tied to our stock price performance over the long term. In fiscal 2018, approximately 62% of the average total target compensation of our NEOs (excluding Mr. Pietkiewicz) was in the form of equity. In fiscal 2018, the form and mix of equity awards delivered as part of our annual equity award program for our NEOs was as follows: 
Performance-Based RSUs. Approximately 33% of the value was delivered in the form of performance-based RSUs, under which the number of shares of ADI common stock received following vesting will be based on ADI's total shareholder return, or TSR, performance (defined as share price appreciation plus cumulative cash dividend payments) measured against the median TSR of a defined comparator group of companies over a three-year period. These performance-based RSUs for our executives ensure a direct link between the value of our long-term incentives and the value that is created for our shareholders. 
Time-Based RSUs. Approximately 33% of the value was delivered in the form of time-based RSUs, which increase or decrease in value depending on our share performance. 
2019 Proxy Statement    41 
Stock Options. Approximately 33% of the value of our executives' equity was delivered in the form of stock options that provide a direct link between these awards and the appreciation of the stock owned by our shareholders. 
Benchmarking 
In making its compensation determinations, including base salary, cash incentive bonus award targets and long-term equity compensation, the Compensation Committee annually reviews the total compensation that each of our executives is eligible to receive against the compensation levels of comparable positions of a peer group of companies. The composition of the peer group is also reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. In fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer to conduct a review of the composition of the Company's peer group for fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee has sought to select peer companies that are publicly traded, headquartered in the United States, compete with us for talent, and are similar to ADI in their product and services offerings, business model, revenue size and market capitalization. As a result of rapid consolidation in the semiconductor industry over the last several years, in addition to companies that meet the criteria outlined above, the peer group for 2018 included companies outside of the semiconductor industry. These additional companies are similar in size and have similar gross margins and research and development spend as the Company, include peers of peers and peers of other companies in our sector, and we often compete with them for talent. 
The peer group used by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2018 to evaluate executive compensation was the same as the peer group used in fiscal 2017 and consisted of the following companies:

Base Salary Provide stable source of income Attract and retain executive talent Retirement and Other Employee Benefits Retain executive talent by providing financial protection and security Cash Incentive Bonus Award Link pay and short-term Company performance Motivate and reward executive officers for achieving short-term Company financial objectives aligned with value creation Long-Term Equity Compensation Performance-based RSUs, Stock Options and Time-based RSUs Link pay and long-term Company performance Align the interests of executive officers with shareholders by rewarding long-term stock price appreciation Promote long-term retention and permit executive officers to accumulate equity ownership in the Company Fixed Pay Variable At-Risk Pay 
In connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology, we made commitments covering the compensation and benefits of legacy Linear Technology employees, including Mr. Pietkiewicz, through May 5, 2018, the end of the second quarter of our fiscal 2018. For a summary of Mr. Pietkiewicz' compensation for the first half of fiscal 2018, please refer to "Compensation for Other Named Executive Officers—Compensation for Steve Pietkiewicz, Senior Vice President, Power Products" below and in the tabular disclosures. 
Base Salary 
We use salaries for similar positions within our peer group as an important factor in setting a base salary that can attract and retain talent. When setting the fiscal 2018 base salary for each individual NEO, the Compensation Committee also considered other factors, including the scope of the role and the performance and experience of the individual. 
Fiscal 2018 Executive Performance Incentive Plan 
In November 2017 and January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the terms of our executive performance incentive plan for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. The plans are designed to be variable, depending on ADI's operating results. 
2019 Proxy Statement    43 
All executive officers, including our NEOs (other than Mr. Pietkiewicz), participated in our first half of fiscal 2018 executive performance incentive plan. All executive officers, including our NEOs, participated in our second half of fiscal 2018 executive performance incentive plan. We calculated and paid bonuses under the fiscal 2018 plans as follows: 
Base Salary X Individual Target Bonus Percentage X Bonus Payout Factor = Bonus Payout 
Individual Target Bonus Percentage. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee set target percentages of 150% of base salary for our Chief Executive Officer and between 90%-100% of base salary for our other NEOs. The Compensation Committee selected these target bonus percentages to ensure that a substantial portion of each NEO's cash compensation is performance-based and linked directly to our business performance, and to ensure that total compensation is competitive with those in similar positions within our peer group. Setting our Chief Executive Officer's target at 150% also ties the majority of his cash compensation directly to Company performance. 
Bonus Payout Factor. For fiscal 2018, we based the Bonus Payout Factor for the applicable quarterly bonus period on our OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth compared to the same quarter in the prior year. While our executive performance incentive plan contains quarterly performance targets, the Compensation Committee designed this plan to drive long-term performance. The targets are directly linked to our long-term corporate strategy of profitable growth, which drives shareholder value. We believe this combination ensures that we encourage a long-term focus on our business objectives, while measuring and rewarding progress against those objectives on a quarterly basis. 
The Compensation Committee may adjust the OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth metrics in its sole discretion to exclude special items such as (but not limited to) restructuring-related expense, acquisition-related expense, amortization of intangibles, gain or loss on disposition of businesses, non-recurring royalty payments, and other similar non-cash or non-recurring items. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, exclude these items in order to prevent payments under the plan from being adversely or advantageously affected by special items. For purposes of determining the Bonus Payout Factor for each quarter of fiscal 2018, OPBT margin was adjusted to exclude acquisition-related expenses, acquisition-related transaction costs, restructuring-related expenses and accelerated stock-based compensation expense, consistent with the non-GAAP adjustments included in our fiscal 2018 quarterly earnings releases. The Compensation Committee also normalized the financial results of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which was a 14-week quarter, to a 13-week quarter. The financial results for Linear Technology were also excluded when determining the Bonus Payout Factors for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 while Mr. Pietkiewicz and the other legacy Linear Technology employees remained on the legacy Linear Technology incentive compensation plans. We aligned the compensation of our executives and legacy ADI and Linear Technology employees commencing the second half of fiscal 2018, and as such, the financial results of Linear Technology were included in the Bonus Payout Factor calculations for the second half of fiscal 2018. ADI executive and employee bonuses for the second half of fiscal 2018 were calculated using the same plan targets. 
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves our performance targets, and historically these targets have not been re-set during the performance period, regardless of Company performance or economic conditions. We believe that this approach fosters accountability for our business results and is in keeping with our core belief that variable compensation expense, which increases when our performance is good and contracts when it is poor, gives us maximum flexibility to operate our business. While the OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth targets are typically set annually, we measure performance against those targets on a quarterly basis, applying the corresponding Bonus Payout Factor to base salary for that quarter, and pay the bonus amounts on a semi-annual basis following the end of the second and fourth quarters. 
44    Analog Devices, Inc. 
In setting performance targets for our executive performance incentive plans, multiple factors are considered including our actual past business results, estimates of multi-year performance from our long-term strategic planning, and the performance of market competitors. Based on our evaluation of these factors, we develop a range of performance scenarios and then set goals at threshold, target and maximum performance levels. Based on analyses of our peer group performance over the past three years, as presented by our Compensation Committee's independent consultant, Pearl Meyer, our OPBT margin targets (30% for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and 39% for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018) were well above our peer group median performance, while our annual growth rate targets (8% for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and 5% for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018) were well aligned with our peer group median performance. We increased the OPBT margin targets and decreased the annual growth rate targets for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 to align both with the financial profile of the combined company following the acquisition of Linear Technology and our Company's post-acquisition long-term financial model, which we announced at our Investor Day in June 2017. 
Fiscal 2018 was a year in which we had excellent financial results and exceeded our profitability and year-over-year growth targets. For a summary of our fiscal 2018 financial results, see page 48 of this proxy statement. For fiscal 2018, the calculated OPBT Margin, Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth and Bonus Payout Factor under our executive performance incentive program for each quarter were as follows:

Equity Compensation 
Our equity compensation program is a broad-based, long-term employee rewards program that is intended to attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers and directors and to align their interests with 
2019 Proxy Statement    45 
those of our shareholders. We believe that our equity program is critical to our efforts to hire and retain the best talent in the extremely competitive analog semiconductor industry. All equity awards granted to our executive officers are made under the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. 
For fiscal 2018, the value of our annual equity awards to our NEOs was comprised of approximately 33% of performance-based RSUs, which have a three-year performance period and vest in one installment 14 days after the third anniversary of the grant date subject to the achievement of applicable performance metrics; approximately 33% of time-based RSUs that vest in four equal installments on the anniversaries of the grant date; and approximately 33% of stock options that vest in four equal installments on the anniversaries of the grant date. Because the value of the awards is based on our stock price and our stock price appreciation, stock options, time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs encourage recipients to focus on achievement of longer-term goals, such as strategic opportunities, technological innovation and shareholder return. 
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. Our equity compensation program includes performance-based RSUs for our executives to ensure that a direct link exists between the value of our long-term incentives and the value that is created for our shareholders. The number of shares of ADI common stock received by an executive officer following vesting of the performance-based RSUs will range from 0% to a maximum of 200% of the target amount based on ADI's TSR performance measured against the median TSR of an established comparator group over a three-year period, capped at a maximum of 100% of the initial number of performance-based RSUs granted if the Company's TSR is negative. The performance parameters established by the Compensation Committee are equal to 100% plus or minus two times the difference between the Company's TSR and the comparator group median TSR. Attainment among performance parameters is subject to interpolation on a linear basis. The performance-based RSUs granted on March 11, 2015 had a three-year performance period that ended on March 11, 2018. The comparative peer group consisted of Broadcom Limited, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Nvidia Corp., Qorvo, Inc., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Xilinx, Inc. On a three-year cumulative basis, our TSR performance was 50.83%, compared to the median comparative peer group TSR of 78.46%. The median comparative peer group TSR performance exceeded the Company's TSR performance, which resulted in a payout percentage of 44.74% of target. 
The comparator group designated for the performance-based RSUs granted in fiscal 2018 consisted of the companies represented in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX Index) as of the grant date that are included in the SOX Index for the entire performance period. The Compensation Committee chose this comparator group because it consists of publicly traded companies, which compete in the semiconductor industry, are representative of likely alternative investment opportunities for our investors, compete with us for talent, and are similar to ADI in their product and services offerings and business models. Consistent with our Compensation Committee's desire to tie pay to performance, the value of each of these awards is directly linked to the long-term performance of our stock price. 
Stock Options. We use stock options as a way to reward long-term value creation. 
Time-Based Restricted Stock Units. In a volatile stock market, time-based RSUs continue to provide value when stock options may not, which the Compensation Committee believes will be useful in retaining talented executives and employees in uncertain economic times. In this way, we use time-based RSUs as a retention tool and to enable our executives to accumulate stock ownership in the Company. 
We set a goal each year to keep the shareholder dilution related to our equity compensation program to a certain percentage, calculated as the total number of shares of common stock underlying new equity grants made during the year, divided by the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock at the beginning of the year. Our gross and net dilution rate have been consistently lower than that of our peers over the past several years. For fiscal 2018, our gross dilution percentage was 0.6%, compared to an average of 1.1% for our peer group, and our net dilution percentage was 0.4%, compared to an average of 0.8% for our peers. For the last five years, our gross dilution percentage was 1.0% on average, compared to 1.6% on average for our peer group, and our net dilution percentage was 0.8% on average, compared to 1.0% on average for our peer group. For the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019, our Board of Directors set the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock with respect to which awards may be 
46    Analog Devices, Inc. 
granted under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, in the aggregate, at 3.7 million shares, which equals approximately 1.0% of our outstanding common stock at the end of fiscal 2018. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Under our guidelines, the target stock ownership levels are two times annual base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and one times annual base salary for other executive officers. The Chief Executive Officer has four years from the date of his appointment as CEO to achieve his targeted level. Executive officers other than the CEO have five years from the date he or she becomes an executive officer to achieve their targeted level. Shares subject to unexercised options, whether or not vested, will not be counted for purposes of satisfying these guidelines. RSUs (whether or not vested) are counted for purposes of satisfying the guidelines. All of our executive officers were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines as of the end of fiscal 2018. 
Retirement and Other Employee Benefits 
We maintain broad-based benefits for all employees, including health and dental insurance, life and disability insurance and retirement plans. Executives are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans on the same basis as our other employees. The retirement and other employee benefit component of our executive compensation program is designed to attract excellent candidates by providing financial protection and security, and reward our executives for the total commitment we expect from them in service to ADI. 
We maintain a Deferred Compensation Plan, or DCP, under which our executive officers and directors, along with a group of highly compensated management and engineering employees, are eligible to defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation. This plan offers many of the same investment options as our 401(k) plan. Under our DCP, we provide all participants (other than non-employee directors) with Company contributions equal to 8% of eligible deferred contributions. 
In the United States during fiscal 2018, we contributed to our 401(k) plan on behalf all legacy ADI participants, including our NEOs (other than Steve Pietkiewicz), amounts equal to 5% of the employee's eligible compensation, plus matching contributions up to an additional 3%, subject to Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, limits. For those employees who also participated in the DCP described above, any compensation that was deferred under that plan was not considered eligible compensation for purposes of our Company contributions under the 401(k) plan. We also provided employees who are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan but whose compensation is greater than the amount that may be taken into account in any plan year as a result of IRS limits ($275,000 for fiscal 2018), with a taxable payment equal to 8% of the employee's 401(k)-eligible compensation in excess of the IRS limit. 
Limited Perquisites 
We do not award extensive perquisites to our executive officers. In fiscal 2018, we provided a voluntary health services benefit to executives and reimbursement for financial and tax planning services of up to $15,000 for the Chief Executive Officer and up to $10,000 for the other executive officers. These items are detailed in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
We also maintain an expatriate program that provides certain benefits to our employees who accept expatriate assignments. Our executive officers are entitled to the same benefits under the Company's expatriate program as other Company employees. Under the Company's expatriate program, such benefits include providing gross-ups on taxable foreign assignment assistance and making tax equalization payments on behalf of (or to) expatriate employees who, as a result of their expatriate assignment, incur tax liabilities in excess of what they would have incurred had they not accepted the expatriate assignment. 
On occasion, and with the approval of our CEO, an officer or director may have his or her family members accompany him or her on the Company's leased airplane when traveling on business. The 
2019 Proxy Statement    47 
executive or director may incur taxable income for any such travel in accordance with applicable tax rules. We do not gross-up or in any way compensate the officer or director for any income tax owed for any such travel. 
Compensation Recovery 
Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in the event of misconduct that results in a financial restatement that would have reduced a previously paid incentive amount, we can recoup those improper payments from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. We will implement a broader clawback policy that is compliant with the regulations mandated under the Dodd-Frank Act when the regulations are adopted by the SEC and corresponding listing standards become effective.

• Profit Sharing. The Company funded a profit sharing program for all eligible legacy Linear Technology employees  based on the profitability of Linear Technology through May 5, 2018. The profit sharing payments made to Mr. Pietkiewicz for the first half of fiscal 2018 were calculated in the same manner as for the rest of the legacy Linear Technology  eligible employees, and the percentage of base salary the payments represented were the same for all such employees. For the first half of fiscal 2018, Mr. Pietkiewicz received profit sharing distributions equal to $63,826, of which $9,351 was  contributed to Mr. Pietkiewicz's 401(k).

• Retirement and Other Employee Benefits. We maintain broad-based benefits for legacy Linear Technology employees,  including health and dental insurance, life and disability insurance, and retirement plans. For fiscal 2018, Mr. Pietkiewicz was eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans on the same basis as our other legacy Linear  Technology employees, subject to applicable plan limits.  
[END TABLE]
Severance, Retention and Change in Control Benefits 
Change in Control Benefits 
We have entered into change in control retention agreements with each of our executive officers and other key employees. Among other things, these retention agreements provide for severance benefits if the employee's service with us is terminated within 24 months after a change in control (as defined in each agreement) that was approved by our Board of Directors. 
We designed the change in control retention agreements to help ensure that our executive team is able to evaluate objectively whether a potential change in control transaction is in the best interests of ADI and our shareholders, despite possible risks to their future employment. We believe that retaining the services of our key executives during a change in control scenario is critical. These agreements help ensure the continued services of our executive officers throughout the change in control transaction by giving them incentives to remain with us rather than seeking alternative employment or being recruited to a competitor during a highly uncertain time. The Compensation Committee reviewed prevalent market practices in determining the severance amounts and the events that trigger payments under the agreements. The Compensation Committee determined that the amounts and triggering events were appropriate and designed to encourage decision-making that is in the best interests of ADI. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee asked Pearl Meyer, its independent compensation consultant, to review our severance, retention and change in control arrangements and Pearl Meyer determined that those arrangements were competitive with existing market practice in the semiconductor industry and that it was appropriate to maintain the program for fiscal 2018. Change in control retention agreements entered into between the Company and eligible employees since 2009 do not contain excess parachute payment tax gross-up provisions. 
Mr. Pietkiewicz is also currently a party to a Linear Technology Change in Control Agreement that provides for severance benefits to Mr. Pietkiewicz in specified circumstances following termination of his employment on or before March 10, 2019. These benefits are described further below in "—Change in Control Benefits—Mr. Pietkiewicz's Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Agreement." 
Under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, in the event of a change in control, all of our employees, including our NEOs, if they remain employed by ADI, would have one-half of the shares of common stock subject to their then outstanding unvested options accelerate and become immediately exercisable and one-half of their unvested RSUs would vest. The remaining one-half of their unvested options and RSUs would continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedules, and any remaining unvested options and RSUs would vest if, on or prior to the first anniversary of the change in control, his or her employment is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" (as defined in the plan). We have provided more detailed information about these benefits, along with estimates of their value under various circumstances, under the caption "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below.

Severance Benefits 
When the employment of an executive officer terminates in a situation that does not involve a change in control, the officer is entitled to receive the same benefits as any other terminated employee in that geographical location. 
Equity Award Grant Date Policy 
Our Compensation Committee has adopted specific policies regarding the grant dates of stock options, RSUs and other stock-based awards for our executive officers and employees. In each case, the exercise price of stock options equals the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Hire Grants: The grant date of all awards to newly hired executive officers and employees is the 15th day of the month after the date on which the individual commences employment with us (or the next succeeding business day that Nasdaq is open).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Grants: The grant date of all annual awards is the earlier to occur of (i) the scheduled date of the  annual meeting of shareholders, or (ii) the first business day of April that Nasdaq is open. In connection with the harmonization of the compensation programs of Analog Devices and Linear Technology, the Board of Directors approved moving the  grant date for the fiscal 2018 annual awards from March 14, 2018 to March 29, 2018, to align the grant date with the one-time shift in timing of the Company's worldwide annual employee  compensation review process.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Grants: All other awards granted to existing executive officers and employees throughout the year (off-cycle awards) have a grant date of the 15th day of the month (or the next succeeding business day that Nasdaq is open) provided the award is approved on or  prior to such grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Foreign Registrations: Any awards requiring registration or approval in a foreign jurisdiction will have a grant  date of the 15th day of the month (or the next succeeding business day that Nasdaq is open) following the effective date of that registration or approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Blackout Periods: Our Compensation Committee does not approve off-cycle  awards to our executive officers during the quarterly and annual blackout periods under our insider trading policy. The quarterly and annual blackout periods begin three weeks before the end of each fiscal quarter and end at the beginning of the  second full trading day after we announce our quarterly earnings.  
[END TABLE]
We describe the equity award grant date policy for our non-employee directors above under "Corporate Governance—Director Compensation." 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain of the Company's executives. Pursuant to the Tax Act, for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the group of executives whose compensation is subject to the deduction limitation is broader than under prior law. For fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, certain compensation, including qualified performance-based compensation, was not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Pursuant to the Tax Act, subject to certain transition rules, for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, the performance-based compensation exception to the deduction limitations under Section 162(m) is no longer available. For fiscal 2018 (which began before the Tax Act changes to Section 162(m) became effective), the Compensation Committee structured the annual bonus compensation program for its executives in a manner intended to be exempt from the deduction limitation under Section 162(m) as performance-based compensation. For fiscal 2019 and future tax years, subject to the transition rules, all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the specified executives will not be deductible. 
Mr. Roche has a change in control retention agreement that contains provisions regarding Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Since 2009, any new executive compensation arrangements for new executives do not contain tax gross up provisions for excess parachute payments. 
2019 Proxy Statement    53 
We expense in our financial statements the compensation that we pay to our executive officers, as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As one of many factors, the Compensation Committee considers the financial statement impact in determining the amount of, and allocation among the elements of, compensation. We account for stock-based compensation under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Plan and the 2010 Plan (the latter two of which we assumed in the Linear Technology acquisition), as well as all predecessor plans, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Risk Considerations in Our Compensation Program 
In fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee reviewed our incentive compensation programs, discussed the concept of risk as it relates to our compensation program, considered various mitigating factors and reviewed these items with its independent consultant, Pearl Meyer. In addition, our Compensation Committee asked Pearl Meyer to conduct an independent risk assessment of our executive compensation program. Based on these reviews and discussions, the Compensation Committee does not believe that any risks arising from our employee compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. Our Compensation Committee believes that any such risks are mitigated by the following factors, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We structure our pay to consist of both fixed and variable compensation with short- and long-term horizons. We feel that  the variable elements of compensation, which represented 90% and 81% of the total target compensation for our CEO and other NEOs (excluding Mr. Pietkiewicz), respectively, for fiscal 2018, are a sufficient percentage of overall compensation to  motivate executives to produce superior short- and long-term corporate results and to achieve Company goals, while the fixed element is also sufficiently high that the executives are not encouraged to take unnecessary or excessive risks in doing so.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe that our focus on both OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue growth through our executive performance incentive  plan, and stock price performance through our equity compensation program, provides a check on excessive risk taking. That is, even if our executives could inappropriately increase OPBT margin or revenue by excessively reducing expenses or adding  new revenue sources that are inconsistent with our business model, this could ultimately harm our stock price and the value of their equity awards. Conversely, if our executives were to add revenue sources at low margins in order to generate a  higher growth multiple and increased stock prices, it could decrease OPBT margin and the value of their cash bonus payments. Our OPBT margin and year-over-year revenue targets are applicable to our executives and employees alike, which we believe  encourages consistent behavior across the organization, and reflect goals that are challenging, but not so high that they require performance outside of what the Compensation Committee believes is reasonable for us or could motivate our executives  and employees to take actions in which we assume unreasonable levels of risk.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We cap our bonus payout factors. Even if we dramatically exceed our OPBT margin or year-over-year revenue growth targets,  bonus payments are limited. In fiscal 2018, the bonus payment factor cap was 300% of target. Conversely, we also have a floor on the OPBT margin target so that profitability below a certain level will result in no bonus payments, regardless of  revenue growth levels. We believe this avoids incentivizing management to drive revenue levels without regard to profitability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our stock ownership guidelines provide an incentive for management to consider ADI's long-term interests because a  portion of their personal investment portfolio consists of ADI stock.

Entries above with single asterisks (*) are time-based RSUs, entries with double asterisks (**) are performance-based RSUs, entries with triple asterisks (***) are Linear Integration PRSUs and entries without asterisks are stock options. The grant date fair value of time-based RSUs represents the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. The grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model which utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant to calculate the fair market value. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. The grant date fair value of Linear Integration PRSUs represents the value of our common stock as of

For a more detailed description of the assumptions used for purposes of determining grant date fair value, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates —Stock-Based Compensation," included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 3, 2018.

(1)  The amounts shown for Messrs. Roche, Mahendra-Rajah, Cotter, and Hassett in the threshold, target and maximum columns  reflect the minimum, target and maximum amounts payable under our executive performance incentive plan, respectively. Amounts in the maximum column above reflect 300% of the executive's target bonus, which is the cap under the plan.  Mr. Pietkiewicz did not participate in the executive performance incentive plan for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 as he participated in the Linear Technology profit sharing program and Linear Technology Corporation Executive  Bonus Plan during that time period. As part of the alignment of the compensation of our legacy ADI and Linear Technology executives and employees, Mr. Pietkiewicz ceased participating in the Linear Technology profit sharing program and Linear  Technology Corporation Executive Bonus at the end of the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2018 and participated in the Corporation's executive performance incentive plan for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Amounts for  Mr. Pietkiewicz represent the minimum, target and maximum amounts payable under the Linear Technology profit sharing program and the Linear Technology Executive Bonus Plan for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 and the minimum, target  and maximum amounts payable under the executive performance incentive plan for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018.

Performance-based RSUs have both a market  condition and a service condition and vest, so long as the executive continues to be employed with us, after the applicable three-year performance period. The number of shares of the Company's common stock to be issued upon vesting of  performance-based RSUs will range from 0% to 200% of the target amount, based on the comparison of the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) to the median TSR of a specified peer group over a three-year period.

(6)  This amount does not represent the actual amount paid to or realized by the executives for these awards during the fiscal  year. This amount represents the grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs. The grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model which utilizes multiple input variables that  determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the award grant to calculate the fair market value. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of  satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. The grant date fair value per share of the performance-based RSU awards granted to Messrs.  Roche, Mahendra-Rajah, Cotter, Hassett and Pietkiewicz on March 29, 2018 was $101.23.

(7)  This amount does not represent the actual amount paid to or realized by the executives for these awards during the fiscal  year. This amount represents the grant date fair value of the time-based RSUs. The grant date fair of the time-based RSUs is the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our  common stock prior to vesting. The grant date fair value per share of the time-based RSU awards granted to Messrs. Roche, Mahendra-Rajah, Cotter, Hassett and Pietkiewicz on March 29, 2018 was $86.51. The grant date fair value per share of the  time-based RSU awards granted to Mr. Pietkiewicz on June 15, 2018 was $96.90. The grant date fair value per share of the time-based RSU awards granted to Messrs. Cotter and Hassett on September 17, 2018 was $86.72.

(8)  This amount does not represent the actual amount paid to or realized by the executives for these awards during the fiscal  year. The grant date fair value of these stock options granted on March 29, 2018 was $20.83 per share and was computed using a Black-Scholes valuation methodology. We estimated the full grant date fair value of these stock options using the  following assumptions: 2.64% risk free interest rate; 2.11% dividend yield; 27.77% expected volatility; and a 5-year expected life.

Since 1995, our executive officers and directors, along with some of our management and engineering employees, have been eligible to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan, or DCP. We established the DCP to provide participants with the opportunity to defer receiving all or a portion of their compensation, which includes salary, bonus, commissions and director fees. Under our DCP, we provide all participants (other than non-employee directors) with Company contributions equal to 8% of eligible deferred contributions. 
We credit each participant's account with earnings on the deferred amounts. These earnings represent the amounts that the participant would have earned if the deferred amounts had been invested in one or more of the various investment options selected by the participant. Under the terms of the DCP, only the payment of the compensation earned is deferred; we do not defer the expense in our financial statements related to the participant's deferred compensation and investment earnings. We charge the salary, bonuses, commissions, director fees and investment earnings on deferred balances to our income statement as an expense in the period in which the participant earned the compensation. Our balance sheet includes separate line items for Deferred Compensation Plan Investments and Deferred Compensation Plan Liabilities. 
We hold DCP assets in a separate Rabbi trust segregated from other assets. We invest in the same investment alternatives that the DCP participants select for their DCP balances. Participants whose employment with us terminates due to retirement after reaching age 62 with ten years of service, disability or death will be paid their DCP balance in either a lump sum or in installments over ten or fewer years, based on the elections they have made. Participants (other than key employees, including our NEOs) who terminate their employment with us for any other reason will receive payment of their DCP balance in the form of a lump sum upon their termination of employment. Payments to our NEOs and key employees will be delayed six months and as otherwise required by relevant tax regulations.

CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS 
Change in Control Retention Agreements 
We have entered into change in control retention agreements with each of our executive officers and other key employees. These agreements provide for severance benefits if any of the following occurs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• within 24 months after a change in control (as defined in each agreement) that was approved by our Board of Directors, we  terminate the employee's employment with us for a reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or the employee's death or disability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• within 24 months after a change in control that was approved by our Board of Directors, the employee terminates his or her  employment for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement); or  
[END TABLE]

• within 12 months after a change in control that was not approved by our Board of Directors, we or the employee terminate  the employee's employment with us for a reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or the employee's death or disability.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of our change in control retention agreements, a "change in control" occurs when: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the combined voting power of our outstanding  securities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our shareholders approve specified mergers of ADI with another entity; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our shareholders approve a plan of liquidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of ADI's assets.   
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement    63 
These agreements provide for the following severance benefits in the event of termination following a change in control approved by the Board of Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum payment equal to 200% (299% in the case of certain employees who are  parties to the agreements, including each of our NEOs) of the sum of the employee's annual base salary (as of the date of termination or the date of the change in control, whichever is higher) plus 200% (299% in the case of certain employees  who are parties to the agreements, including each of our NEOs) of the total cash bonuses paid or awarded to him or her in the four fiscal quarters preceding his or her termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of all legal fees and expenses incurred by the employee as a result of such termination (including all such fees  and expenses, if any, incurred in disputing such termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided by the agreement or in connection with tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of  Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code to any payment or benefit provided under the agreement); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the continuation of life, disability, dental, accident and group health insurance benefits for a period of 24 months.   
[END TABLE]
If payments to the employee under his or her agreement (together with any other payments or benefits, including the accelerated vesting of stock options or restricted stock awards that the employee receives in connection with a change in control) would trigger the provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the change in control employee retention agreements provide for the payment of an additional amount so that the employee receives, net of excise taxes, the amount he or she would have been entitled to receive in the absence of the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. In September 2009, our Compensation Committee eliminated this provision from any new employee retention agreements. 
Each agreement provides that, in the event of a potential change in control (as defined in each agreement), the employee will not voluntarily resign as an employee, subject to certain conditions, for at least six months after the change in control occurs. The Compensation Committee reviews these agreements each year, and the agreements automatically renew each year unless we give the employee three months' notice that his or her agreement will not be extended. 
Mr. Pietkiewicz's Analog Devices Change in Control Retention Agreement also provides that if a termination of his employment occurs under circumstances that would entitle him to receive severance benefits under such agreement as well as severance benefits under his Linear Technology Corporation Change of Control Severance Agreement (described below), then he is entitled to receive the greater of the severance benefits provided for in the Analog Devices Change in Control Retention Agreement and any similar severance benefits (accrued compensation, base salary, cash bonuses and insurance benefits) of the Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Agreement, as applicable. 
Mr. Pietkiewicz's Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Agreement 
Mr. Pietkiewicz is also party to a Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Agreement, which provides that, if the Company terminates his employment without "cause" (as defined in the agreement) or he terminates his employment for "good reason" (also as defined in the agreement) and, in either case, such termination occurs on or before March 10, 2019 (the second anniversary of Linear Technology's change in control), then, subject to Mr. Pietkiewicz signing and not revoking a separation agreement and mutual release of claims and his continued compliance with the terms of his confidential information and invention assignment agreement, he will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% of Mr. Pietkiewicz's annual base salary as  in effect immediately prior to his termination date or, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the change of control of Linear Technology;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to 100% of Mr. Pietkiewicz's bonus amount, which is  generally defined as the annualized average of the bonuses paid to Mr. Pietkiewicz over two years of completed bonus periods prior to his termination (or prior to the  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accelerated vesting of 75% of Mr. Pietkiewicz's then-unvested equity awards that were assumed by the Company in  connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reimbursement of Mr. Pietkiewicz's COBRA premiums for himself and his eligible dependents for a maximum period of  12 months, if he elects continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA.  
[END TABLE]
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Payments upon a change in control for our NEOs are calculated based upon the change-in-control retention agreements described above under "Change in Control Benefits—Change in Control Retention Agreements" or "Change in Control Benefits—Mr. Pietkiewicz's Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Agreement." Under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, in the event of a change in control, employees who have outstanding and unvested awards under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, including our NEOs, if they remain employed by ADI, would have one-half of the shares of common stock subject to their then-outstanding unvested options accelerate and become immediately exercisable and one-half of their unvested time- and performance-based RSUs would vest. The remaining one-half of the unvested options and time- and performance-based RSUs would continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedules, and any remaining unvested options or time- and performance-based RSUs would vest if, on or prior to the first anniversary of the change in control, his or her employment is terminated without cause or for good reason (as defined in the plan). 
Upon a change in control approved by the Board of Directors, if we terminate an executive officer's employment for cause or if the executive officer terminates his or her employment other than for good reason, then the executive officer will receive his or her full base salary and all other compensation through the date of termination at the rate in effect at the time that the termination notice is given and we will have no further obligations to the executive officer. When the employment of an executive officer terminates in a situation that does not involve a change in control, the officer is entitled to receive the same benefits as any other terminating employee. This applies regardless of the reason for termination. 
2019 Proxy Statement    65 
The following tables quantify the amounts that would be payable to the NEOs named in the Summary Compensation Table upon termination of their employment. The amounts shown assume that the terminations were effective on the last day of our fiscal year, or November 3, 2018. The tables do not include the accumulated benefit under our DCP that would be paid to our NEOs described above under "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan," or any other employee benefits, except to the extent that the officer is entitled to an additional benefit as a result of the termination. In addition, the tables do not include the value of vested but unexercised stock options held by each executive as of November 3, 2018. The actual amounts that would be paid out would depend on which options were exercised and, therefore, can only be determined at the time of the executive officer's termination of employment.

(3)  The value of accelerated unvested options as of November 3, 2018 is calculated by taking the difference between the  closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq on the last trading day of the fiscal year ($87.18 on November 2, 2018) and the option exercise price and multiplying it by the number of accelerated options. For time- and performance-based  RSUs/RSAs the value represents the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of the fiscal year multiplied by the number of accelerated units. For performance-based RSUs, the number of accelerated units assumes vesting at the target  level. Accelerated cash awards are equal to 100% of the award.

RSAs assumed by the Company in connection  with the acquisition of Linear Technology for Mr. Pietkiewicz were granted under the Linear 2010 Equity Plan and 75% would accelerate upon termination without cause or by Mr. Pietkiewicz for good reason following a change in control.

(5)  Amounts include life, disability, dental, accident and group health insurance benefit continuation for 24 months after a  termination in connection with a change in control. The annual benefit costs for each executive are: $12,995 for Messrs. Roche and Cotter, $20,296 for Mr. Mahendra-Rajah, $14,208 for Mr. Hassett and $23,569 for Mr. Pietkiewicz.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  In calculating the excise tax gross-up amounts, we take into account  Mr. Roche's earnings from ADI for the prior five years. We include the change in control cash severance and bonus, valuations of unvested stock options that become vested upon a change in control (using the fiscal 2018 year-end closing stock price), valuations of time-based and performance-based RSUs that become vested upon a change in control (using the fiscal 2018 year-end closing stock  price), and our estimated cost of medical and other benefits. Whether Mr. Roche will receive a gross-up amount will depend primarily on his earnings in the previous five years, which will vary depending  on stock option exercise activity and amounts of salary and incentives deferred under the DCP. Since 2009, our executive compensation arrangements for new executives do not contain tax gross up provisions for excess parachute payments.   
[END TABLE]

(7)  Under the terms of the Linear Technology Corporation Change in Control Agreement, if the Company terminates  Mr. Pietkiewicz's employment without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason on or before March 10, 2019 (the second anniversary of Linear Technology's change in control), then he will receive: a lump sum payment  equal to 100% of his annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to his termination date; a lump sum payment equal to 100% of his bonus amount; accelerated vesting of 75% of his unvested equity awards assumed by the Company in connection with  the acquisition of Linear Technology; and life, disability, dental, accident and group health insurance benefit continuation for 12 months after a termination in connection with a change in control.

CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of Vincent Roche, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system of records and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio 
2019 Proxy Statement    67 
reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
To identify the median employee and to determine such employee's annual total compensation, we used the following methodology and material assumptions, adjustments and estimates: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected November 1, 2018, as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee."   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We used our global employee population as of this date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the median employee, we used annual base salary and target bonus (or sales incentive) at a target of 1.0x of  annual base salary. Base salaries were annualized for all permanent employees who were employees for less than the full fiscal year and not on an unpaid leave of absence as of the identification date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We identified and calculated the elements of the median employee's total compensation for fiscal 2018 in accordance  with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We applied the exchange rate that we utilize in our accounting system, as of our fiscal year end (November 3, 2018), to  convert foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  
[END TABLE]
For fiscal 2018, the annual total compensation of the median employee of Analog Devices (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $53,821. The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer for fiscal 2018 was $11,007,691, which is the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 55. Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was approximately 205 to 1. 
EQUITY AWARD PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
Our equity award program is a broad-based, long-term employee retention program that is intended to attract, retain and motivate our employees, officers and directors and to align their interests with those of our shareholders. Under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, we may grant options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to all employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of ADI. All stock options have a term of ten years, and for employees, generally vest in four equal installments on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to full or partial acceleration upon death, disability or a change in control. The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan does not permit us to grant options at exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Generally, our employee time-based RSUs vest in four equal installments on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Our performance-based RSUs have three year performance periods under which the number of shares of ADI common stock received following vesting, if any, will be based on ADI's TSR performance measured against the median TSR of a comparator group of companies over the three-year period. RSUs granted under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan are subject to full or partial acceleration upon death, disability or a change in control. 
Under our 2010 Plan, which we assumed as part of the Linear Technology acquisition, we may grant options to purchase shares of our common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards to legacy Linear employees. All stock options have a term of ten years, and for employees, generally vest in four equal installments on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to full or partial acceleration upon death or disability. The 2010 Plan does not permit us to grant options at exercise prices that are below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Generally, our employee time-based RSUs vest in four equal installments on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. RSUs under the 2010 Plan are subject to full or partial acceleration upon death or disability. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the treatment of outstanding awards under the 2010 Plan in the event of a change in control. 
68    Analog Devices, Inc. 
As part of the Linear Technology acquisition, we also assumed the 2005 Plan and converted certain outstanding Linear RSU and restricted stock awards based on share exchange ratios determined in accordance with the merger agreement. The resulting Company stock-based award (either an RSU or an RSA) continue to vest on the same schedule provided under the original Linear RSU or Linear RSA, as applicable. The Company is not granting new awards under the 2005 Plan. RSUs and RSAs under the 2005 Plan are subject to full or partial acceleration upon death or disability. The Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the treatment of outstanding awards under the 2005 Plan in the event of a change in control. 
We can make equity award grants to executive officers and directors only from shareholder-approved plans after the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the grants. All members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors, as defined by the Nasdaq Rules.

(4)  In connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology in March 2017, we assumed the 2005 Plan and the 2010 Plan and  issued 2.8 million RSU and RSA awards, in the aggregate, in replacement of outstanding and unvested Linear Technology equity awards under such plans. The 2010 Plan allows for the future issuance of up to 2.9 million additional shares of  our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Employee Service Award Program 
Our Employee Service Award Program is designed to recognize and thank employees for their long-term working relationship with ADI. All regular employees other than executive officers are eligible to receive these awards in the form of shares of our common stock. Our executive officers receive these awards in cash instead of stock. We grant these awards to employees starting with the employee's tenth anniversary 
2019 Proxy Statement    69 
of employment with us, and after the tenth anniversary, we grant the awards at the end of each subsequent five-year period of employment with us. The value of the award at the employee's tenth anniversary with us is $1,000 and the value of the award increases by $500 at each subsequent five-year service milestone. The number of shares awarded to an eligible employee is equal to the dollar value of the award divided by the closing per share price of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq on a specified date. The shares awarded are issued under our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. Our Board of Directors may terminate, amend or suspend the program at any time at its discretion. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During fiscal 2018, Mr. Novich and Drs. Frank and Su served as members of our Compensation Committee. No member of our Compensation Committee was at any time during fiscal 2018, or formerly, an officer or employee of ADI or any subsidiary of ADI. No member of our Compensation Committee had any relationship with us during fiscal 2018 requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
During fiscal 2018, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any entity that had one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with our management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. To execute this responsibility, the Audit Committee engages in an annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence and whether the retention of the independent public accounting firm is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders. 
Our Audit Committee has selected the firm of Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as our auditors for the 2019 fiscal year. We have engaged Ernst & Young LLP, or its predecessor firms, to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 1967. Through Ernst & Young LLP's years of experience with ADI, Ernst & Young LLP has gained institutional knowledge of and deep expertise regarding ADI's global operations, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting, which enables efficiency with the annual audit and benefits the Company. In accordance with SEC rules and Ernst & Young LLP policies, the firm's lead engagement partner rotates every five years. Our Audit Committee and its Chairman are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young LLP's lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee also has the sole authority to approve all engagement fees paid to our independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders, and we are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Although shareholder approval of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP is not required by law, our Board of Directors believes that it is advisable to give shareholders an opportunity to ratify this selection. If this proposal is not approved by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting, our Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will also be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
 Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL RELATING TO A DIVERSITY REPORT 
Trillium Asset Management, LLC, located at Two Financial Center, 60 South Street, Suite 1100, Boston, MA 02111, has advised us that they plan to introduce the following resolution at this year's Annual Meeting on behalf of the Episcopal City Mission and Sundance Family Foundation, who have indicated that they beneficially own 2,609 shares and 46 shares of our common stock, respectively. The Company is not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal, which is presented as received from the proponent in accordance with SEC rules. As explained below, our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "AGAINST" this shareholder proposal. 
DIVERSITY REPORT 
WHEREAS: The business case for workforce diversity is compelling. McKinsey & Company, for example, found in 2015, and in a larger study in 2017 that highly diverse executive teams had higher returns on equity and earnings performance than those with low diversity. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 21 percent more likely to have industry-leading profitability. Companies in the top quartile for ethnic/cultural diversity were 33 percent more likely to have industry-leading profitability. 
Further, the lack of diversity among high tech workers is a central public policy concern according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In 2014, the Commission reported that the high-tech sector employed a larger share of whites, Asian Americans, and men, and a smaller share of African-Americans, Hispanics and women than the "overall private industry." 
Analog Devices states that it has "become the world leader in high performance signal processing solutions by ensuring that we not only have the best products in the industry, but the best people." Yet, no information is provided describing how its business strategy of delivering the best product is aligned with a strategy to attract and retain top talent to serve its diverse, global customer base. 
Sector peers including Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and Adobe Systems publish EEO-1 data and disclosure inclusion and diversity strategies. Intel set targets for raising the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in their workforce. Symantec created a sub-goal of increasing its percentage of women in leadership (Director-level and above) to 30 percent by 2020. Financial services sector companies, similarly, have begun setting diversity targets. Citigroup, in August 2018, announced plans to reverse "falling diversity" by setting public quantitative goals and holding senior leaders accountable for meeting them. 
Global companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion as business and social imperatives. Leveraging the contributions of a diverse employee population creates an environment in which individual differences and capabilities are valued. Further, operationalizing an effective inclusion and diversity strategy requires inclusive leadership and goal setting. Companies that hold themselves publicly accountable to diversity goals are more likely to make rapid progress toward achieving those goals. 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Analog Devices prepare a diversity report, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential information, available to investors including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  A chart identifying employees according to gender and race in major EEOC-defined job categories, listing numbers or  percentages in each category;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  A description of policies/programs focused on increasing diversity in the workplace.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess strategy and performance would include disclosures, such as a review of appropriate time-bound benchmarks for judging 
72    Analog Devices, Inc. 
current and future progress, and practices in use to ensure progress can be achieved, for example, the extent to which incentive compensation packages include diversity and inclusion goals for named executive officers. 
COMPANY'S OPPOSITION STATEMENT 
The Analog Devices Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: 
ANALOG DEVICES' COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION 
Analog Devices is a global company with design, development, field application engineering, sales, and manufacturing employees and facilities worldwide. We believe that our more than 15,000 employees worldwide are one of our most valuable assets. We want people whose diverse backgrounds open our "innovation aperture" and allow ADI to think differently, come at complex problems from many different vantage points, and find the best possible solutions. Consistent with this belief, we are committed to ensuring that our employees are treated with respect and dignity in order to drive a culture of inclusion that values and leverages the uniqueness and broad perspective of each employee. Diversity and inclusion are recognized as critical business imperatives at ADI. When people feel appreciated and included, they can be more creative, innovative and successful, which in turn drives the success of ADI and enhanced value for you, our shareholders. Our more than fifty years of success is a testament to our commitment to developing a highly productive, talented and motivated global workforce. 
The integration of diversity and inclusion into our organization is demonstrated by our appointment of a Director of Diversity and Inclusion who reports up through our Senior Director of Talent into the Chief People Officer, an executive officer of ADI, demonstrating cross functional integration and access to the highest governing level of the Company. 
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PROGRAMS AT ADI 
Our commitment to diversity is reflected in the Company's diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives, which include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Inclusion Program. This is a company-wide initiative to educate all our employees about the business benefits of  inclusion. Through this initiative, employees receive unconscious bias training, and we will track throughout the year the actions our teams will be taking to be a more inclusive workforce. We believe that by helping our employees begin to  recognize, acknowledge and potentially minimize potential blind spots with respect to unconscious biases, we may continue building a culture of inclusion in which diverse perspectives and voices are heard and thrive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay it Forward. This is a program open to high performing or high potential women at ADI to help with mobility into  higher grades by providing them with a mentor. In exchange, we mobilize these women to help increase the pool size of female applicants by sending them to different university programs, providing them a female intern over the summer, and encouraging  the participants to find other ways of paying it forward. Many participants volunteer with their local schools to help with STEM initiatives and other community-based projects.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversity Networks. Our global employee diversity networks are voluntary organizations led by a team of employees  dedicated to fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment. Open to all employees, the networks aim to assist the Company in fostering the retention, development and success of our employees by connecting employees with one another and  providing mentoring, learning and development opportunities. The Company's current diversity networks include the Women's Leadership Network, the Young Professional Network and the LGBT+ Network.

DATA REQUESTED BY SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL 
The shareholder proposal requests that we create a report including, among other things, a chart identifying U.S. employees according to gender and race in major EEOC-defined job categories, listing numbers or percentages in each category. As a government contractor, the Company files this information annually with the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) for its U.S.-based employee population on a confidential Form EEO-1. This confidential form requires companies to categorize their U.S. workforce solely by gender and race according to EEOC-defined generalized job categories that are applied across a broad variety of industries and companies. 
We agree with our shareholder proponent that reporting diversity metrics is appropriate, however, we also believe that such reporting should be meaningful and reflective of ADI as a truly global employer. For purposes of the EEO-1 report, we ask our U.S. employees to voluntarily self-identify their race and ethnicity, and we do not obtain information on the race and ethnicity of our employees outside of the United States. Because we are a global organization with more than half of our employee population outside the United States, we do not believe that presenting U.S.-only information is useful to investors and other constituents as it is not representative of the diversity of our global employee population. Furthermore, we do not believe that public dissemination of the EEO-1 reported information, which could be manipulated or misinterpreted by third parties, is appropriate, nor would it further promote or enhance ADI's serious commitment to diversity and inclusion in any meaningful way. We do, however, believe that presenting the metrics that our management team considers to be meaningful disclosure for our Company at this time is appropriate and will demonstrate to our shareholders our commitment to diversity in our workplace. We already include gender diversity metrics disclosure in the "Social Sustainability" section of our website. Led by our new Chief People Officer, our senior leadership team is also in the process of developing additional appropriate metrics to benchmark and monitor ADI's progress against our diversity objectives. 
We reviewed our current gender diversity metrics disclosure with our shareholder proponent, who did not accept it as responsive enough to their proposal and did not accept our invitation to meet and work with our Chief People Officer and her team to help develop the additional appropriate metrics.

SUMMARY 
In summary, the Company remains fully committed to our ongoing efforts to promote diversity and foster an inclusive environment for all employees throughout the Company, which we agree is critical for continued success. However, we do not believe that this shareholder proposal would advance those goals or serve to enhance our shareholders' understanding of our diversity and inclusion efforts and achievements. 
 Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Our Board of Directors does not know of any other matters that may come before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote, or otherwise act, in accordance with their judgment on such matters.

Non-GAAP financial measures included in this Proxy Statement are financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. 
Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company's core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company's earnings results and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's core business. 
Analog Devices believes that non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. In addition, our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The Company's use of non-GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. 
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: 
Acquisition-Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include severance payments, equity award accelerations and the fair value adjustment associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Linear Technology acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance. 
The following items are excluded from our non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: 
Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Linear Technology acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, as well as integration-related costs. We excluded these costs from our non-GAAP measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance. 
78    Analog Devices, Inc. 
Restructuring-Related Expense: These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, and other cost reduction efforts. We excluded these expenses from our non-GAAP measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. 
Accelerated Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for one of its former executive officers due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and stock options resulting from a reduction in the requisite service period for each in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements. This stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future. 
The following item is excluded from our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share: 
Tax-Related Items: Tax adjustments associated with the non-GAAP items discussed above. Discrete tax items including tax expense or benefit related to prior periods; tax benefits related to the release of a tax reserves for an expired tax years; the release of reserves associated with a favorable ruling on petitions with the U.S. Tax Court; tax expense or benefit from changes to state tax valuation allowances; tax expense associated with the remittance of cash held outside of the United States related to the post-acquisition integration of Linear Technology and tax expense related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-GAAP measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
