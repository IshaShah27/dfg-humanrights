You are invited to attend the Meeting at the above stated time and location.  If you plan to attend and your Timberline Shares are held in "street name" – in an account with a bank, broker, or other nominee – you must obtain a proxy issued in your name from such broker, bank or other nominee.

The Timberline Shares are the only type of security entitled to vote at the Meeting.  Our corporate bylaws define a quorum as the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the issued and outstanding Timberline Shares.  The approval of a majority of the votes actually cast for each matter at the Meeting, whether in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of Timberline's independent registered public accounting firm, approve the adoption of the 2018 Incentive Plan, and approve the AEGI Stock Purchase. The approval of a majority of the issued and outstanding Timberline Shares is required to approve the Name Change.
Proxy Solicitation
The proxy solicitation is being made primarily over the internet and by mail, although proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, internet, letter, e-mail or otherwise. Certain of our directors, officers and other employees, without additional compensation, may participate in the solicitation of proxies. We will pay the cost of this solicitation, including the reasonable charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others who forward solicitation materials to beneficial owners of Timberline Shares.

INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT
The information contained in this Proxy Statement, unless otherwise indicated, is given as of October 5, 2018.
No person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation in connection with the matters being considered herein on behalf of Timberline other than those contained in this Proxy Statement and, if given or made, such information or representation should not be considered or relied upon as having been authorized.  Information contained in this Proxy Statement should not be construed as legal, tax or financial advice and Stockholders are urged to consult their own professional advisors in connection with the matters considered in this Proxy Statement. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement and proxy card?
You are receiving this Proxy Statement and proxy card because you were a Stockholder of record at the close of business on October 2, 2018 and are entitled to vote at the Meeting.  This Proxy Statement describes issues on which Timberline would like you, as a Stockholder, to vote.  It provides information on these issues so that you can make an informed decision.  You do not need to attend the Meeting to vote your Timberline Shares.
When you sign the proxy card you appoint Steven Osterberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of Timberline, and Ted Sharp, Chief Financial Officer of Timberline, as your representatives at the Meeting.  As your representatives, they will vote your Timberline Shares at the Meeting (or any adjournments or postponements) as you have instructed on your proxy card.  With proxy voting, your Timberline Shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Meeting.  Even if you plan to attend the Meeting, it is a good idea to complete, sign and return your proxy card in advance of the Meeting, just in case your plans change.
If an issue properly comes up for vote at the Meeting (or any adjournments or postponements) that is not described in this Proxy Statement, your representative will vote your Timberline Shares, under your proxy, at their discretion, subject to any limitations imposed by law.
When is the record date?
The Board has fixed October 2, 2018 as the record date for the Meeting.  Only holders of Timberline Shares as of the close of business on that date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting.
How many Timberline Shares are outstanding?
As of October 2, 2018, Timberline had 53,527,819 Timberline Shares issued and outstanding.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 –   Attending the Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If your Timberline Shares are held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of Timberline Shares held in a "street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization.  The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Meeting.  As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote the Timberline Shares in your account.  You are also invited to attend the Meeting.  However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your Timberline Shares in person at the Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy card from your broker, bank, or other nominee.
Can Stockholders vote in person at the Meeting?
Timberline will pass out written ballots to anyone who wants to vote at the Meeting.  If you hold your Timberline Shares through a brokerage account but do not have a physical share certificate, or the Timberline Shares are registered in someone else's name, you must request a legal proxy from your stockbroker or the registered owner to vote at the Meeting.
What if I want a paper copy of these proxy materials?
Please send a written request to our offices at the address below, email us at proxy@timberline-resources.com or call us toll free at (866) 513-4859 to request a copy of the proxy materials.

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 –   Voting in person at the Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial stockholders should refer to the instructions received from their stockbroker or the registered holder of the Timberline Shares if they wish to change their vote. How many votes do you need to hold the Meeting?
To conduct the Meeting, Timberline must have a quorum, which means one-third of the outstanding voting shares of Timberline as of the record date must be present at the Meeting.  Timberline Shares are the only type of security entitled to vote at the Meeting.  Based on 53,527,819 voting shares outstanding as of the record date of October 2, 2018, 17,842,607 Timberline Shares must be present at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, for there to be a quorum.  Your Timberline Shares will be counted as present at the Meeting if you:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 –   Submit a properly executed proxy card (even if you do not provide voting instructions); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 –   Attend the Meeting and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
What if I abstain from voting?
Abstentions with respect to a proposal are counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum. Timberline's bylaws state that abstentions are not considered as votes cast for or against a proposal or as a vote withheld for any director nominee.
What effect does a broker non-vote have?
Brokers and other intermediaries, holding Timberline Shares in street name for their customers, are generally required to vote the Timberline Shares in the manner directed by their customers. If their customers do not give any direction, brokers may vote the Timberline Shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters.  The ratification of the appointment of Timberline's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year of 2019 and the Name Change are considered a routine matter and brokers will be permitted to vote shares held in street name for their customers.  The approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan and the AGEI Securities Purchase are non-routine matters and brokers will not be permitted to vote Timberline Shares in street name for their customers without direction.
The absence of a vote on a non-routine matter is referred to as a broker non-vote.  Any Timberline Shares represented at the Meeting but not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) are not considered votes cast for or against a proposal and will not affect the outcome of any proposal that requires the majority of votes cast on the matter at the Meeting to be approved.
How many votes are needed to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accountant?
The ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accountant will be approved if a majority of the votes cast, either in person or by proxy, at the Meeting on this proposal vote FOR the proposal.  A properly executed proxy card marked ABSTAIN will not count as a vote cast for or against this proposal.
How many votes are needed to approve the adoption of the 2018 Incentive Plan?
The adoption of the 2018 Incentive Plan will be approved if a majority of the votes cast, either in person or by proxy, at the Meeting on this proposal vote FOR the proposal.  A properly executed proxy card marked ABSTAIN will not count as a vote cast for or against this proposal.
How many votes are needed approve the AGEI Securities Purchase?
The AGEI Securities Purchase will be approved if a majority of the votes cast, either in person or by proxy, at the Meeting on this proposal vote FOR the proposal.  A properly executed proxy card marked ABSTAIN will not count as a vote cast for or against this proposal.
How many votes are needed approve the Name Change?
The Name Change will be approved if a majority of the issued and outstanding Timberline Shares vote FOR the proposal.  A properly executed proxy card marked ABSTAIN will count the same as a vote AGAINST this proposal. Will my Timberline Shares be voted if I do not sign and return my Proxy Card?
If your Timberline Shares are held through a brokerage account, your brokerage firm, under certain circumstances, may vote your shares; otherwise your Timberline Shares will not be voted at the meeting.  See "What effect does a broker non-vote have?" above for a discussion of the matters on which your brokerage firm may vote your Timberline Shares.
If your Timberline Shares are registered in your name, and you do not complete your proxy card over the internet or sign and return your proxy card, your Timberline Shares will not be voted at the Meeting unless you attend the Meeting and vote your Timberline Shares in person.
Where can I find the voting results of the Meeting?
Timberline will publish the final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC within four (4) business days of the Meeting.
Who will pay for the costs of soliciting proxies?
Timberline will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.  In an effort to have as large a representation at the meeting as possible, Timberline's directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone or in person in certain circumstances.  These individuals will receive no additional compensation for their services other than their regular salaries.  Upon request, Timberline will reimburse brokers, dealers, banks, voting trustees and their nominees who are holders of record of Timberline Shares on the record date for the reasonable expenses incurred for mailing copies of the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such Timberline Shares. 
When are stockholder proposals due for the 2019 annual meeting of Stockholders?  
In order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals must be submitted in writing to Timberline's Chief Executive Officer, Steven Osterberg, at Timberline Resources Corporation, 101 East Lakeside Avenue, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83814.  Since the Company did not hold an annual meeting in fiscal year 2018, shareholder proposals must be received no later than a reasonable time before the Company mails its proxies for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.  Since the Company has not selected a date for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, it is not currently known what date will constitute a reasonable time before the Company mails its proxies.  The Company anticipates filing a Form 8-K or disclosing in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q the deadline for shareholder proposals, including nominations to the Company's Board once the date of the 2019 annual meeting is determined.  Such proposals must also comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC if such proposals are to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy.
Similarly, since the Company did not hold an annual meeting in fiscal year 2018, stockholder proposals will be considered untimely pursuant to Rule 14a-5(e)(2) of the U.S. Exchange Act if not received a reasonable time before the Company mails its proxy materials for the 2019 annual meeting. The Company anticipates filing a Form 8-K or disclosing in its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q the deadline for shareholder proposals once the date of the 2019 annual meeting is determined.
How can I obtain a copy of the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K?
Timberline's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including amendments thereto and financial statements, is available on the internet with this Proxy Statement at www.timberlineresources.co/meetings/. The Form is also available through the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.
At the written request of any Stockholder who owns Timberline Shares on the record date, Timberline will provide to such Stockholder, without charge, a paper copy of Timberline's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC, including the financial statements, but not including exhibits.
If requested, Timberline will provide copies of the exhibits for a reasonable fee.
Requests for additional paper copies of the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be mailed to: Timberline Resources Corporation

What materials accompany or are attached to this Proxy Statement?
The following materials accompany or are attached to this Proxy Statement:
APPENDIX A Form of Proxy Card  APPENDIX B 2018 Incentive Plan SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND   RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
The following tables set forth information as of October 5, 2018, regarding the ownership of our common stock by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· each named executive officer, each director and all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and  
· each person who is known by us to own more than 5% of our shares of common stock  
[END TABLE]
Subsequent to September 30, 2014 our board of directors and stockholders approved a one-for-twelve reverse stock split of our common stock.  After the reverse stock split, effective October 31, 2014, each holder of record held one share of common stock for every 12 shares held immediately prior to the effective date.  As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants and the related exercise prices were adjusted to reflect the change in the share price and outstanding shares on the date of the reverse stock split.  The effect of fractional shares was not material.  All share and per-share amounts and related disclosures have been retroactively adjusted for all periods to reflect the one-for-twelve reverse stock split.
The number of shares beneficially owned and the percentage of shares beneficially owned are based on 53,527,819 shares of common stock outstanding as of October 5, 2018. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Shares subject to options that are exercisable within 60 days following October 5, 2018 are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the optionee for the purpose of computing share and percentage ownership of that optionee but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table, and as affected by applicable community property laws, all persons listed have sole voting and investment power for all shares shown as beneficially owned by them.

It is believed by us that all persons named have full voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated, unless otherwise noted in the table and the footnotes thereto. Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if he or she, directly or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security.
Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock.
We are not, to the best of our knowledge, directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or foreign government.
Change in Control
The Company is not aware of any arrangement that might result in a change in control in the future. The Company has no knowledge of any arrangements, including any pledge by any person of our securities, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in the Company's control.

The Audit Committee has adopted procedures requiring the Audit Committee to review and approve in advance, all particular engagements for services provided by the Company's independent auditor. Consistent with applicable laws, the procedures permit limited amounts of services, other than audit, review or attest services, to be approved by one or more members of the Audit Committee pursuant to authority delegated by the Audit Committee, provided the Audit Committee is informed of each particular service. All of the engagements and fees for 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews with DeCoria, Maichel & Teague P.S. whether the non-audit services to be provided are compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence.  
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. PROPOSAL 2 — APPROVAL OF THE ADOPTION OF THE 2018 INCENTIVE PLAN
What am I voting on?
Background
On October 16, 2018, the Board approved the 2018 Incentive Plan, subject to our Stockholders approval at the Meeting.  The purpose of the 2018 Incentive Plan is to promote our interests and our Stockholders interests by aiding us in attracting and retaining employees, officers, consultants, advisors and non-employee directors capable of assuring the future success of our Company, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of our business and to compensate such persons through various stock-based arrangements and provide them with opportunities for stock ownership in our Company, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with our Stockholders.
If approved, the 2018 Incentive Plan is intended to replace our 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan.  As of October 5, 2018, there were 3,280,000 Timberline Shares issuable under issued and outstanding options under our Amended 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan and 125,000 Timberline Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to future grants of Awards under the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan. If the 2018 Incentive Plan is approved by the Stockholders, the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan will be withdrawn for the purposes of issuing new options or equity incentives, and therefore, no further options or equity incentives will be granted under our 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan after adoption and approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan.
The Board believes that the following factors should be considered in connection with the adoption of the 2018 Incentive Plan:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Equity compensation remains a key component of a competitive compensation package of our industry and we believe it effectively rewards employees for the success of our Company over time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan contained multiple provisions which were not in compliance with the rules and regulations of the TSX Venture Exchange since the Company voluntarily de-listed from the NYSE American Exchange, and the TSX Venture Exchange required a number of the changes between the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan and the 2018 Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan will no longer be utilized by the Company and new stock options and equity incentives would no longer be granted under its terms.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The 2018 Incentive Plan would enable us in addition to granting stock options, the flexibility to grant other forms of equity incentives, such as restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Compensation Committee is designated as the body responsible for the administration of the 2018 Incentive Plan and generally has broad authority  to determine the recipients of awards and the terms and conditions of such awards.
· The Compensation Committee is designated as the body responsible for the administration of the 2018 Incentive Plan and generally has broad authority  to determine the recipients of awards and the terms and conditions of such awards.
· Approval of 8,000,000 Timberline Shares issuable under the 2018 Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Approval of the 2018 Incentive Plan by the Stockholders is subject to any additional changes required by applicable stock exchange policies or securities laws as may be required after such approval.
Participation and Current Reservation of Options and Equity Awards
The 2018 Incentive Plan will be available to our directors, executive officers employees and natural person consultants on the same basis of participation – the discretion of our Compensation Committee in determining the grant of options and equity awards (collectively, "Awards") under the plan on the basis of their judgment as to the best interests of the Company and the Stockholders.
There are currently no Awards reserved or otherwise set aside to be granted under the 2018 Incentive Plan, including any Awards to be granted to any executive officer (including any named executive officer), director, nominee for director, employee or any associate of any of the foregoing.  Since Awards are to be granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and those grants have not been conducted on a consistent basis in the past, it is not possible to determine at this time the number of Awards that would likely have been granted had the 2018 Incentive  Plan been in effect during the prior fiscal year.
The following is a brief summary of the material terms of the 2018 Incentive Plan.  This summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2018 Incentive Plan which is set out in Appendix "B"
Description of the 2018 Incentive Plan
Administration
The Compensation Committee administers the 2018 Incentive Plan and has full power and authority to determine when and to whom Awards will be granted, and the type, amount and other terms and conditions of each Award, consistent with the provisions of the 2018 Incentive Plan. Subject to the provisions of the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee may amend the terms of, or accelerate the exercisability of, an outstanding Award. The Compensation Committee has authority to interpret the 2018 Incentive Plan and establish rules and regulations for the administration of the 2018 Incentive Plan.
The Compensation Committee may delegate its powers under the 2018 Incentive Plan to one or more officers, except that such delegated officers will not be permitted to grant Awards to any members of the Board or executive officers who are subject to Section 16 of the United States Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or in a manner as would cause the 2018 Incentive Plan not to comply with applicable exchange rules or applicable corporate law.
Eligibility
Any employee, officer, non-employee director, employee, consultant, independent contractor or advisor providing services to the Company or an affiliate, or any person to whom an offer of employment has been made, and who is selected by the Compensation Committee to participate, is eligible to receive an Award under the 2018 Incentive Plan. As of October 5, 2018, 10 persons were eligible as a class to be selected by the Compensation Committee to receive Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan.
Shares Available for Awards
The aggregate number of Timberline Shares that may be issued under all stock-based Awards made under the 2018 Incentive Plan will be 8,000,000 Timberline Shares.  In addition, no greater than 7,000,000 Timberline Shares may be issued pursuant to the exercise of options under the 2018 Incentive Plan. If Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan expire or otherwise terminate without being exercised, the Timberline Shares not acquired pursuant to such Awards shall again become available for issuance under the 2018 Incentive Plan. However, under the following circumstances, shares will not again be available for issuance under the 2018 Incentive Plan: (i) shares unissued due to a "net exercise" of a stock option, (ii) any shares withheld or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to a stock option or Stock Appreciation Right ("SAR"), (iii) shares covered by a SAR that is not settled in shares upon exercise and (iv) shares repurchased using stock option exercise proceeds.  In addition, Awards that do not entitle the recipient to receive or purchase shares shall not be counted against the number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Incentive Plan.
Certain Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan are subject to limitations. Non-employee directors may not be granted awards in any calendar year of more than 500,000 shares. The aggregate number of options granted to any one person (and companies wholly owned by that person) in a 12 month period must not exceed 5% of the issued shares of the Company, calculated on the date an option is granted to the person (unless the Company has obtained requisite disinterested Stockholder approval). The aggregate number of options granted to any one consultant in a 12-month period must not exceed 2% of the issued shares of the Company, calculated at the date an option is granted to the consultant. The aggregate number of options granted to all persons retained to provide investor relations activities must not exceed 2% of the issued shares of the Company in any 12-month period, calculated at the date an option is granted to any such person.
The Compensation Committee will adjust (i) the number of shares available under the 2018 Incentive Plan, (ii) the number and type of shares subject to outstanding Awards and (iii) the share limits described above in the case of a dividend (other than a regular cash dividend), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization,  merger, consolidation, split-off, repurchase or exchange of shares, or other similar corporate transaction where such an adjustment is necessary to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits available under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Any adjustment determination made by the Compensation Committee or the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive.  
Dilution Discussion
In setting the amount of shares authorized under the 2018 Incentive Plan for which Stockholder approval is being sought, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered, among other factors, the historical amounts of equity awards granted by the Company, and the potential future grants over the next several years. The Committee and the Board also consider recommendations by the CEO for the other named executive officers. Neither the Committee nor the Board has authorized specific grants of awards to be made under the 2018 Incentive Plan, subject to Stockholder approval. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the shares being requested should be sufficient for Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan for approximately the next three years.
To reduce the dilutive impact of our equity award grants on our Stockholders' interests, we actively administer our equity grant program to make use of our resources as effective as possible.  Equity awards are generally limited to (1) those positions deemed critical to our future success, (2) individuals whose personal performance makes them highly valuable to us, and (3) essential new hires.
Type of Awards and Terms and Conditions
The 2018 Incentive Plan provides that the Compensation Committee may grant awards to eligible participants in any of the following forms, subject to such terms, conditions and provisions as the Compensation Committee may determine to be necessary or desirable:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· stock options, including both incentive stock options ("ISOs") and non-qualified stock options (together with ISOs, "options");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· SAR's;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· restricted stock;

[BEGIN TABLE]
· performance awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· dividend equivalents; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· other stock-based awards.  
[END TABLE]
Options and SARs
The holder of an option is entitled to purchase a number of shares of our common stock at a specified exercise price during a specified time period, all as determined by the Compensation Committee. The holder of a SAR is entitled to receive the excess of the fair market value (calculated as of the exercise date) of a specified number of shares of our common stock over the grant price of the SAR.
Exercise Price. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the exercise price and other terms of options and SARs, except that the exercise price will in no event be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of our common stock underlying the Award on the date of grant, unless such option or SAR is granted in substitution for an option or SAR previously granted by a merged or acquired entity. Without the approval of stockholders, we will not amend or replace previously granted options or SARs in a transaction that constitutes a "repricing" as discussed in the 2018 Incentive Plan. Vesting. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine when and under what circumstances an option or SAR will vest.
Exercise. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the method or methods by which an option or SAR may be exercised, which methods may include a net exercise. The Compensation Committee is not authorized under the 2018 Incentive Plan to accept a promissory note as consideration.
Expiration. Options and SARs will expire at such time as the Compensation Committee determines; provided, however, that no option or SAR may be exercised more than ten years from the date of grant, except that, in the case of an ISO held by a 10% stockholder, the option may not be exercised more than five years from the date of grant.
Special Limitations on ISOs. In the case of a grant of an option intended to qualify as an ISO, no such option may be granted to a participant who owns, at the time of the grant, stock representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or our subsidiaries unless the exercise price per share of our common stock subject to such ISO is at least 110% of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant, and such ISO award is not exercisable more than five years after its date of grant. In addition, options designated as ISOs shall not be eligible for treatment under the Internal Revenue Code as ISOs to the extent that either: (i) the aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000 or (ii) such ISOs otherwise remain exercisable but are not exercised within three months after termination of employment (or such other period of time provided in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code).
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The holder of restricted stock will own shares of our common stock subject to restrictions imposed by the Compensation Committee for a specified time period determined by the Compensation Committee. The holder of restricted stock units will have the right, subject to restrictions imposed by the Compensation Committee, to receive shares of our common stock at some future date determined by the Compensation Committee. The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of restricted stock and restricted stock units will occur at such times and in such installments as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have the right to make the timing of the grant and/or the issuance, ability to retain, vesting and/or settlement of restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to continued employment, passage of time and/or such performance conditions as are deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee.  Unless otherwise specified by the Compensation Committee, upon a participant ceasing to provide service as an employee or a non-employee director, all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units shall be forfeited and reacquired by us.
Dividend Equivalents
The holder of a dividend equivalent will be entitled to receive payments (in cash, shares of our common stock, other securities or other property) equivalent to the amount of cash dividends paid by us to our stockholders, with respect to the number of shares determined by the Compensation Committee. Dividend equivalents will be subject to other terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee, but the Compensation Committee may not (i) grant dividend equivalents in connection with options or SARs or (ii) pay a dividend equivalent with respect to an award prior to the date on which all performance-based conditions or restrictions on such award have been satisfied, waived or lapsed.
Performance Awards
The Compensation Committee may grant performance awards denominated or payable in cash, shares (including restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards),  other securities, other awards or other property under the 2018 Incentive Plan. A performance award will be conditioned upon the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. Other Stock-Based Awards
The Compensation Committee is also authorized to grant other types of Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to shares of our common stock, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee and the limitations in the 2018 Incentive Plan. No other stock-based awards shall contain a purchase right or option-like exercise feature.
Duration, Termination and Amendment
The 2018 Incentive Plan has a term of ten years expiring on● , unless terminated earlier by the Board. The Board may at any time and from time to time and in any respect amend or modify the 2018 Incentive Plan. The Board shall require the approval of any amendment or modification of the 2018 Incentive Plan that would:  (i) be required under the listing requirements of the TSX Venture Exchange or another exchange or securities market on which our shares are then listed for trading, (ii) increase the number of shares authorized under the 2018 Incentive Plan, (iii) increase the annual participant share limits or annual cash award limits, (iv) permit a repricing of options or SARs, (v) permit the award of options or SARs with an exercise price less than 100% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, or (vi) increase the maximum term of options or SARs. No amendment or modification of the 2018 Incentive Plan may be made that would adversely affect any outstanding award without the consent of the participant or the current holder of the award.
Effect of Corporate Transaction
Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan are generally subject to special provisions upon the occurrence of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, plan of arrangement, take-over bid or tender offer, repurchase or exchange of Shares, or any other similar corporate transaction with respect to us. In the event of such a corporate transaction, the Compensation Committee or the Board may provide for one or more of the following to occur upon the occurrence of the event (or immediately prior to such event, provided the event is consummated):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· termination of any Award, whether vested or not, in exchange for an amount of cash and/or other property equal to the amount that would have been received upon exercise of the Award or the realization of the participant's rights under the Award. Awards may be terminated without payment if the Compensation Committee or Board determines that no amount is realizable under the Award as of the time of the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· replacement of any Award with other rights or property selected by the Compensation Committee or the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the assumption of any Award by the successor entity (or its parent or subsidiary) or the arrangement for the substitution for similar Awards covering the stock of such successor entity;

Clawback or Recoupment
All Awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan will be subject to forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to any clawback policy we may adopt or amend from time to time, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Income Tax Withholding
In order to comply with all applicable income tax laws and regulations, we may take appropriate action to ensure that all applicable taxes, which are the sole responsibility of the participant, are withheld or collected.  The  Compensation Committee may allow the participant to satisfy any tax obligation by (a) electing to have a portion of the shares withheld that otherwise would be delivered upon exercise, receipt or the lapse of restrictions with respect to the award, or (b) electing to deliver to us shares of the Company other than shares received pursuant to the award with a fair market value equal to the amount of the tax obligation.  Any election, if allowed, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
Limited Transferability of Awards
Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, no Award or other right or interest of a participant under the 2018 Incentive Plan (other than fully vested and unrestricted shares issued pursuant to an Award) shall be transferable by a participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and no right or Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance shall be void and unenforceable. If a transfer is allowed by the Compensation Committee (other than for fully vested and unrestricted shares), the transfer will be for no value and shall comply with the Form S-8 rules. The Compensation Committee may establish procedures to allow a named beneficiary to exercise the rights of the participant and receive any property distributable with respect to any Award upon the participant's death.  If a provision is included that a participant's heirs or administrators can exercise any portion of an outstanding option, the period in which they can do so must not exceed one year from the participant's death.  Any options granted to any participant who is a director, employee, consultant or management company employee must expire within a reasonable period following the date the participant ceases to be in that role, which period may not exceed 12 months.
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES APPLICABLE TO THE 2018 INCENTIVE PLAN
The following is a summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan
Grant of Options and SARs.  The grant of a stock option (either an incentive stock option or a non-qualified stock option) or SAR is not expected to result in any taxable income for the recipient.
Exercise of Incentive Stock Options.  Upon the exercise of an incentive stock option, no taxable income is realized by the optionee for purposes of regular federal income tax.  However, the optionee may be required to recognize income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax ("AMT").  If stock is issued to the optionee pursuant to the exercise of an incentive stock option, and if no disqualifying disposition of such shares is made by such optionee within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the transfer of such shares to such optionee, then (1) upon the sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price will be taxed to such optionee as a long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss, and (2) the Company will not be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes.
If the stock acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option is disposed of prior to the expiration of either holding period described above, generally (1) the optionee will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of such shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the disposition of such shares) over the option price paid for such shares, and (2) the Company will be entitled to deduct such amount for federal income tax purposes if the amount represents an ordinary and necessary business expense.  Any further gain (or loss) realized by the optionee will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss), as the case may be, and will not result in any deduction by the Company.
Exercise of Non-Qualified Stock Options and SARs.  Upon exercising a non-qualified stock option, the optionee must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of common stock acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price, and the Company generally will be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the same amount.  Upon exercising a SAR, the amount of any cash received and the fair market value on the exercise date of any shares of common stock received are taxable to the recipient as ordinary income and generally are deductible by the Company. The tax consequence upon a disposition of shares acquired through the exercise of a non-qualified stock option or SAR will depend on how long the shares have been held.  Generally, there will be no tax consequence to the Company in connection with the disposition of shares acquired under a non-qualified stock option or SAR.
Restricted Stock.  Recipients of grants of restricted stock generally will be required to include as taxable ordinary income the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time it is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  However, an award holder who makes an 83(b) election within 30 days of the date of grant of the restricted stock will incur taxable ordinary income on the date of grant equal to the fair market value of such shares of restricted stock (determined without regard to forfeiture restrictions).  With respect to the sale of shares after the forfeiture restrictions have expired, the holding period to determine whether the award recipient has long-term or short-term capital gain or loss generally begins when the restrictions expire, and the tax basis for such shares will generally be based on the fair market value of the shares on that date.  However, if the award holder made an 83(b) election as described above, the holding period commences on the date of such election, and the tax basis will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the election (determined without regard to the forfeiture restrictions on the shares).  Dividends, if any, that are paid or accrued while the restricted stock is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture will also be taxed as ordinary income.  The Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to amounts the award holder includes in ordinary income at the time of such income inclusion.
Restricted Stock Units, Performance Awards and Dividend Equivalents.  Recipients of grants of restricted stock units, performance awards or dividend equivalents (collectively, "deferred awards") will not incur any federal income tax liability at the time the deferred awards are granted.  Deferred award holders will recognize ordinary income equal to (a) the amount of cash received under the terms of the deferred award or, as applicable, (b) the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the date of receipt) under the terms of the deferred award.  Dividend equivalents received with respect to any deferred award will also be taxed as ordinary income.  Cash or shares to be received pursuant to a deferred award generally become payable when applicable forfeiture restrictions lapse; provided, however, that, if the terms of the deferred award so provide, payment may be delayed until a later date to the extent permitted under applicable tax laws.  The Company will be entitled to an income tax deduction for any amounts included by the deferred award holder as ordinary income.  For deferred awards that are payable in shares, the participant's tax basis in the shares received pursuant thereto will be equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time the shares become payable.  Upon the sale of the shares, appreciation (or depreciation) after the shares are paid is treated as either short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss) depending on how long the shares have been held.
Income Tax Deduction.  Subject to the usual rules concerning reasonable compensation, including our obligation to withhold or otherwise collect certain income and payroll taxes, our Company generally will be entitled to a corresponding income tax deduction at the time a participant recognizes ordinary income from awards made under the 2018 Incentive Plan.   However, Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits to $1,000,000 the amount that a publicly-held corporation is allowed each year to deduct for the compensation paid to each of the corporation's chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and the corporation's other three most highly compensated executive officers.
Delivery of Shares for Tax Obligation.  Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Committee may permit participants receiving or exercising awards, subject to the discretion of the Committee and upon such terms and conditions as it may impose, to deliver shares of common stock (either shares received upon the receipt or exercise of the award or shares previously owned by the participant) to the Company to satisfy federal and state tax obligations.
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  The Committee will administer and interpret the 2018 Incentive Plan and all award agreements in a manner consistent with the intent to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code to avoid any adverse tax results thereunder to a holder of an award.  If any provision of the 2018 Incentive Plan or any award agreement would result in such adverse consequences, the Committee may amend that provision or take other necessary action to avoid any adverse tax results, and no such action will be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any holder of an award under the 2018 Incentive Plan.
Special Rules for Executive Officers and Directors Subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  Special rules may apply to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In particular, shares received through exercise or payout of a non-qualified option, an incentive stock option (for purposes of the AMT only), an SAR or a restricted stock unit, and any shares of restricted stock that vest, may be treated as restricted property for purposes of Section  83 of the Internal Revenue Code if the recipient has had a non-exempt acquisition of shares of Company stock within the six months prior to the exercise, payout or vesting. Accordingly, the amount of any ordinary income recognized and the amount of the Company's income tax deduction will be determined as of the end of that period unless a special election is made by the recipient pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to recognize income as of the date the shares are received.

OTHER STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
In February 2005, our Board adopted the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, which was approved by a vote of shareholders at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on September 23, 2005. This plan authorized the granting of up to 62,500 non-qualified stock options to our officers, directors, and consultants.
On August 31, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Timberline Resources Corporation 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Amended 2005 Plan") for the purposes of increasing the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the original 2005 plan from 62,500 shares to 229,167 shares and allowing "Ten Percent Shareholders" (as defined in the Amended 2005 Plan) to participate in the plan on the same basis of any other participant. The Amended 2005 Plan was approved by a vote of shareholders at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on September 22, 2006.
On August 22, 2008, our shareholders approved a proposal for the increase in the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the original 2005 plan as previously amended. Following the increase, the plan provided for 583,334 shares of common stock for awards under the plan.
On May 28, 2010, our shareholders approved a proposal for the increase in the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the original 2005 plan as previously amended. Following the increase, the plan provides for 833,334 shares of common stock for awards under the plan.  
All share amounts included in this section have been revised to reflect a one-for-twelve reverse stock split that was approved by our stockholders and implemented on October 31, 2014.
On August 24, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan, subject to our Stockholders' approval. The purpose of the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan is to promote our interests and our Stockholders' interests by aiding us in attracting and retaining employees, officers, consultants, advisors and nonemployee directors capable of ensuring the future success of our Company. On September 24, 2015, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Company's 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan in which the Company's executive officers and directors are participants. This plan replaced our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended. The aggregate number of shares that may be issued under all stock-based awards made under the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan is 4 million shares of our common stock.  If the 2018 Incentive Plan is adopted, the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan will be retired and no further options or awards will be issued under the 2015 Stock and Incentive Plan.

On October 31, 2014 we completed a one-for-twelve reverse stock split, and proportional adjustments were made to the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, and prices of our outstanding options.
As to the options granted to date, there were no options exercised during the year ended September 30, 2018.  PROPOSAL 3 — AGEI  SECURITIES PURCHASE PROPOSAL
The Company and AGEI have been discussing a possible securities purchase transaction on a private placement basis whereby AGEI would purchase from the Company (the "AGEI Securities Purchase") approximately US$500,000 worth of units of the Company ("Units"), with each Unit consisting of one Timberline Share and one common stock purchase warrant of the Company (a "Warrant"), with each warrant exercisable for a period of three years from the closing date of the AGEI Securities Purchase to acquire one Timberline Share.
The pricing of the Units will be determined through arms-length negotiations between the Company and AGEI taking into account the market price of the Timberline Shares at the time of pricing, the restricted nature of the securities and other factors deemed relevant by the parties. The Company anticipates that the AGEI Securities Purchase, if approved by the Stockholders, will close in or around February 2019.
TSX Venture Exchange requires Stockholder approval of a transaction that results in the creation of a new "Control Person," which means any person who holds or is one of a combination of persons who hold a sufficient number of any of the securities of an issuer so as to affect materially the control of that issuer, or who holds more than 20% of the outstanding voting shares of an issuer except where there is evidence showing that the holder of those securities does not materially affect the control of the issuer
As of the date of this Proxy, AGEI holds 10,000,000 Timberline Shares, representing 18.7% of the Company's issued and outstanding voting shares based on 53,527,819 shares outstanding as of October 5, 2018.  See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters" above for further information on the securities of the Company beneficially owned by AGEI.  Donald McDowell, a director of the Company, is the principal shareholder of AGEI, owning approximately 75% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of AGEI.
The following table sets forth the resulting percentage ownership of the Company by AGEI based on a range of pricing of the Units and assuming exercise of the common stock purchase warrants of the Company, including the Warrants, held or to be held by AGEI following the purchase of US$500,000 of Units of the Company.

 US$0.10   5,000,000   15,000,000   25.63%   36.48%  
 US$0.15   3,333,333   13,333,333   23.45%   33.23%  
 (1)   Based on 53,527,819 Timberline Shares issued and outstanding on October 5, 2018 and assuming additional Timberline Shares are issued by the Company upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants.  
 (2)   Assumes the exercise of 5,000,000 common stock purchase warrants of the Company currently held by AGEI and the exercise of Warrants acquired pursuant to the purchase of Units.  
[END TABLE]
If this proposal is approved by the Stockholders the Company will proceed with the AGEI Securities Purchase on the basis of terms to be negotiated by the Board (with Donald McDowell recusing himself) in the context of the market at the time of the pricing and, assuming closing of the AGEI Securities Purchase, AGEI will become a "control person" of the Company pursuant to the rules of the TSX Venture Exchange owning more than 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding voting shares.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE AGEI SECURITIES PURCHASE PROPOSAL.   PROPOSAL 4 — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO   EFFECT NAME CHANGE
On October 16, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously adopted a resolution setting forth a proposed amendment to Article I of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, subject to Stockholder approval, to change the name of the Company from "Timberline Resources Corporation" to a name to be selected by the Board of Directors of the Company.  The Board of Directors has determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its Stockholders to seek approval for this name change, including the corresponding amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation.
The Company's current corporate name as reflected in the Certificate of Incorporation is "Timberline Resources Corporation" and is consistent with the Company's original plan to focus a purchasing timber lands and selling the timber to generate cash to fund exploration for gold and potentially other non-mineral resources. The Company's focus has become exploration for gold and copper mineral resources located within Nevada.  The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its Stockholders to change the name of the Company to better reflect its business purpose.  At this time, the Board has not determined a specific name that would be more reflective of the Company's proposed future business pursuits.  Accordingly, the Board is seeking the authorization of the Stockholders to determine whether to change the name of the Company, to select a new name in the future and subsequently file an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect such name change without further approval of the Stockholders.
By voting FOR this proposal you are authorizing the Board to determine whether to change the name of the Company, to select a new name of the Company, if the determination is made to change the name, and to file a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to effect such name change without further approval by the Stockholders.
You will not receive another opportunity to vote on the Name Change following this authorization and approval to grant discretion to the Board.
The Board will determine whether to change the name of the Company and file a Certificate of Amendment to make such name change within six months of the grant of approval from the Stockholders hereunder.  Thereafter, the authorization of the Stockholders granted pursuant to this proposal shall expire.  The Board may abandon the name change in its discretion at any time following approval by the Stockholders but prior to the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation shall only have the substantive effect of changing the name of the Company in all places where such name appears in the Certificate of Incorporation.  No change will be made to the other provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation on the basis of this proposal.
If the proposal to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to change its name is approved by the Stockholders at the Meeting, a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the name change as soon as practicable after the Board has determined to proceed with the name change, subject to receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals.
Certificates representing Timberline Shares would not be required to be re-issued under the new corporate name and will not be re-issued under the new corporate name unless submitted by the holder thereof to the Company's transfer agent for such purpose. Certificates issued in the name of "Timberline Resources Corporation" will continue to represent the same number of shares of common stock in the newly named corporation without any further action required by the holder of such Timberline Shares.
Approval of the Name Change requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock.  If a Stockholder abstains from voting or directs the Stockholder's proxy to abstain from voting, such shares are considered present at the Meeting for purposes a quorum, but, because they are not affirmative votes for the proposal, they will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE NAME CHANGE. OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, management does not know of any other matter that will come before the meeting.
The regulations regarding the delivery of copies of proxy materials to Stockholders permit the Company and brokerage firms to send one Proxy Statement to multiple Stockholders who share the same address under certain circumstances.

Subject to the terms of the Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities (but excluding promissory notes), other Awards or other property or any combination thereof), and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 (iv)   Limits on Transfer of Awards.  Except as otherwise provided by the Committee in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it determines, no Award (other than fully vested and unrestricted Shares issued pursuant to any Award) and no right under any such Award shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and no Award (other than fully vested and unrestricted Shares issued pursuant to any Award) or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.  Where the Committee does permit the transfer of an Award other than a fully vested and unrestricted Share, such permitted transfer shall be for no value and in accordance with the rules of Form S-8.  The Committee may also establish procedures as it deems appropriate for a Participant to designate a person or persons, as beneficiary or beneficiaries, to exercise the rights of the Participant and receive any property distributable with respect to any Award in the event of the Participant's death.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (v)   Restrictions; Securities Exchange Listing.  All Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, applicable federal or state securities laws and regulatory requirements, and the Committee may cause appropriate entries to be made with respect to, or legends to be placed on the certificates for, such Shares or other securities to reflect such restrictions.  The Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares or other securities covered by an Award unless and until the requirements of any federal or state securities or other laws, rules or regulations (including the rules of any securities exchange) as may be determined by the Company to be applicable are satisfied.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (vi)   Prohibition on Option and Stock Appreciation Right Repricing. Except as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, the Committee may not, without prior approval of the Company's stockholders, seek to effect any re-pricing of any previously granted, "underwater" Option or Stock Appreciation Right by:  (i) amending or modifying the terms of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to lower the exercise price; (ii) canceling the underwater Option or Stock Appreciation Right and granting either (A) replacement Options or Stock Appreciation Rights having a lower exercise price; or (B) Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Award or Other Stock-Based Award in exchange; or (iii) cancelling or repurchasing the underwater Option or Stock Appreciation Right for cash or other securities.  An Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     deemed to be "underwater" at any time when the Fair Market Value of the Shares covered by such Award is less than the exercise price of the Award.  Disinterested Shareholder approval will be obtained for any reduction in the exercise price if the Optionee is an Insider of the Company at the time of the proposed amendment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (vii)   Section 409A Provisions.  Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that constitutes "deferred compensation" to a Participant under Section 409A and applicable guidance thereunder is otherwise payable or distributable to a Participant under the Plan or any Award Agreement solely by reason of the occurrence of a change in control or due to the Participant's disability or "separation from service" (as such term is defined under Section 409A), such amount or benefit will not be payable or distributable to the Participant by reason of such circumstance unless the Committee determines in good faith that (i) the circumstances giving rise to such change in control event, disability or separation from service meet the definition of a change in control event, disability, or separation from service, as the case may be, in Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code and applicable proposed or final regulations, or (ii) the payment or distribution of such amount or benefit would be exempt from the application of Section 409A by reason of the short‑term deferral exemption or otherwise.  Any payment or distribution that otherwise would be made to a Participant who is a Specified Employee (as determined by the Committee in good faith) on account of separation from service may not be made before the date which is six months after the date of the Specified Employee's separation from service (or if earlier, upon the Specified Employee's death) unless the payment or distribution is exempt from the application of Section 409A by reason of the short‑term deferral exemption or otherwise.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (viii)   Acceleration of Vesting or Exercisability.  No Award Agreement shall accelerate the exercisability of any Award or the lapse of restrictions relating to any Award in connection with a change-in-control event unless such acceleration occurs upon the consummation of (or effective immediately prior to the consummation of, provided that the consummation subsequently occurs) such change-in-control event.  
[END TABLE]
Section 7. Amendment and Termination; Corrections
(a) Amendments to the Plan and Awards.  The Board may from time to time amend, suspend or terminate this Plan, and the Committee may amend the terms of any previously granted Award, provided that no amendment to the terms of any previously granted Award may, (except as expressly provided in the Plan) materially and adversely alter or impair the terms or conditions of the Award previously granted to a Participant under this Plan without the written consent of the Participant or holder thereof.  Any amendment to this Plan, or to the terms of any Award previously granted, is subject to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations  and policies of any applicable governmental entity or securities exchange, including receipt of any required approval from the governmental entity or stock exchange.  For greater certainty and without limiting the foregoing, the Board may amend, suspend, terminate or discontinue the Plan, and the Committee may amend or alter any previously granted Award, as applicable, without obtaining the approval of stockholders of the Company in order to:

 (ii)   amend any terms relating to the granting or exercise of Awards, including but not limited to terms relating to the amount and payment of the exercise price, or the vesting, expiry, assignment or adjustment of Awards, or otherwise waive any conditions of or rights of the Company under any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (iii)   make changes that are necessary or desirable to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of any applicable governmental entity or stock exchange (including amendments to Awards necessary or desirable to avoid any adverse tax results under Section 409A, and no action taken to comply with Section 409A shall be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely alter or impair the rights of any holder of an Award or beneficiary thereof); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (iv)   amend any terms relating to the administration of the Plan, including the terms of any administrative guidelines or other rules related to the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
For greater certainty, prior approval of the stockholders of the Company shall be required for any amendment to the Plan or an Award that would:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

In the event of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, split‑up, spin‑off, combination, plan of arrangement, take-over bid or tender offer, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company or any other similar corporate transaction or event involving the Company (or the Company shall enter into a written agreement to undergo such a transaction or event), the Committee or the Board may, in its sole discretion, provide for any of the following to be effective upon the consummation of the event (or effective immediately prior to the consummation of the event, provided that the consummation of the event subsequently occurs), and no action taken under this Section 7(b) shall be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely alter the rights of any holder of an Award or beneficiary thereof:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (i)   either (A) termination of the Award, whether or not vested, in exchange for an amount of cash and/or other property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of the Award or realization of the Participant's rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if, as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described in this Section 7(b)(i)(A), the Committee or the Board determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of the Award or realization of the Participant's rights, then the Award may be terminated by the Company without any payment) or (B) the replacement of the Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee or the Board, in its sole discretion;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (ii)   that the Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]

The Committee may, without prior approval of the stockholders of the Company,  correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan. Section 8. Income Tax Withholding
In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant, are withheld or collected from such Participant.  In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax obligation by (a) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes (subject to any limitations required by ASC Topic 718 to avoid adverse accounting treatment) or (b) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes.  The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
Section 9. General Provisions
(a) No Rights to Awards.  No Eligible Person, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan.  The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
(b) Award Agreements.  No Participant shall have rights under an Award granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been signed by the Participant (if requested by the Company), or until such Award Agreement is delivered and accepted through an electronic medium in accordance with procedures established by the Company.  An Award Agreement need not be signed by a representative of the Company unless required by the Committee.  Each Award Agreement shall be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and any other terms and conditions (not inconsistent with the Plan) determined by the Committee.
(c) Plan Provisions Control.  In the event that any provision of an Award Agreement conflicts with or is inconsistent in any respect with the terms of the Plan as set forth herein or subsequently amended, the terms of the Plan shall control.
(d) No Rights of Stockholders.  Except with respect to Shares issued under Awards (and subject to such conditions as the Committee may impose on such Awards pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) or Section 6(e)), neither a Participant nor the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until such Shares have been issued. (e) No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation plans or arrangements, and such plans or arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
(f) No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause, in accordance with applicable law.  In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.  Nothing in this Plan shall confer on any person any legal or equitable right against the Company or any Affiliate, directly or indirectly, or give rise to any cause of action at law or in equity against the Company or an Affiliate.  Under no circumstances shall any person ceasing to be an employee of the Company or any Affiliate be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit under the Plan which such employee might otherwise have enjoyed but for termination of employment, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful or unfair dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise.  By participating in the Plan, each Participant shall be deemed to have accepted all the conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee and shall be fully bound thereby.
(g) Governing Law.  The internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Idaho shall govern all questions concerning the validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award.
(h) Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
(i) No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person.  To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
(j) Other Benefits.  No compensation or benefit awarded to or realized by any Participant under the Plan shall be included for the purpose of computing such Participant's compensation or benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, disability, severance, termination pay, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company, unless required by law or otherwise provided by such other plan. (k) No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Share or whether such fractional Share or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
(l) Headings.  Headings are given to the sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Section 10. Clawback or Recoupment
All Awards under this Plan shall be subject to forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to any Company clawback policy, as may be adopted or amended from time to time, and such forfeiture and/or penalty conditions or provisions as determined by the Committee.
Section 11. Effective Date of the Plan
The Plan was adopted by the Board on [DATE], 2018.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company to be held on [DATE], 2018, and the Plan shall be effective as of the date of such shareholder approval.  On and after stockholder approval of the Plan, no awards shall be granted under the Prior Stock Plan, but all outstanding awards previously granted under the Prior Stock Plan shall remain outstanding and subject to the terms of the Prior Plan.
Section 12. Term of the Plan
No Award shall be granted under the Plan, and the Plan shall terminate, on [DATE], 2028 or any earlier date of discontinuation or termination established pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such dates, and the authority of the Committee provided for hereunder with respect to the Plan and any Awards, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond the termination of the Plan.
