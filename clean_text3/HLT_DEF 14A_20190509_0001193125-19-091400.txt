YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND 
CERTAIN GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Our Board manages or directs our business and affairs, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its business through meetings of the Board and three standing committees: the Audit Committee; the Compensation Committee; and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Board has a majority of independent directors, and all of our Board's committees are fully independent. 
We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. Notable features of our corporate governance include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a single class of voting stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual election of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a majority voting standard for directors in uncontested elections;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a lead independent director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a "proxy access" by-law;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· regular executive sessions of independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· regular Board and committee evaluations led by our lead independent director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· no stockholder rights plan; and if our Board were ever to adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future without prior  stockholder approval, we would either submit the plan to stockholders for ratification or cause the rights plan to expire within one year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a range of other corporate governance best practices, including limits on the number of directorships held by our directors  to prevent "overboarding," stock ownership guidelines for our executives and directors, a robust director education program, rotation of committee members, a commitment to Board refreshment and diversity, and an extensive director nominee  selection process.  
[END TABLE]
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE AND INDEPENDENCE DETERMINATIONS 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and NYSE rules, a director is not independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that he or she does not have a direct or indirect material relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, the director must meet the bright-line tests for independence set forth by the NYSE rules. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines define independence in accordance with the independence definition in the current NYSE corporate governance rules for listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to review the independence of all directors at least annually. 
In the event a director has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the objective tests set forth in the NYSE independence definition, the Board will determine, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, whether that relationship is material. 
Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Begley, Ms. Healey, Mr. Mabus, Ms. McHale, Mr. Schreiber, Ms. Smith and Mr. Steenland is independent under the guidelines for director independence set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and under all applicable NYSE guidelines, including with respect to committee membership. Our Board also has determined that each of Ms. Begley, Mr. Mabus, and Mr. Steenland is "independent" for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
In making its independence determinations, the Board considered and reviewed all information known to it (including information identified through annual directors' questionnaires). 
BOARD STRUCTURE 
Our Board of Directors is led by Mr. Steenland, our lead independent director, and Mr. Gray, our Non-Executive Chairman. The Chief Executive Officer position is separate from the Chairman position. Although we believe that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions is appropriate corporate governance for us at this time, our Board believes that the Company and stockholders are best served by maintaining flexibility to determine whether and when the Chairperson and CEO positions should be separate or combined to provide the appropriate leadership. Responsibilities of our lead independent director include serving as a liaison between the Chief Executive Officer and independent and non-management directors, advising as to the scope and production of Board materials, managing our Board's self-evaluation process, providing input on meeting agendas, chairing executive sessions of independent directors, monitoring communications between stockholders and our board, and consulting on corporate governance matters. Our Board appointed a new Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair in November 2017 and new Audit and Compensation Committee chairs in 2018 as part of a practice to refresh committee leadership from time to time.

OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight, including, as part of regular Board and committee meetings, general oversight of executives' management of risks relevant to the Company. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the material risks a company faces and the steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of the Board of Directors in reviewing our business strategy is an integral aspect of the Board's assessment of management's tolerance for risk and its determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. While the full Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, it is supported in this function by its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of the committees regularly reports to the Board. 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities by periodically reviewing our accounting, reporting and financial practices, including the integrity of our financial statements, the surveillance of administrative and financial controls, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and our enterprise risk management program. Through its regular meetings with management, including the finance, legal, internal audit, tax, compliance, and information technology functions, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses all significant areas of our business and summarizes for the Board all areas of risk and the appropriate mitigating factors. The Audit Committee assists the Board in monitoring cybersecurity risk by receiving quarterly reports from our information technology team that cover, among other things, our information security framework, threat assessment, response readiness, and training efforts. The Compensation Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating risks related to the Company's compensation structure and compensation programs, including the formulation, administration and regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, and coordinating, along with the Board's Chair, succession planning discussions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating programs and risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, and corporate governance. In addition, our Board receives periodic detailed operating performance reviews from management. Our chief risk officer updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and the full Board on an annual basis and as needed. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
Executive sessions, which are meetings of the non-management members of the Board, are regularly scheduled throughout the year. In addition, at least once a year, the independent directors meet in a private session that excludes management. Our lead independent director presides at these sessions. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS 
The Board and its committees conduct annual self-evaluations to assess the effectiveness of the Board and committees. The self-assessments focus on the Board's and each committee's and their respective members' performance and contribution to the Company as well as provide constructive feedback. 
COMMITTEE CHARTERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES 
Our commitment to good corporate governance is reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which describe the Board's views on a wide range of governance topics. These Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters are reviewed from time to time by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and, to the extent deemed appropriate in light of emerging practices, revised accordingly, upon recommendation to and approval by the Board. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charters and other corporate governance information are available on the Corporate Governance page of the Investors section on our website at www.ir.hilton.com. Any stockholder also may request them in print, without charge, by contacting the Office of the Corporate Secretary at Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, Virginia 22102. 
CODE OF CONDUCT 
We maintain a Code of Conduct that is applicable to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our Chair, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and other senior financial officers. The Code of Conduct sets forth our policies and expectations on a number of topics, including conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, human rights, use of our assets and business conduct and fair dealing. This Code of Conduct also satisfies the requirements for a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. We will, if required, disclose within four business days any substantive changes in or waivers of the Code of Conduct granted to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, by posting such information on our website as set forth above rather than by filing a Form 8-K. In the case of a waiver for an executive officer or a director, the required disclosure also will be made available on our website within four business days of the date of such waiver. 
The Code of Conduct may be found on our website at www.ir.hilton.com under Investors: Corporate Governance: Governance Documents: Code of Conduct. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
Our Board receives periodic updates from management on the Company's corporate responsibility strategy and initiatives. Travel with Purpose, our corporate responsibility strategy, is our commitment to drive responsible travel and tourism globally. We consistently review and build on our robust commitments to economic opportunity, environmental stewardship, and community resiliency. Our Travel with Purpose 2030 goals, announced during 2018, are to double our investment in social impact and cut our environmental footprint in half by 2030. These goals include 23 targets encompassing the Company's operations, communities and supply chain. 
We are committed to reducing our environmental footprint through energy and carbon management, water stewardship, waste reduction and responsible sourcing and to doubling our investment in social impact through creating economic opportunities, spurring local investment, respecting human rights and providing disaster relief. To those ends, we invested in various initiatives in 2018, including:

LightStay, our proprietary corporate responsibility performance measurement platform, is a global brand standard that allows us to manage the impact of our hotels on the environment and global community. LightStay helps us to measure, analyze and improve our use of natural resources, the opportunities we create, and our community service. In 2018 and for the second year in a row, Hilton was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America as an industry leader across economic, social and environmental criteria, and a Top-50 company for diversity by DiversityInc. We also were recognized as the Most JUST Company in our industry on America's Top 100 Most JUST companies by Forbes. In February 2019, Hilton was named one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies" by The Ethisphere Institute for the second year in a row. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee weighs the characteristics, experience, independence and skills of potential candidates for election to the Board and recommends nominees for director to the Board for election. In considering candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also assesses the size, composition and combined expertise of the Board. As the application of these factors involves the exercise of judgment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a standard set of fixed qualifications that is applicable to all director candidates. At a minimum, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses each candidate's strength of character, judgment, industry knowledge or experience, his or her ability to work collegially with the other members of the Board and his or her ability to satisfy any applicable legal requirements or listing standards. In addition, although the Board considers diversity of viewpoints, background and experiences, the Board does not have a formal diversity policy. In identifying prospective director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek referrals from other members of the Board, management, stockholders and other sources, including third party recommendations. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may, but need not, retain a search firm in order to assist it in identifying candidates to serve as directors of the Company The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates regardless of the source of the referral or recommendation. When considering director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks individuals with backgrounds and qualities that, when combined with those of our incumbent directors, provide a blend of skills and experience to further enhance the Board's effectiveness. 
In connection with its annual recommendation of a slate of nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may assess the contributions of those directors recommended for re-election in the context of the Board evaluation process and other perceived needs of the Board. When considering whether the directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board focused primarily on the information discussed in each board member's biographical information set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. This process resulted in the Board's nomination of the incumbent directors named in this Proxy Statement and proposed for election by you at the upcoming Annual Meeting. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates nominated by stockholders. Our by-laws allow a single stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years as of the date of nomination to nominate and include in our proxy statement director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals and 20% of the number of directors then serving, provided the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our by-laws, including that notice of a nomination be provided to our Secretary at the address below not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. A non-proxy access director nomination must notify our Secretary in writing not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Any nomination submitted to our Secretary should be in writing, satisfy the requirements contained in our by-laws, and include any necessary supporting material in support of the nomination, but must include information that would be required under the rules of the SEC to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such candidate and a written consent of the candidate to serve as one of our directors if elected. The address to submit a nomination is: Office of the Corporate Secretary, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, Virginia 22102. All nominations received by our Secretary that satisfy our by-law requirements relating to director nominations will be presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration. Stockholders also must satisfy the notification, timeliness, consent and information requirements set forth above and in our by-laws. These requirements also are described under the caption "Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting." 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD 
As described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with a member or members of the Board, including the chairperson of the Audit, Compensation, or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, or to the non-management or independent directors as a group, may do so by addressing such communications or concerns to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, Virginia 22102, who will forward such communication to the appropriate party. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
We use a combination of cash and equity-based compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our Board. Our employee and non-independent directors received no compensation for serving on the Board during 2018. 
ANNUAL COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Each independent director was entitled to annual compensation for the period from our 2018 annual meeting until our 2019 annual meeting, as shown in the table below. As part of its periodic review of the annual director compensation program, the Board approved the following changes in 2018: in addition to the regular annual cash retainer for Board members, to provide the lead independent director an additional annual cash retainer of $75,000; to increase the amount of the annual equity award for Board members by $10,000; to increase the amount of the audit and compensation committee chair retainers by $5,000; to increase the amount of the audit committee member retainer by $7,500; and to increase the amount of each of the compensation and nominating and corporate governance committee member retainers by $2,500. The Board determined, with input from its independent outside compensation consultant, to make adjustments to the annual equity award and cash retainers in order to better align the independent directors' compensation with the Company's peers and the market generally.

The equity currently held by our directors was awarded under the Hilton 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2017 Incentive Plan") and, prior to its adoption, the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2013 Incentive Plan" and, together with the 2017 Incentive Plan, the "Incentive Plans") and the material terms thereof are outlined in the table below.

In addition to the three above-referenced standing Board committees, in 2018, the Board established a special committee to review and provide oversight of specific transactions related to the investment by HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "HNA") in the Company. The members of the special committee were Ms. Begley, Ms. McHale and Mr. Steenland. Each member earned a $10,000 cash retainer plus a $500 cash payment for each meeting attended or workday spent addressing these transactions. During 2018, the special committee met four times. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY 
We have a stock ownership policy for our non-employee directors. Each of our independent directors is required to own our stock in an amount equal to five times his or her regular annual cash retainer. Each independent director, other than the directors appointed to the Board in 2017, currently satisfies the stock ownership requirement. For purposes of this requirement, a director's holdings include shares held directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, shares underlying vested options and shares held under a deferral or similar plan. Independent directors are expected to meet this ownership requirement within five years from the later of (1) December 11, 2013 and (2) the date he or she first becomes subject to the stock ownership policy.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 — APPROVAL OF EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
Our Compensation Committee and Board have unanimously approved the Hilton 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), subject to stockholder approval. The following sections summarize the material terms of the ESPP. These sections are qualified in their entirety by the full text of the ESPP, which is included as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. 
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
Purpose. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), and permits participants to be eligible to receive favorable tax treatment of shares acquired under the ESPP, as described below (such offerings, "Section 423 Offerings"). However, the Committee may also authorize offerings under the ESPP that are not intended to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. 
Effective Date. If approved by stockholders, the ESPP will become effective on May 9, 2019. The term of the ESPP will continue until terminated by the Board or the date that all shares available for issuance under the ESPP have been issued. 
Administration. The ESPP will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board unless the Board elects to administer the ESPP. For the purposes of this summary, references to the "Committee" include the Compensation Committee and the Board as well as any administrator, including Hilton management, to which the Committee has delegated any of its responsibilities and powers. The Committee may appoint one or more agents to assist in the administration of the ESPP and may delegate certain responsibilities or powers subject to ESPP terms and applicable law. Subject to the ESPP terms and applicable law, the Committee has the full and final authority to construe and interpret the ESPP and adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the ESPP as the Committee deems appropriate. The Committee may also adopt sub-plans relating to the operation and administration of the ESPP to accommodate specific requirements of local laws and procedures for non-U.S. jurisdictions that will not be required to comply with Section 423 of the Code to the extent they are inconsistent with the requirements of those regulations, the terms of which may take precedence over the terms of the ESPP. 
Shares Reserved for the ESPP. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the ESPP may not exceed 4,000,000 shares. The number of shares issuable under the ESPP and the terms of purchase rights to acquire such shares are subject to adjustment in connection with certain corporate and recapitalization events as described in the ESPP. If a purchase right expires or is terminated, surrendered or canceled without being purchased, in whole or in part, the number of shares subject to the purchase right will again be available for grant under the ESPP. 
ESPP Provisions. A participant may acquire common stock under the ESPP by authorizing payroll contributions to purchase shares of common stock. Contributions must be at a rate of between 1% and 15% (in whole percentages only) of the participant's total compensation (including base salary, wages, bonuses, commissions and other forms of incentive compensation, paid tips (other than cash tips), gratuities and service charges but excluding gifts, prizes, awards, relocation payments or similar elements of compensation). A participant may not make separate cash payments into his or her account except as required by applicable law. All contributions made by a participant will be credited (without interest) to his or her account. A participant may withdraw contributions credited to his or her account during a purchase period at any time before the applicable purchase period end date. A participant may discontinue plan participation as provided in the ESPP, but no other change may be made during a purchase period except (i) a participant may reduce the amount of contributions one time during a purchase period and (ii) a participant's contribution election may be decreased to 0% at any time during a purchase period to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code or the terms of the ESPP. 
The ESPP provides for two six-month purchase periods in each calendar year unless otherwise determined by the Committee. The first purchase period during a calendar year will generally begin on May 1 and end on October 31 of that year. The second purchase period in a calendar year will generally begin on November 1 and end on April 30 of the following year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the first purchase period after the effective date of the ESPP will begin and end on dates determined by the Committee in its discretion. The Committee has the authority to change the duration of a purchase period (including the start and end date); provided that the change is announced a reasonable period of time prior to its effective date and the purchase period is not greater than 27 months. 
On the first day of a purchase period, a participant will be granted a purchase right to purchase shares of common stock at the applicable purchase price. Subject to the limit below, the number of shares of common stock is determined by dividing the amount of the participant's contributions accumulated as of the last day of the purchase period by the applicable purchase price; provided that (a) no participant may purchase shares of common stock with a fair market value (as of the date of purchase right grant) in excess of $25,000 per calendar year; and (b) in no event will the aggregate number of shares subject to purchase rights during a purchase period exceed the number of shares then available under the ESPP or the maximum number of shares available for any single purchase period (as described below). The number of shares of our common stock that may be purchased by all participants in any particular purchase period is limited to 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in the ESPP), and the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be purchased by any participant during any purchase period is limited to 1,500 shares. The Committee may modify this limit from time to time by resolution or otherwise. The number of shares subject to purchase rights will be adjusted as necessary to conform to the above limitations. 
The purchase price will be 85% (or such greater percentage as determined by the Committee prior to the commencement of any purchase period) of the lesser of (i) fair market value per share of our common stock as determined on the purchase period end date or (ii) fair market value per share of our common stock as determined on the purchase period start date (provided that, in no event may the purchase price be less than the par value per share of our common stock). 
A participant's right to purchase shares of common stock during a purchase period will occur automatically on the purchase period end date unless the participant withdraws or his or her participation is terminated. Subject to the terms of the ESPP, a purchase right will generally terminate on the earlier of the date of the participant's termination of employment or the last day of the applicable purchase period. Purchase rights are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
Amendment; Termination. The ESPP may be amended, altered, suspended and/or terminated at any time by the Board, except that approval of an amendment to the ESPP by our stockholders will be required to the extent that stockholder approval of such amendment is required by applicable law. The Committee may (subject to the provisions of Section 423 of the Code for Section 423 Offerings and the ESPP) amend, alter, suspend and/or terminate any purchase right granted under the ESPP, but (except as otherwise provided in the ESPP) such amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of a purchase right may not, without the written consent of a participant, materially adversely affect the rights of the participant with respect to the purchase right. In addition, the Committee is authorized to amend the ESPP and any purchase right to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law and to make adjustments to purchase rights in recognition of certain unusual or nonrecurring events affecting us or any parent or subsidiary or our financial statements (or those of any parent or subsidiary) or changes in applicable law or accounting principles. 
Eligible Participants. Purchase rights may only be granted to eligible employees of a designated company (as defined below). Generally, any eligible employee who has completed 90 days' employment and who is employed on the date his or her participation is to become effective is eligible to enroll as a participant in the ESPP for any purchase periods that start on or after the 90-day period has concluded. An "eligible employee" is any employee of a designated company except for (i) any employee who is a Section 16(a) officer and/or is subject to disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (ii) any employee who has been employed for less than 90 days or (iii) any employee whose customary employment is for not more than five months in any calendar year. Eligible employees who are citizens or residents of a foreign jurisdiction may be excluded from the ESPP or an offering if the grant of a purchase right would be prohibited by applicable law or would cause the ESPP or offering to violate the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. However, no employee will be eligible to participate if, immediately after the purchase right grant, the employee would own stock (including any stock the employee may purchase under outstanding purchase rights) representing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of our common stock. A "designated company" is Hilton or any subsidiary or affiliate of Hilton, whether now existing or existing in the future, that has been designated by the Committee from time to time in its sole discretion as eligible to participate in the ESPP; provided that only Hilton and its corporate subsidiaries may be designated companies for Section 423 Offerings. The Committee has not yet determined which subsidiaries or affiliates will be "designated companies" for purposes of the ESPP and, accordingly, we are unable to estimate the number of potential participants in the ESPP at this time. 
Effect of a Change in Control; Adjustments. If there is any change in the outstanding shares of our common stock because of a merger, change in control, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization involving Hilton, or if the Board declares a stock dividend, stock split distributable in shares of common stock or reverse stock split, other distribution or combination or reclassification of our common stock, or if there is a similar change in the capital stock structure of Hilton affecting our common stock, then the number and type of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP will be correspondingly adjusted and, subject to applicable law, the Committee will make such adjustments to purchase rights or to any ESPP provision as the Committee deems equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of purchase rights or as may otherwise be advisable. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the Committee's discretion includes, but is not limited to, the authority to provide for any of, or a combination of any of, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· assumption or substitution of purchase rights by a successor entity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· selection of a date on which all outstanding purchase rights will be exercised on or before the consummation date of the  change in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· termination of outstanding purchase rights and refund of accumulated contributions to each participant prior to the change  in control; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· continuation of outstanding purchase rights unchanged.  
[END TABLE]
Plan Benefits. Benefits under the ESPP will depend on participants' elections to participate and the fair market value of our common stock at various future dates. As a result, it is not possible as of the date of this summary to determine future benefits that will be received by executive officers and other employees; provided that, as noted above, employees who are Section 16(a) officers are ineligible to participate in the ESPP. Each participant is limited to the $25,000 annual purchase restriction as well as the participant and purchase period restrictions described above. 
FEDERAL TAX CONSEQUENCES 
The following summary generally describes the principal U.S. federal (and not state, foreign or local) income tax consequences under the ESPP to Hilton and participating employees as of the date of this proxy statement. The summary is general in nature and is not intended to cover all the tax consequences that may apply to a particular employee or Hilton. The provisions of the Code and related regulations concerning these matters are complicated, and their impact in any one case may depend upon the particular circumstances. 
As noted above, the ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code. Under Section 423 of the Code, an employee who elects to participate in the ESPP will not recognize income and Hilton will not receive a deduction at the time a purchase right is granted or when the shares purchased under the ESPP are transferred to the participant. Participants will, however, recognize income when they sell or dispose of the shares purchased under the ESPP. If an employee disposes of such shares after two years from the date of grant of the purchase right and after one year from the date of the purchase of such shares (or if the employee dies), the employee will recognize ordinary income for the year in which such disposition occurs (or the employee's taxable year ending with his or her death) in an amount equal to the lesser of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the excess of the fair market value of such shares at the time of disposition (or death) over the purchase price; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the grant of the purchase right over the purchase right  price on the date of the purchase right grant.  
[END TABLE]
Except in the case of the employee's death, the employee's basis in the shares disposed of will be increased by an amount equal to the amount includable in his or her income as ordinary income. Any additional gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss. Hilton will not be entitled to a tax deduction when the shares are disposed of after the expiration of the two-year and one-year periods. 
If an employee disposes of the shares purchased under the ESPP within such two-year or one-year periods, the employee will recognize ordinary income for the year in which such disposition occurs in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares on the date of purchase over the purchase price. The employee's basis in such shares disposed of will be increased by an amount equal to the amount includable in his or her income as ordinary income, and any gain or loss computed with reference to such adjusted basis that is recognized at the time of disposition will be a capital gain or loss, either short-term or long-term, depending on the holding period for such shares. In the event of a disposition within such two-year or one-year periods, Hilton will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount the employee is required to include as ordinary income as a result of such disposition to the extent the amount represents reasonable compensation and an ordinary and necessary business expense, subject to any required income tax reporting. 
The Committee may authorize offerings that are not intended to comply with Section 423 of the Code, in which case different tax consequences will apply. Upon the purchase of shares under the ESPP, the employee will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares on the date of purchase over the purchase price paid by the employee for such shares, and Hilton will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for federal income tax purposes. In addition, upon the disposition of such shares, the employee will recognize a capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the selling price of such shares and the fair market value of such shares on the date of purchase. Hilton will not receive a deduction for federal income tax purposes with respect to any capital gain or loss recognized by the employee. 
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION 
The following table provides certain information about common stock that may be issued under our existing equity compensation plans. The only plan pursuant to which the Company may grant new equity-based awards is the 2017 Incentive Plan, which replaced the 2013 Incentive Plan. The number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights reflected in the table below includes shares underlying equity-based awards granted, and that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018 under the equity incentive plans.

YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE HILTON 2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. 
PROPOSAL NO. 3 — RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Although ratification is not required by our by-laws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our stockholders for ratification because we value our stockholders' views on the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. If our stockholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered as notice to the Board and the Audit Committee to consider the selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They also will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and they are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The shares represented by your proxy will be voted for the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP unless you specify otherwise.

The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letters from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence.

    Rationale for Target LTI Increase – The Board considered Mr. Nassetta's extensive experience in the hospitality  industry and performance during his ten-plus year tenure as our CEO, as well as their desire for leadership continuity to promote Hilton's long-term growth. As a result, the Board decided to position  Mr. Nassetta's pay more competitively relative to our peers by increasing his target TDC opportunity by $9M. The Board did not raise Mr. Nassetta's base salary or bonus target, but instead increased his target LTI opportunity  – the pay element most aligned with stockholder value over the long term.   During the past  decade under Mr. Nassetta's leadership, Hilton has created significant value for our stockholders, including our IPO in 2013 and the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. in 2017. The spin-offs  completed Hilton's transformation into a fee-based, capital-efficient business model. In the past three years, our stockholders have seen a total stockholder return (including reinvestment of dividends)  of 67%, which is more than double the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index for the same period. Going forward, the Board believes Mr. Nassetta's leadership is key to our continued success at the forefront of the hospitality  industry.

SAY ON PAY VOTE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   In 2018, the Committee considered the outcome of the stockholder advisory vote on  2017 executive compensation when making decisions relating to the compensation of our NEOs and our executive compensation program and policies. Our stockholders voted at our 2018 annual meeting, in a  non-binding, advisory vote, on the 2017 compensation paid to our NEOs. Approximately 97% of the votes were cast in favor of the Company's 2017 compensation decisions, which is similar to prior years.  Based on this level of support, the Committee decided that the Say on Pay vote result did not necessitate any substantive changes to our compensation program.

We consider the opinions expressed by stockholders through their votes, periodic meetings and other communications and believe that stockholder engagement leads to enhanced governance practices. We have a proactive investor outreach program, which includes meetings with the investment community and one-on-one meetings or meetings in small groups. We periodically engage investors to discuss specific matters of importance to stockholders. We value the perspective of our stockholders and will continue to seek their input on an ongoing basis. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PEER GROUP 
To gain a general understanding of current compensation practices, the Committee reviews pay of executives serving in similar positions at peer companies. The external market data reviewed for 2018 included peer group proxy data and broad industry-comparative compensation surveys. The Committee reviews the composition of the peer group on an annual basis in consultation with its independent compensation consultant and considers:

         Comparable size based on annual revenue, system-wide revenue of approximately $43 billion,(1) market capitalization, Adjusted EBITDA and number of employees

CHANGES TO THE PEER GROUP 
The Committee adjusted the peer group in August 2017 in light of the spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (the "spin-offs"), our new capital-efficient business model and Marriott's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. To better reflect our post-spin business characteristics, the Committee reviewed a broad set of potential peers using the criteria outlined above and made the following changes: 
2018 PEER GROUP COMPANIES 
In August 2018, the Committee reviewed and approved the peer group listed in the table below (the "peer group"). This is the peer group the Committee referenced when determining 2018 base salaries, annual cash incentive targets and LTI targets for our executive officers. The peer group consisted of 17 hospitality, travel and global consumer brands and restaurants that have a corporate structure and global presence comparable to the Company.

In structuring our executive compensation packages, the Committee considers how each component of compensation promotes retention and motivates performance. We believe that to attract and retain senior executives, we must provide them with a competitive level of compensation that rewards their continued service. We also believe that performance-based compensation plays the most significant role in aligning management's interests with those of our stockholders. For this reason, performance-based at-risk compensation constitutes the majority of TDC, as illustrated below. 
Our executive compensation program remains consistent with last year and is summarized below, including the performance measures for our annual cash incentives and LTI. The Committee believes that these measures motivate and reward executives for successfully executing our business strategies. Hilton's key strategic priorities are to maximize performance, expand our global footprint, win on customer experience and align our culture and organization.

BASE SALARY 
We believe it is important to provide a competitive fixed level of pay to attract and retain experienced and successful executives. In determining the amount of base salary that each NEO receives, we look to the executive's current compensation, tenure, performance, any change in the executive's position or responsibilities and the complexity and scope of the executive's position as compared to those of other executives within the Company and in similar positions at companies in our peer group. The Committee reviews base salaries periodically and may adjust them from time to time pursuant to such review. 
In 2018, the Committee reviewed and set the base salaries as set forth in the table below, increasing base salaries for all NEOs except for the CEO by 3% to 4%. These increases were consistent with market practices and increases for our corporate team members.

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
Our annual cash incentive program is designed to motivate executive officers to focus on strategic business results and initiatives and reward them for their results and achievements. 
2018 TARGETS FOR ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
Each NEO's target annual cash incentive opportunity is expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary in effect at the end of the performance period. Threshold, target and maximum annual incentive opportunities are approved annually by the Committee based on peer group benchmark data and the scope and impact the executive has on the Company's overall results. For 2018, the Committee set the threshold, target and maximum payout levels as set forth in the table below, which remained the same as 2017.

2018 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES FOR ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
Each NEO's annual cash incentive award opportunity is based on pre-established performance objectives. At the beginning of each performance period, our CEO works with senior management to establish business priorities, which are then used to create the performance objectives. Each objective is given a specific weighting based on its scope, importance and strategic relevance. The weighting for each objective is expressed as a percentage of the NEO's total award opportunity. The Committee then reviews and approves the objectives recommended for each NEO. 
The 2018 annual cash incentive program was based on a combination of financial, business area and organizational strength objectives. The weightings for each of the performance objectives are illustrated below and remain the same as last year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                 Financial – The primary financial performance objective was our Adjusted EBITDA, the key metric we use to assess performance over  the short-term.(1)

             Organizational Strength – Specific to each individual and the function for which he or she is responsible, these objectives  included two equally weighted components: leadership results and talent management. Leadership results were calculated based on responses to questions in our annual global employee engagement survey on leadership, engagement and trust from each  business area. Talent management objectives were designed to cultivate an inclusive environment, demonstrate meaningful progress towards greater workforce diversity and achieve succession planning objectives to support talent movement and business  continuity.

(1)   For each NEO other than Mr. Witter, the financial performance measure was based solely on Adjusted EBITDA, which is  calculated as set forth in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Mr. Witter's  financial measure included both Adjusted EBITDA (20% of his total award opportunity) and Franchise Fees (20% of his total award opportunity). Franchise Fees are presented in the consolidated statements of operations in our audited consolidated  financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2018 PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
At the beginning of the fiscal year following the end of the performance period, each goal is assessed and rated based on the level of achievement. The Finance and Human Resources departments review the achievement of each performance objective against the predetermined objectives with the CEO. The CEO then reviews these results with the Committee and recommends payout amounts under the annual cash incentive plan for each of the NEOs, other than himself. The Committee reviews and assesses each NEO's achievement towards the executive's goals and determines and approves the achievement level used to calculate the actual annual cash incentive award payable to each NEO. 
Financial Performance Measure Results 
Actual annual cash incentive awards were calculated by multiplying each NEO's actual base salary by his or her respective target award potential, which was then adjusted by the combined achievement of the financial, business area and organizational strength performance objectives. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the NEOs' target cash incentive opportunity and their cash incentive award earned (as reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table") were as follows:

LTI PROGRAM 
The LTI program is designed to reward for future Company performance, align with the long-term interests of our stockholders and retain executives. LTI compensation is awarded annually under the Incentive Plans and provides an opportunity for executive officers and other key employees to increase their ownership interest in the Company through grants of equity-based awards. 
2018 LTI TARGETS 
Each NEO's target LTI opportunity is set as a percentage of base salary and approved annually by the Committee based on peer group benchmark data and the scope and impact the executive has on the Company's overall results. For 2018, the Committee set the target pay levels as set forth in the table below. The increases were made after considering individual performance, level of pay relative to the market and internal equity. 
For the CEO, the Board considered his extensive experience in the hospitality industry and performance during his ten-plus year tenure as our CEO, as well as their desire for leadership continuity to promote Hilton's long-term growth. As a result, the Board decided to position Mr. Nassetta's pay more competitively relative to our peers by increasing his target TDC opportunity. The Board did not raise Mr. Nassetta's base salary or bonus target, but instead increased his target LTI opportunity – the pay element most aligned with stockholder value over the long term. During the past decade under Mr. Nassetta's leadership, Hilton has created significant value for our stockholders, including our IPO in 2013 and the spin-offs in 2017. The spin-offs completed Hilton's transformation into a fee-based, capital-efficient business model. In the past three years, our stockholders have seen a total stockholder return (including reinvestment of dividends) of 67%, which is more than double the S&P 500 Index for the same period. Going forward, the Board believes Mr. Nassetta's leadership is key to our continued success at the forefront of the hospitality industry.

(1)   The dollar values above represent the nominal amounts used to determine the number of performance award units, RSUs and  stock options granted. For the grant date fair value of the 2018 awards computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, see the "Summary Compensation Table" and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table."  
[END TABLE]
2018 LTI GRANTS 
In February 2018, the Committee granted LTI awards at 100% of target. Grants under the LTI program were delivered using a blended equity portfolio, with 50% of the total LTI award amount for each NEO delivered in performance awards, 25% in RSUs and 25% in stock options. The largest portion of the total equity award takes the form of performance awards to incentivize our NEOs to achieve our most critical long-term objectives, with the remaining portion equally split between RSUs and stock options to promote retention, serve as a linkage to stockholder value and increase NEOs' ownership interest in the Company. 
PERFORMANCE AWARDS GRANTED IN 2018 
Performance shares are intended to focus our executives on the long-term financial performance of the Company and vest based on a three-year performance period. For the performance awards granted in 2018, the Committee chose FCF per share CAGR and EBITDA CAGR as performance measures because they align management's interests with stockholders and incentivize management to achieve the Company's long-term strategy. The Committee will determine the number of performance awards earned based on the level of achievement of each of the performance goals after the three-year performance period, as illustrated below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   FCF per share is calculated as: (a) net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reported in accordance with  U.S. GAAP, less (b) capital expenditures as disclosed by the Company in reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, plus (c) costs and expenses, including tax payments, relating to asset purchases and disposals, including the spin-offs of  Park and HGV and (d) excluding the impact on annual adjusted free cash flow resulting from any loyalty program advanced point sales; the result of which is divided by (e) the reported diluted weighted number of shares outstanding for the  last calendar year being measured.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   In order to receive a payout, actual performance must exceed the threshold performance goal. For actual performance  between the specified threshold, target and maximum levels, the resulting payout percentage will be adjusted on a linear basis.  
[END TABLE]
TREATMENT OF LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS UPON TERMINATION, CHANGE IN CONTROL OR RETIREMENT 
Each equity-based award subjects the holder to restrictive covenants, including post-employment covenants not to solicit the Company's employees or customers and not to compete against the Company for 12 months following any termination of employment, and indefinite covenants covering trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disparagement. Under the award agreements, if there is a restrictive covenant violation or the Company determines after termination that grounds for a termination for cause existed, the executive will be required to pay the Company an amount equal to the after-tax proceeds received upon the sale or other disposition or distributions in respect of the equity award and any shares issued in respect thereof. Further, each of these executives' equity-based awards is subject to the Company's Clawback Policy (described in the "Clawback Policy" section). Additional provisions are outlined in the table below.

Those eligible to participate in the EDCP could elect to defer up to 80% of their annual  salary and up to 100% of their bonus. The Company did not provide a contribution or match to the EDCP. As of December 31, 2018, the EDCP was frozen, meaning no new participants may enter the plan and no compensation that is earned after  December 31, 2018 may be deferred.

In addition to our 401(k) plan and EDCP, Mr. Carter participates in two of our defined benefit pension plans, the Hilton U.K. Pension Plan (the "U.K. Pension Plan") and the Hilton U.K. Hotels Employer-Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme (the "Supplemental U.K. Plan"), because of his previous service as Chief Executive Officer of Hilton International. Mr. Carter ceased further pensionable service under both plans in 2009. See the "2018 Pension Benefits" table for a description of these defined benefit pension plans. 
SEVERANCE PLAN 
The Committee believes that a carefully structured severance plan is necessary to attract and retain talent. Our severance plan allows executives to focus their attention and energy on making objective business decisions that are in the best interest of stockholders. In addition, the Committee believes that the interests of our stockholders are better protected and enhanced by providing greater certainty regarding executive pay obligations in the context of planning and negotiating any potential corporate transactions. 
In August 2018, the Committee renewed the Company's existing executive severance plan, which was adopted at the time of the Company's IPO in 2013 and expired at the end of 2018. Under the terms of the 2019 Executive Severance Plan effective January 1, 2019 (the "Severance Plan"), if an eligible executive's employment is terminated by us without "cause," or if the eligible employee terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (each, a "qualifying termination"), then, subject to the eligible employee's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims against us, continued compliance with restrictive covenants related to post-employment non-solicitation and non-compete covenants for one year following termination, and indefinite covenants covering confidentiality and non-disparagement, he or she will be eligible to receive a severance payment amount based on the employee's position and then-current base salary and target bonus. Under the terms of the Severance Plan, our NEOs will be eligible to receive a severance payment equal to 2.0 times (2.99 times in the case of Mr. Nassetta) the sum of his or her annual base salary and annual target bonus at the time of termination, paid in a lump sum. In addition, upon a qualifying termination, the NEO will be entitled to certain continued health and welfare benefits, as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
The NEOs will also be entitled to the same level of severance upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control except that severance may be reduced if doing so would result in the executive realizing a better after-tax result following the imposition of any applicable golden parachute excise taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999. 
In addition to the Severance Plan, any compensation and benefits to be made in connection with a separation are determined at the discretion of the Committee and may be based on the executive, his or her position, the nature of the separation and the respective executive's compliance with specified post-termination restrictive covenants. 
KEY EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES 
We follow key executive compensation practices that promote good governance and serve the interests of our stockholders, as summarized below.

         Apply double trigger vesting in the event of a change in control – Cash severance benefits are payable and vesting of equity awards is accelerated only upon a "double trigger," meaning when an  executive's employment is terminated following a change in control. For performance awards, the Committee implemented double trigger vesting beginning with grants made in 2017 to better align with market practices and stockholder interests. As  a result, all of the Company's outstanding equity awards accelerate vesting only upon a double trigger.

OWNERSHIP POLICY 
We have adopted an executive stock ownership policy for our NEOs. Each of our NEOs is expected to own shares of our common stock in the following amounts within five years from the later of February 19, 2014 and the date he or she first becomes subject to the stock ownership policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Role      Salary Multiple       
     Role      Salary Multiple       
    CEO      5 times base salary      
    CEO      5 times base salary      
    Other Executive Officers      3 times base salary      
    Other Executive Officers      3 times base salary      
[END TABLE]
Each NEO currently satisfies the stock ownership requirement above. Under this requirement, executives may not dispose of any shares of the Company they acquire, including, but not limited to, any shares of vested restricted stock, any shares underlying vested restricted stock units, net of taxes, or any shares acquired upon the exercise of any stock options, net of taxes and payment of any exercise price, in each case, received from grants made until the ownership requirements are satisfied. This restriction does not apply to any shares of our common stock received by the executive in exchange for his or her equity held prior to our IPO. 
CLAWBACK POLICY 
We have adopted a clawback policy for our incentive compensation. The Committee determined that it may be appropriate to recover annual and/or LTI compensation from its current or former officers subject to reporting under Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any other employee designated by the Committee in specified situations. These situations include if such employee was overpaid as a result of a restatement of the reported financial results of the Company or any of its segments due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements (unless due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law) caused or contributed to by such employee's fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. If these situations occur, the Committee will review the incentive compensation paid, granted, vested or accrued based on the prior inaccurate results and determine whether to seek recovery of any excess incentive compensation paid or earned as a result of such inaccurate results. 
STOCK AWARD GRANTING POLICY 
The annual grant of stock-based awards to our NEOs is approved on the date of the first regularly scheduled Committee meeting of the calendar year (typically held in the first quarter). In addition to annual awards, other grants may be awarded at other times: (1) to attract new hires; (2) to recognize employees for special achievements or for retention purposes; (3) to new employees as a result of the acquisition of another company; or (4) as may be desirable and prudent in other special circumstances. The exercise price of stock options is the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We monitor and periodically review our equity grant policies to ensure compliance with plan rules and applicable law. We do not have a program, plan or practice to time our equity grants in coordination with the release of material, non-public information. 
RISK CONSIDERATIONS 
The Committee believes that the design and objectives of our executive compensation program provide an appropriate balance of incentives for executives and avoid inappropriate risks. In this regard, our executive compensation program includes the following design features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Balances fixed versus at-risk compensation  
[END TABLE]

· Balances short-term cash and LTI compensation

IRS CODE SECTION 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits the Company's federal income tax deduction for any compensation in excess of one million dollars paid to NEOs (except for the CFO, in the case of tax years preceding 2018). For tax years prior to 2018, the deductibility limitation under Section 162(m) did not apply to certain "performance-based compensation" arrangements or certain awards granted or paid during the Company's post-IPO "transition period" under Section 162(m) (which ended on the date of our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders). However, due to amendments to Section 162(m), the "performance-based compensation" exception is no longer available for compensation paid with respect to fiscal 2018 and future years (unless paid pursuant to certain pre-November 2, 2017 contractual arrangements). 
Accordingly, while the Committee takes the deductibility limitations of Section 162(m) into account in its compensation decisions, we expect to authorize compensation payments that are not exempt under Section 162(m) when the Committee believes that such payments are appropriate to attract or retain talent.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Amounts in this column are not reported as compensation for fiscal year 2018 in the "Summary Compensation Table"  since they do not reflect above-market or preferential earnings. Deferrals may be allocated among investment options that generally mirror the investment options available under our qualified 401(k) plan. Of the available investment options, the one-year rate of return during 2018 ranged from -19.77% to 4.14%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   Mr. Nassetta made no contributions during fiscal years 2016, 2017 or 2018 and, therefore, no amounts in this column  have previously been reported in the "Summary Compensation Table."  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to our EDCP, specified eligible employees, including our NEOs, were permitted to defer up to 80% of their annual salary and up to 100% of their bonus. Deferral elections were made by eligible employees in the calendar year preceding the year compensation is otherwise payable. In 2018, contributions to the EDCP consisted solely of participants' elective deferral contributions and the Company did not provide matching contributions. Eligible employees are permitted to make individual investment elections that will determine the rate of return on their deferral amounts under the elective nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Participants may change their investment elections at any time. Deferrals are only deemed to be invested in the investment options selected. Participants have no ownership interest in any of the funds as investment elections are used only as an index for crediting gains or losses to participants' accounts. The investment options consist of a variety of well-known mutual funds including certain non-publicly traded mutual funds available through variable insurance products. Investment gains or losses in the funds are credited to the participants' accounts daily, net of investment option related expenses. The EDCP does not provide any above-market returns or preferential earnings to participants, and the deferrals and their earnings are always 100% vested. 
NEOs were permitted to elect to receive in-service distributions of such amounts at the time they make their deferral elections. In addition, upon a showing of financial hardship due to death, illness, accident or similar extraordinary or unforeseeable circumstances, an executive may be allowed to access funds in the executive's deferred compensation account before he or she otherwise would have been eligible. The participant must make two payout elections, one in the case of termination and one in the case of retirement. Benefits can generally be received either as a lump sum payment or in installments over a period not to exceed 20 years in the case of retirement, 5 years in the case of termination and 5 years for in-service distributions. In the event of a change in control, 100% of the value of the eligible employee's deferred compensation account will be distributed. 
As of December 31, 2018, the EDCP was frozen, meaning no new participants may enter the plan and no compensation earned after December 31, 2018 may be deferred. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION 
OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
The following table describes the potential payments and benefits that would have been payable to our NEOs under existing plans assuming a termination of employment on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the table do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided generally to all salaried employees upon termination of employment and do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of the NEOs. Distributions of plan balances that would be made are set forth in the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table. 
Because the disclosures in the table assume the occurrence of a termination as of a particular date and under a particular set of circumstances and therefore make a number of important assumptions, the actual amount to be paid to each of our NEOs upon a termination may vary significantly from the amounts included herein. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the continued availability of benefit policies at similar prices and the type of termination event that occurs.

● Performance awards: If the NEOs employment terminates as a result of death or disability, a prorated portion of the  performance awards will immediately vest at target levels, with such proration based on the number of days in the performance period that have elapsed. Upon a double trigger following a change in control, the performance awards will immediately vest  based on actual performance through the most recently completed fiscal quarter or at a level as determined by the Committee in its good faith discretion. The amounts reported in the table above for double trigger vesting are based on the  Companys performance as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]

● RSUs: Upon a double trigger following a change in control or due to the executives death or disability, all unvested  RSUs will immediately vest.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Stock options: Upon a double trigger following a change in control or due to the executives death or disability, all  unvested options will immediately vest and become exercisable. In the table above, amounts reported reflect the spread, or difference between the exercise price and closing price as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
PAY RATIO 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we estimate that the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 542:1 based on the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The annual total compensation of our CEO was $19,803,897(1)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The annual total compensation of our median employee was $36,530(2)  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, annual total compensation now also includes Company-paid healthcare benefits because they are part of the total rewards that employees receive. In order for employees to tailor their benefits to individual circumstances, our benefits programs offer a variety of choices in coverage. The healthcare figures reflected above correspond to the selections each of these employees made when they enrolled in benefits. 
In order to identify the median employee, we used the methodology described below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● As of October 1, 2017 (our Determination Date), we collected data for all employees globally and used base  pay as our consistently applied compensation measure. For hourly workers, we calculated annual base pay based on a reasonable estimate of hours worked during 2017, and used salary levels for salaried employees. We annualized pay for permanent  employees who commenced work during 2017. Consistent with SEC guidance, we used reasonable estimates to determine the base pay for a small portion of our employee population. We identified employees within a narrow range of the estimated median and  then employed statistical sampling to select the median employee from within that range.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For 2018, we are using the same median employee identified in 2017 because we reasonably believe there has been no change in  the employee population or employee compensation arrangements that would significantly affect the pay ratio disclosure.  
[END TABLE]
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules and the methodology described above. The SEC allows companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Therefore, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the members of the Compensation Committee were Ms. Healey, Ms. McHale and Mr. Schreiber, none of whom was, during the fiscal year, an officer or employee of the Company and none of whom was formerly an officer of the Company. During 2018, none of our executive officers served as a director or member of the compensation committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity whose executive officers served on our Compensation Committee or our Board.

Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and written representations, we believe that our executive officers and directors complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during 2018. 
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Our Board of Directors recognizes that transactions with related persons present a heightened risk of conflicts of interests and/or improper valuation (or the perception thereof). Our Board has adopted a written policy on transactions with related persons that is in conformity with the requirements for issuers having publicly-held common stock listed on the NYSE. Our related person transaction policy requires that a "related person" (as defined as in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, which includes security holders who beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock) must promptly disclose to our General Counsel any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The General Counsel will then promptly communicate that information to our Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board (currently the Audit Committee). No related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our Board or a duly authorized committee of the Board. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest. Each of the transactions described below was approved in accordance with our policy on transactions with related persons. 
HNA 
Stockholders Agreement. Our stockholders agreement with HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "HNA") was amended on April 9, 2018 pursuant to a master amendment and option agreement (the "MAOA") that, among other things, permitted HNA to sell all of its shares of our common stock and granted us an option to repurchase shares of common stock from HNA. As of the date of execution of the MAOA, HNA held 82,500,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 26% of our outstanding shares and had designated two directors to our Board pursuant to the stockholders agreement. On April 13, 2018, HNA completed an underwritten public offering of 66,000,000 shares of our common stock and on April 18, 2018 completed its sale to us of its remaining 16,500,000 shares of our common stock (as described below). As a result of HNA ceasing to beneficially own any shares of our common stock, HNA's right to designate directors to our Board, and certain other rights and obligations under the stockholders agreement, terminated. 
Registration Rights. During 2018, we had a registration rights agreement with HNA that provided certain "demand" and "piggyback" registration rights. The registration rights agreement required the Company to pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holder against certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The registration rights agreement was amended on April 9, 2018 pursuant to the MAOA to, among other things, permit HNA's April 2018 underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock and to require HNA to pay for certain related expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses of our legal counsels and accounting and tax advisors. HNA reimbursed us approximately $2.8 million in aggregate in connection with the underwritten public offering. As a result of HNA ceasing to beneficially own any shares of our common stock, the registration rights agreement terminated. 
Management, Franchise, Products and Services. We currently manage or franchise, and may manage or franchise in the future, hotels that are directly or indirectly owned by affiliates of HNA on terms that are consistent with our standard forms of agreement. We recognized management and franchise fee revenue of approximately $0.3 million for the portion of the year in which HNA held more than 5% of our common stock related to these hotels. During that same period, we recognized reimbursements and reimbursable costs for these hotels, primarily related to payroll and marketing expenses, of less than $0.1 million. We also entered into ordinary course transactions with affiliates of HNA for the purchase of goods and services. 
Share Repurchase. In May 2018, we repurchased 16,500,000 shares of our common stock directly from HNA for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $1.2 billion (at a price per share that was 1% less than the price per share paid to HNA by the underwriters in the underwritten public offering described above). 
BLACKSTONE 
Stockholders Agreement. In connection with our 2013 initial public offering, we entered into a stockholders agreement with Blackstone. This agreement required us to, among other things, nominate a number of individuals designated by Blackstone for election as our directors at any meeting of our stockholders based on the percentage of Blackstone's beneficial ownership of our outstanding common stock. As a result of Blackstone's May 2018 sale of 15,800,000 shares of our common stock to third-party investors in privately-negotiated transactions and our repurchase of 1,250,000 shares of common stock from Blackstone (as described below), Blackstone's right to designate directors to our Board, and certain other rights and obligations under the stockholders agreement, terminated. 
Registration Rights Agreement. During 2018, we were party to a registration rights agreement that provided Blackstone customary "demand" and "piggyback" registration rights. The registration rights agreement also provided that we would pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holders against certain liabilities that may arise under the Securities Act. 
Management, Franchise, Products and Services. We currently manage or franchise, and may manage or franchise in the future, hotels that are directly or indirectly owned by affiliates of Blackstone on terms that are consistent with our standard forms of agreement. We recognized management and franchise fee revenue of approximately $15.6 million for the portion of the year in which Blackstone held more than 5% of our common stock related to these hotels. During that same period, we recognized reimbursements and reimbursable costs for these hotels, primarily related to payroll and marketing expenses, of approximately $113.0 million. As of May 31, 2018, we had accounts receivable due from these hotels related to these management and franchise fees and reimbursements of approximately $38.2 million. 
From time to time, we have purchased products and services from entities affiliated with or owned by Blackstone. In certain negotiated instances, these arrangements may permit our hotels, as well as hotels controlled by affiliates of Blackstone, to elect whether or not to contract with such third-party providers on the terms we negotiated. 
Share Repurchase. In May 2018, we repurchased 1,250,000 shares of our common stock directly from Blackstone for approximately $0.1 billion in aggregate. 
2017 SPIN-OFF AGREEMENTS 
In connection with our January 2017 spin-offs of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc., we entered into several agreements with Park and HGV that govern our ongoing relationship. As of March 2018, we no longer consider Park or HGV to be a related person of Hilton following the respective dispositions by HNA of its entire interest in each of Park and HGV. 
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS 
T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. is a beneficial holder of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock according to a Schedule 13G that it filed with the SEC on February 14, 2019. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, Inc. provides recordkeeping and management services for three of the Company's retirement savings plans and received in 2018, in the aggregate, approximately $5.6 million for investment management services and approximately $1.0 million for recordkeeping services in connection with the three plans. Mr. Schreiber, a director trustee of a number of mutual funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates and a member of our Board, has no financial interest in the foregoing described services provided by T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, Inc. 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors or executive officers, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. 
There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Why am I being provided with these materials? 
We have made our proxy materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, delivered printed versions of these proxy materials to you by mail in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting, and at any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. Directors, officers and other Company employees also may solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise. Brokers and other nominees will be requested to solicit proxies or authorizations from beneficial owners and will be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. 
What am I voting on? 
There are four proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Proposal No. 1: Election of the director nominees listed in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Proposal No. 2: Approval of the Hilton 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Proposal No. 3: Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public  accounting firm for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Proposal No. 4: Approval, in a non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation  paid to the named executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote? 
Stockholders as of the close of business on March 15, 2019 (the "Record Date") may vote at the Annual Meeting. As of that date, there were 292,296,383 shares of common stock outstanding. You have one vote for each share of common stock held by you as of the Record Date, including shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Held directly in your name as "stockholder of record" (also referred to as "registered stockholder");  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Held for you in an account with a broker, bank or other nominee (shares held in "street name") — Street name  holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and instead must instruct the brokerage firm, bank or nominee how to vote their shares.  
[END TABLE]
What constitutes a quorum? 
The holders of record of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Shares represented by "broker non-votes" also are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. However, as described below under "How are votes counted?" if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote (a "broker non-vote"). 
What is a "broker non-vote"?
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a broker are not voted with respect to a proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting instructions from the stockholder who beneficially owns the shares and (2) the broker lacks the authority to vote the shares at their discretion. Under current NYSE interpretations that govern broker non-votes, Proposal Nos. 1, 2 and 4 are considered non-discretionary matters, and a broker will lack the authority to vote uninstructed shares at their discretion on such proposals. Proposal No. 3 is considered a discretionary matter, and a broker will be permitted to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on the proposal. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
For all proposals being considered at the Annual Meeting, approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. While the vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 4) is advisory in nature and non-binding, the Board will review the voting results and expects to take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. There is no cumulative voting in director elections. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our procedures if a director nominee is nominated in an uncontested election but receives a majority of "against" votes. In an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "against" from his or her election than votes "for" such election is required to tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is required to consider all relevant factors and make recommendations to the Board with respect to any such letter of resignation. The Board is required to take action with respect to this recommendation within 90 days after certification of the election results. 
How are votes counted? 
The table below summarizes the proposals that will be voted on, the vote required to approve each item and how votes are counted:

 Proposal 1: Election of the director  nominees listed in this Proxy Statement    Majority of votes cast: Votes "FOR" must exceed votes "AGAINST" (3)    "FOR" "AGAINST" "ABSTAIN"   No (4)   None

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   If you just sign and submit your proxy card without voting instructions, your shares will be voted "FOR" each  director nominee listed herein and on the other proposals as recommended by the Board and in accordance with the discretion of the holders of the proxy with respect to any other matters that may be voted upon.

(2)   Abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will not affect the outcome of these proposals.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)   In an uncontested election of directors at which a quorum is present, any nominee who receives a greater number of votes  cast "FOR" his or her election than votes cast "AGAINST" his or her election will be elected to the Board of Directors. An incumbent nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast is expected to tender his or her  resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then consider and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation.

(4)   Broker non-votes with respect to this proposal are not counted as votes cast and  will, therefore, not affect the outcome of this proposal.

In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. Please refer to information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions.

What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability on or about the same time?

May I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
Yes. Whether you have voted by Internet, telephone or mail, if you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote and revoke your proxy by:

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR INCLUSION IN 2020 PROXY STATEMENT (OTHER THAN DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS) 
To be eligible for inclusion in the proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, under the SEC's stockholder proposal rule (Rule 14a-8(e) of the Exchange Act), a proposal must be received by our Secretary on or before November 30, 2019. The proposal should be mailed by certified mail return receipt requested to our Office of the Corporate Secretary, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, Virginia 22102. Failure to deliver a proposal in accordance with this procedure may result in it not being deemed timely received. 
STOCKHOLDER DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS FOR INCLUSION IN 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 
Written notice of stockholder nominations to our Board of Directors that are to be included in the proxy statement pursuant to the proxy access provisions in Article I, Section 12 of our by-laws must be delivered to our Secretary no earlier than 150 nor later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Accordingly, any eligible stockholder who wishes to have a nomination considered at the 2020 Annual Meeting and included in our proxy statement must deliver a written notice (containing the information specified in our by-laws) to our Secretary on or after December 11, 2019, but not later than January 10, 2020. 
STOCKHOLDER DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND OTHER STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR PRESENTATION AT THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING NOT INCLUDED IN 2020 PROXY STATEMENT 
To make a director nomination or present other business for consideration at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 that will not be included in the proxy statement, you must submit a timely notice in accordance with the procedures described in our by-laws. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary not less than 90 days or more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, to be presented at our 2020 Annual Meeting, such a proposal must be received on or after January 10, 2020, but not later than February 9, 2020. In the event that the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 is advanced by more than 20 days, or delayed by more than 70 days, from the anniversary date of this year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, such notice by the stockholder must be so received no earlier than 120 days prior to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 and not later than the 90th day prior to such Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 or 10 calendar days following the day on which public announcement of the date of such Annual Meeting is first made. Any such proposal will be considered timely only if it is otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in our by-laws. The proxy solicited by the Board for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will confer discretionary authority to vote as the proxy holders deem advisable on such stockholder proposals that are considered untimely. 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This Proxy Statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "Executive Compensation." In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as "outlook," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "could," "seeks," "projects," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others, risks inherent to the hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond Hilton's control, competition for hotel guests and management and franchise contracts, risks related to doing business with third-party hotel owners, performance of Hilton's information technology systems, growth of reservation channels outside of Hilton's system, risks of doing business outside of the U.S. and Hilton's indebtedness. Additional factors that could cause Hilton's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under the section entitled "Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Hilton's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC, as such factors may be updated from time to time in Hilton's periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Proxy Statement and in Hilton's filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," provides cost savings for companies and helps the environment by conserving natural resources. Some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, please notify your broker. You can also request prompt delivery of a copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report by contacting the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., 7930 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 1100, McLean, Virginia 22102. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board does not know of any other matters to be brought before the meeting. If other matters are presented, the proxy holders have discretionary authority to vote all proxies in accordance with their best judgment.

ANNEX A – 
NON-GAAP MEASURES 
This proxy statement refers to certain financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA appear on the next page. All results herein reflect the adoption of new accounting standards, including Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"). 
ADJUSTED EBITDA 
Earnings before interest expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), presented herein, reflects net income, excluding interest expense, a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. 
Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses, revenues and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated equity investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("FF&E") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) reorganization costs; (vi) share-based compensation expense; (vii) non-cash impairment losses; (viii) severance, relocation and other expenses; (ix) amortization of contract acquisition costs; (x) the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties; and (xi) other items. 
During the first quarter of 2018, the Company modified the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude the amortization of contract acquisition costs and the net effect of reimbursable costs included in other revenues and expenses from managed and franchised properties. Management believes that excluding these items is useful for the reasons set forth below and has applied the modified definition of Adjusted EBITDA to the table shown on the next page 
The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about the Company and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by the Company's management team to evaluate its operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in the industry. Additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within the Company's industry. For instance, interest expense and the provision for income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, the Company's capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore could vary significantly across companies. Depreciation and amortization, as well as amortization of contract acquisition costs, are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used. For Adjusted EBITDA, the Company also excludes items such as (i) FF&E replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of FF&E for its owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the FF&E; (ii) share-based compensation expense, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (iii) the net effect of the Company's cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, as the Company contractually does not operate the related programs to generate a profit over the terms of the respective contracts; and (iv) other items that are not core to the Company's operations and are not reflective of the Company's performance. 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives, in isolation or as a substitute, to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may have limitations as analytical tools.

3.  Administration  
[END TABLE]
(a)    The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, unless the Board elects to assume administration of the Plan in whole or in part. References to the "Committee" include the Board if it is acting in an administrative capacity with respect to the Plan. Committee members shall be intended to qualify as "independent directors" (or terms of similar meaning) if and to the extent required under Applicable Law. However, the fact that a Committee member shall fail to qualify as an independent director shall not invalidate any Purchase Right or other action taken by the Committee under the Plan. 
(b)        In addition to action by meeting in accordance with Applicable Law, any action of the Committee may be taken by a written instrument signed by all of the members of the Committee and any action so taken by written consent shall be as fully effective as if it had been taken by a majority of the members at a meeting duly held and called. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and Applicable Law, the Committee shall have full and final authority, in its discretion, to take any action with respect to the Plan, including, without limitation, the following: (i) to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan; (ii) to prescribe the form(s) of any agreements or other instruments used in connection with the Plan; (iii) to determine the terms and provisions of the Purchase Rights granted under the Plan; (iv) determine eligibility and adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan, including whether Eligible Employees shall participate in a Section 423 Offering or a Non-Section 423 Offering and which Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be Designated Companies participating in either a Section 423 Offering or a Non-Section 423 Offering; and (v) to construe and interpret the Plan, the Purchase Rights, the rules and regulations, and the agreements or other written instruments, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, the adoption of such Sub-Plans as are necessary or appropriate to permit the participation in the Plan by Eligible Employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, as further set forth in Section 3(c) below. The determinations of the Committee on all matters regarding the Plan shall be conclusive. Except to the extent prohibited by the Plan or Applicable Law, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be established by the Committee, the Committee may appoint one or more agents to assist in the administration of the Plan and may delegate any part of its responsibilities and powers to any such person or persons appointed by it. No member of the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall be liable while acting as administrator for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Purchase Right granted thereunder. 
(c)        Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Committee may adopt such Sub-Plans relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures for jurisdictions outside of the United States, the terms of which Sub-Plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section 4 hereof, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such Sub-Plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern the operation of such Sub-Plan. To the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section 423, any such Sub-Plan shall be considered part of a Non-Section 423 Offering, and Purchase Rights granted thereunder shall not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Code Section 423. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is authorized to adopt Sub-Plans for particular non-U.S. jurisdictions that modify the terms of the Plan to meet applicable local requirements regarding, without limitation, (i) eligibility to participate, (ii) the definition of Compensation, (iii) the dates and duration of Purchase Periods or other periods during which Participants may make Contributions towards the purchase of shares of Common Stock, (iv) the method of determining the Purchase Price and the discount from Fair Market Value at which shares of Common Stock may be purchased, (v) any minimum or maximum amount of Contributions a Participant may make during a Purchase Period or other specified period under the applicable Sub-Plan, (vi) the treatment of Purchase Rights upon a Change in Control or a change in capitalization of the Company, (vii) the handling of payroll deductions, (viii) establishment of bank, building society or trust accounts to hold Contributions, (ix) payment of interest, (x) conversion of local currency, (xi) obligations to pay payroll tax, (xii) determination of beneficiary designation requirements, (xiii) withholding procedures and (xiv) handling of share issuances. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Shares Subject to Plan: Limitations on Purchases and Purchase Rights  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Shares Subject to Plan. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for the issuance of shares pursuant to the Plan is 4,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10. Shares of Common Stock distributed pursuant to the Plan shall be authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market or by private purchase. For avoidance of doubt, up to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock reserved under this Section 4(a) may be used to satisfy purchases of shares under Section 423 Offerings and any remaining portion of such maximum number of Shares may be used to satisfy purchases of shares under Non-423 Offerings. The Company hereby reserves sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock to provide for the exercise of Purchase Rights granted hereunder. In the event that any Purchase Right granted under the Plan expires unexercised or is terminated, surrendered or canceled without being exercised, in whole or in part, for any reason, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Purchase Right shall again be available for issuance under the Plan and shall not reduce the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for the grant of Purchase Rights or issuance under the Plan as set forth in the Plan. 
(b)        Limitations on Purchases and Purchase Rights. If, on a given Purchase Period End Date, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Purchase Rights are to be exercised exceeds the number of shares then available under the Plan, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares remaining available for purchase in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine to be equitable, and in no event shall the number of shares offered for purchase during any Purchase Period exceed the number of shares then available under the Plan. In addition, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased during any single Purchase Period shall not exceed 500,000 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10), and, if the number of shares subject to Purchase Rights that would otherwise be granted during a Purchase Period based on accumulated Contributions under Section 6(a) exceeds 500,000 shares, then the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the number of shares subject to each Participant's Purchase Right for that Purchase Period in as uniform a manner as practicable and as the Company shall determine to be equitable, so as not to exceed the 500,000 share limitation for any Purchase Period. Further, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any single Participant during any Purchase Period shall not exceed 1,500 shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10), unless otherwise determined by the Committee. In the event that any pro rata allocation is made pursuant to this Section 4(b), any Contributions of a Participant not applied to the purchase of shares during such Purchase Period shall be returned to such Participant (without interest, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee has authority, by resolution or otherwise, to modify the foregoing limitation on the number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased by a Participant in any particular Purchase Period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  Eligibility and Participation: Payroll Deductions  
[END TABLE]
(a)        General. Purchase Rights may only be granted to Eligible Employees of the Company or a Designated Company. 
(b)        Initial Eligibility. Any Eligible Employee who has completed 90 days' employment and is employed by the Company or a Designated Company will be eligible to be a Participant during any Purchase Period that begins on or after the end such 90-day period. An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee on or after a Purchase Period Start Date will not be eligible to participate in such Purchase Period but may participate in any subsequent Purchase Period, provided such Employee is still an Eligible Employee as of the Purchase Period Start Date of such subsequent Purchase Period. 
(c)        Leave of Absence. For purposes of participation in the Plan, a person on leave of absence shall be deemed to be an Employee for the first 90 days of such leave of absence and such Employee's employment shall be deemed to have terminated at the close of business on the 90th day of such leave of absence unless such Employee shall have returned to regular full-time or part-time employment (as the case may be) prior to the close of business on such 90th day or unless such Employee has a right to reemployment that is guaranteed either by statute or contract (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guaranteed right to reemployment provided under any non-US law, contract or policy). Termination by the Company of any Employee's leave of absence, other than termination of such leave of absence on return to full-time or part-time employment, shall terminate an Employee's employment for all purposes of the Plan and shall terminate such Employee's participation in the Plan and right to exercise any Purchase Right, unless such Employee has a right to reemployment that is guaranteed either by statute or contract. 
(d)        Commencement of Participation. An Eligible Employee shall become a Participant by completing an authorization for Contributions on the form provided by the Committee (and such other documents as may be required by the Committee) and delivering such forms and documents to the Committee or an agent designated by the Committee on or before the date set therefor by the Committee, which date shall be prior to the Purchase Period Start Date for the applicable Purchase Period. Contributions for a Participant during a Purchase Period shall commence on the applicable Purchase Period Start Date when the authorization for a Contribution becomes effective and shall continue for successive Purchase Periods during which the Participant is eligible to participate in the Plan, unless authorizations are withdrawn or participation is terminated, as provided in Section 8. 
(e)        Amount of Contributions: Determination of Compensation. At the time a Participant files an authorization for Contributions, a Participant shall elect to have deductions or other Contributions made from the Participant's pay on each payday while participating in a Purchase Period at a rate of not less than 1% nor more than 15% (in whole percentages only) of Compensation. Such Compensation rates shall be determined by the Committee in a nondiscriminatory manner consistent with the provisions of Code Section 423 in the case of a Section 423 Offering. 
(f)        Participant's Account: No Interest. All Contributions made by a Participant shall be credited to the Participant's account under the Plan. A Participant may not make any separate cash payment into such account unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. In no event shall interest accrue on any Contributions made by a Participant, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. 
(g)        Changes in Payroll Deductions. A Participant may withdraw, terminate or discontinue participation in the Plan as provided in Section 8, but no other change can be made during a Purchase Period except as follows: (1) a Participant may reduce the amount of Contributions for a Purchase Period one time during such Purchase Period (no later than 30 days prior to the end of the Purchase Period) and (2) to the extent necessary to comply with the limitation of Code Section 423(b)(8), or Section 2(l), Section 4 and/or Section 12(a) of the Plan, a Participant's Contribution election may be decreased to 0% at any time during a Purchase Period. In such event, Contributions shall continue at the newly elected rate with respect to the next Purchase Period, unless otherwise provided under the terms of the Plan or as otherwise determined by the Committee. 
(h)        Special Eligibility Rules for Foreign Participants. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(l), Eligible Employees who are citizens or residents of a foreign jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens) may be excluded from the Plan or an Offering if (i) the grant of a Purchase Right under the Plan or Offering to a citizen or resident of the foreign jurisdiction is prohibited under Applicable Law; or (ii) compliance with the Applicable Law would cause the Plan or Offering to violate the requirements of Code Section 423. In the case of a Non-Section 423 Offering, an Eligible Employee (or group of Eligible Employees) may be excluded from participation in the Plan or an Offering if the Committee has determined, in its sole discretion, that participation of such Eligible Employee(s) is not advisable or practicable for any reason. Further, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(l), an Employee who does not otherwise qualify as an Eligible Employee may, in the Committee's discretion, participate in a Non-Section 423 Offering if and to the extent required by Applicable Law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  Grant of Purchase Rights  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Number of Shares Subject to Purchase Right. On the Purchase Period Start Date of each Purchase Period, a Participant shall be granted a Purchase Right to purchase on the Purchase Period End Date of such Purchase Period, at the applicable Purchase Price, such number of shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the amount of the Participant's Contributions accumulated as of the Purchase Period End Date and retained in the Participant's account as of the Purchase Period End Date by the applicable Purchase Price (as determined in accordance with Section 6(b)); provided, however, that (i) no Participant may purchase shares of Common Stock in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 4(b) or Section 12(a), and the number of shares subject to a Purchase Right shall be adjusted as necessary to conform to such limitations; and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate number of shares deemed to be subject to Purchase Rights during a Purchase Period exceed the number of shares then available under the Plan or the number of shares available for any single Purchase Period (as provided in Section 4) and the number of shares deemed to be subject to Purchase Rights shall be adjusted as necessary to conform to these limitations. The Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock shall be determined as provided in Section 2(o) and 6(b), and a Participant's Compensation shall be determined according to Section 2(i). 
(b)    Purchase Price. The Purchase Price per share of Common Stock purchased with Contributions made during a Purchase Period for a Participant shall be equal to 85% (or such greater percentage as may be determined by the Committee prior to the commencement of any Purchase Period) of the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Period End Date or (ii) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Period Start Date; provided that in no event shall the Purchase Price per share of Common Stock be less than the par value per share of the Common Stock and provided further that the Committee may determine prior to a Purchase Period to calculate the Purchase Price for such Purchase Period solely by reference to the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable Purchase Period End Date or Purchase Period Start Date, or based on the greater of such values (rather than the lesser of such values). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  Exercise of Purchase Rights  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Automatic Exercise. Unless a Participant gives written notice to the Company or an agent designated by the Company of withdrawal at least 30 days prior to the end of the Purchase Period or terminates employment as hereinafter provided, the Participant's Purchase Rights for the purchase of shares of Common Stock with Contributions made during any Purchase Period will be deemed to have been exercised automatically on the Purchase Period End Date applicable to such Purchase Period, for the purchase of the number of shares of Common Stock which the accumulated Contributions in the Participant's account at that time will purchase at the applicable Purchase Price (but not in excess of the number of shares for which Purchase Rights have been granted to the Participant pursuant to Section 4 and Section 6(a)). 
(b)        Termination of Purchase Right. A Purchase Right granted during any Purchase Period shall expire on the earlier of (i) the date of termination of the Participant's employment or as otherwise required by Applicable Law, or (ii) the end of the last day of the applicable Purchase Period. 
(c)        Fractional Shares: Excess Amounts. Fractional shares will not be issued under the Plan unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Any excess Contributions in a Participant's account which would have been used to purchase fractional shares will be automatically re-invested in a subsequent Purchase Period unless the Participant timely revokes the Participant's authorization to re-invest such excess amounts or the Company elects to return such Contributions to the Participant. Except as permitted by the foregoing, any amounts that were contributed but not applied toward the purchase of shares of Common Stock will be carried forward to future Purchase Periods unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 
(d)        Share Certificates: Credit to Participant Accounts. As promptly as practicable after the Purchase Period End Date of each Purchase Period, the shares of Common Stock purchased by a Participant for the Purchase Period shall be credited to such Participant's account maintained by the Company, a stock brokerage or other financial services firm designated by the Company or the Participant or other similar entity, unless the Participant elects to have the Company deliver to the Participant certificates for the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right. If a Participant elects to have shares credited to the Participant's account (rather than certificates issued), a report will be made available to such Participant after the close of each Purchase Period stating the entries made to such Participant's account, the number of shares of Common Stock purchased and the applicable Purchase Price. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  Withdrawal: Termination of Employment  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Withdrawal. A Participant may withdraw Contributions credited to the Participant's account during a Purchase Period at any time prior to the applicable Purchase Period End Date by giving sufficient prior written notice to the Committee or an agent designated by the Committee. All of the Participant's Contributions credited to the Participant's account will be paid to the Participant promptly (without interest, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) after receipt of the Participant's notice of withdrawal, and no further Contributions will be made from Compensation during such Purchase Period. The Committee may, at its option, treat any attempt to borrow by an Employee on the security of the Employee's accumulated Contributions as an election to withdraw such Contributions. A Participant's withdrawal from any Purchase Period will not have any effect upon the Participant's eligibility to participate in any succeeding Purchase Period or in any similar plan which may hereafter be adopted by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if a Participant withdraws during a Purchase Period, Contributions shall not resume at the beginning of a succeeding Purchase Period unless the Participant is eligible to participate and the Participant delivers to the Committee or an agent designated by the Committee a new completed authorization form (and such other documents as may be required by the Committee) and otherwise complies with the terms of the Plan. 
(b)        Termination of Employment: Participant Ineligibility. Upon termination of a Participant's employment for any reason (including but not limited to termination due to death but excluding a leave of absence for a period of less than 90 days or a leave of absence of any duration where reemployment is guaranteed by either statute or contract), or in the event that a Participant otherwise ceases to be an Eligible Employee, the Participant's participation in the Plan shall be terminated, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. In the event of a Participant's termination of employment or in the event that a Participant otherwise ceases to be an Eligible Employee, the Contributions credited to the Participant's account will be returned (without interest, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law) to the Participant, or, in the case of death, to a beneficiary duly designated on a form acceptable to the Committee. Any unexercised Purchase Rights granted to a Participant during such Purchase Period shall be deemed to have expired on the date of the Participant's termination of employment or the date the Participant otherwise ceases to be an Eligible Employee (unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 7(b)), and no further Contributions will be made for the Participant's account. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  Transferability  
[END TABLE]
No Purchase Right (or rights attendant to a Purchase Right ) may be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated (whether by operation of law or otherwise), except as provided by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and no Purchase Right will be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of a Purchase Right, or levy of attachment or similar process upon the Purchase Right not specifically permitted in the Plan, will be null and void and without effect. A Purchase Right may be exercised during a Participant's lifetime only by the Participant. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  Dilution and Other Adjustments: Change in Control  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Adjustments: Right to Issue Additional Securities. If there is any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock because of a merger, Change in Control, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization involving the Company, or if the Board declares a stock dividend, stock split distributable in shares of Common Stock or reverse stock split, other distribution (other than ordinary or regular cash dividends) or combination or reclassification of the Common Stock, or if there is a similar change in the capital stock structure of the Company affecting the Common Stock (excluding conversion of convertible securities by the Company and/or the exercise of warrants by their holders), then the number and type of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be correspondingly adjusted, and the Committee shall, subject to Applicable Law, make such adjustments to Purchase Rights (such as the number and type of shares subject to a Purchase Right and the Purchase Price of a Purchase Right or to any provisions of this Plan as the Committee deems equitable to prevent dilution or enlargement of Purchase Rights or as may otherwise be advisable. Nothing in the Plan, a Purchase Right or any related instrument shall limit the ability of the Company to issue additional securities of any type or class. 
(b)        Change in Control. In addition, without limiting the effect of Section 10(a), in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee's discretion shall include but shall not be limited to the authority to provide for any of, or a combination of any of, the following: (i) each Purchase Right shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by the successor entity or parent or subsidiary of such successor entity; (ii) a date selected by the Committee on or before the date of consummation of such Change in Control shall be treated as an Purchase Date and all outstanding Purchase Rights shall be exercised on such date, (iii) all outstanding Purchase Rights shall terminate and the accumulated Contributions will be refunded to each Participant upon or prior to the Change in Control (without interest, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law), or (iv) outstanding Purchase Rights shall continue unchanged. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  Stockholder Approval of Plan  
[END TABLE]
The Plan is subject to the approval by the stockholders of the Company, which approval shall be obtained within 12 months before or after the date of adoption of the Plan by the Board. Amendments to the Plan shall be subject to stockholder approval to the extent, if any, as may be required by Code Section 423 or other Applicable Law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Limitations on Purchase Rights  
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan: 
(a)        No Employee shall be granted a Purchase Right under the Plan which permits the Employee's rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans (as defined in Code Section 423) of the Company and any Related Corporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of such stock (determined at the time of the grant of such Purchase Right) for each calendar year in which such Purchase Right is outstanding at any time in the case of a Section 423 Offering. Any Purchase Right granted under the Plan shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to satisfy this Section 12(a). 
(b)        In accordance with Code Section 423, all Employees granted Purchase Rights under the Plan who are participating in a Section 423 Offering shall have the same rights and privileges under the Plan, except that the amount of Common Stock which may be purchased by any Employee under Purchase Rights granted pursuant to the Plan shall bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation (or the basic or regular rate of compensation) of all Employees. All rules and determinations of the Committee in the administration of the Plan shall be uniformly and consistently applied to all persons in similar circumstances. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Amendment and Termination of the Plan and Purchase Rights  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Amendment and Termination of Plan. The Plan may be amended, altered, suspended and/or terminated at any time by the Board; provided, that approval of an amendment to the Plan by the stockholders of the Company shall be required to the extent, if any, that stockholder approval of such amendment is required by Applicable Law. 
(b)        Amendment and Termination of Purchase Rights. The Committee may (subject to the provisions of Code Section 423 (for Section 423 Offerings) and Section 13(a)) amend, alter, suspend and/or terminate any Purchase Right granted under the Plan, prospectively or retroactively, but (except as otherwise provided in Section 13(c)) such amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of a Purchase Right shall not, without the written consent of a Participant with respect to an outstanding Purchase Right, materially adversely affect the rights of the Participant with respect to the Purchase Right. 
(c)        Amendments to Comply with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding Section 13(a) and Section 13(b), the following provisions shall apply: 
(i) The Committee shall have unilateral authority, subject to the provisions of Code Section 423 (for Section 423 Offerings), to amend the Plan and any Purchase Right (without Participant consent) to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Law or changes to Applicable Law. 
(ii) The Committee shall have unilateral authority to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of Purchase Rights in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or any Related Corporation, or the financial statements of the Company or any Related Corporation, or of changes in Applicable Law, or accounting principles, if the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable accounting principles or Applicable Law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  Designation of Beneficiary  
[END TABLE]
The Committee, in its discretion, may authorize a Participant to designate in writing a person or persons as each such Participant's beneficiary, which beneficiary shall be entitled to the rights, if any, of the Participant in the event of the Participant's death to which the Participant would otherwise be entitled. The Committee shall have discretion to approve the form or forms of such beneficiary designations, to determine whether such beneficiary designations will be accepted, and to interpret such beneficiary designations. If a deceased Participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary does not survive the Participant, any rights that would have been exercisable by the Participant and any benefits distributable to the Participant shall be exercised by or distributed to the legal representative of the estate of the Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  Miscellaneous  
[END TABLE]
(a)        Compliance with Applicable Law. The Company may impose such restrictions on Purchase Rights, shares of Common Stock and any other benefits underlying Purchase Rights hereunder as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under the federal securities laws, the requirements of any stock exchange or similar organization and any blue sky, state or foreign securities or other Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any other Plan provision to the contrary, the Company shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer shares of Common Stock under the Plan or take any other action, unless such delivery or action is in compliance with Applicable Law (including but not limited to the requirements of the Securities Act). The Company will be under no obligation to register shares of Common Stock or other securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission or to effect compliance with the exemption, registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state securities laws, stock exchange or similar organization, and the Company will have no liability for any inability or failure to do so. The Company may cause a restrictive legend or legends to be placed on any certificate issued pursuant to a Purchase Right hereunder in such form as may be prescribed from time to time by Applicable Law or as may be advised by legal counsel. 
(b)        No Obligation To Exercise Purchase Rights. The grant of a Purchase Right shall impose no obligation upon a Participant to exercise such Purchase Right. 
(c)        Application of Funds. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Purchase Rights will be used for general corporate purposes. 
(d)        Taxes. At any time a Participant incurs a taxable event as a result of the Participant's participation in the Plan, a Participant must make adequate provision for any Tax-Related Items. Participants are solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all Tax-Related Items, and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold any Participant harmless from any or all of such Tax-Related Items. The Company shall have no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for a Participant or any other person. 
In their sole discretion, the Company or, as applicable, the Designated Company that employs the Participant, may, unless the Committee determines otherwise, satisfy their obligations to withhold Tax-Related Items by (i) withholding from the Participant's compensation, (ii) repurchasing a sufficient whole number of shares of Common Stock issued following exercise having an aggregate Fair Market Value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock, (iii) withholding from proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise, either through a voluntary sale or a mandatory sale arranged by the Company, or (iv) any other method deemed acceptable by the Committee. 
(e)        Right to Terminate Employment. Nothing in the Plan, a Purchase Right or any agreement or instrument related to the Plan shall confer upon an Employee the right to continue in the employment of the Company, any Related Corporation or Affiliate or affect any right which the Company, any Related Corporation or Affiliate may have to terminate the employment of such Employee. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or under Applicable Law, all rights of a Participant with respect to Purchase Rights granted hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of employment of the Participant. 
(f)        Rights as a Stockholder. No Participant or other person shall have any rights as a stockholder unless and until certificates for shares of Common Stock are issued to the Participant or credited to the Participant's account on the records of the Company or a designee. 
(g)        Notices. Every direction, revocation or notice authorized or required by the Plan shall be deemed delivered to the Company (i) on the date it is personally delivered to the Company at its principal executive offices or (ii) three business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Secretary at such offices, and shall be deemed delivered to an Eligible Employee (i) on the date it is personally delivered to the Eligible Employee or (ii) three business days after it is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Eligible Employee at the last address shown for the Eligible Employee on the records of the Company or of any Related Corporation or Affiliate. 
(h)        Governing Law. All questions pertaining to the validity, construction and administration of the Plan and Purchase Rights granted hereunder shall be determined in conformity with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws, to the extent not inconsistent with Code Section 423 (for Section 423 Offerings) or other applicable federal laws of the United States. 
(i)        Severability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
(j)        Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and words in the plural shall include the singular. 
(k)        Rules of Construction. Headings are given to the sections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. 
(l)        Successors and Assigns. The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns, and Participants, their executors, administrators and permitted transferees and beneficiaries. 
(m)        Purchase Right Documentation. The grant of any Purchase Right under the Plan shall be evidenced by such documentation, if any, as may be determined by the Committee or its designee. Such documentation may state terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the Purchase Right and may state such other terms, conditions and restrictions, including but not limited to terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to shares of Common Stock or other benefits subject to a Purchase Right, as may be established by the Committee. 
(n)        Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent the Plan provides for the issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the issuance may, in the Company's discretion, be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws or by Applicable Law. 
(o)        Compliance with Recoupment, Ownership and Other Policies or Agreements. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary and subject to the provisions of Code Section 423 (for Section 423 Offerings), the Committee may, at any time (during or following termination of employment or service for any reason), determine that a Participant's rights, payments and/or benefits with respect to a Purchase Right (including but not limited to any shares issued or issuable with respect to a Purchase Right) shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any other conditions applicable to a Purchase Right. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of employment for cause, violation of policies of the Company or a Related Corporation or Affiliate, breach of non-solicitation, non-competition, confidentiality, non-disparagement or other covenants, other conduct by the Participant that is determined by the Committee to be detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company, any Related Corporation or Affiliate, and/or other circumstances where such reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment is required by Applicable Law. In addition, without limiting the effect of the foregoing, as a condition to the grant of a Purchase Right or receipt or retention of shares of Common Stock, cash or any other benefit under the Plan, (i) the Committee may, at any time, require that a Participant comply with any compensation recovery (or "clawback"), stock ownership, stock retention or other policies or guidelines adopted by the Company, a Related Corporation or Affiliate, each as in effect from time to time and to the extent applicable to the Participant, and (ii) each Participant shall be subject to such compensation recovery, recoupment, forfeiture or other similar provisions as may apply under Applicable Law. 
(p)        Plan Controls. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, in the event of a conflict between any term or provision contained in the Plan and an express term contained in any documentation related to the Plan, the applicable terms and provisions of the Plan will govern and prevail. 
(q)        Administrative Costs. The Company or a Related Corporation or Affiliate will pay the expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan other than any fees or transfer, excise or similar taxes imposed on the transaction pursuant to which any shares of Common Stock are purchased. The Participant will pay any transaction fees, commissions or similar costs on any sale of shares of Common Stock and may also be charged the reasonable costs associated with issuing a stock certificate or similar matters. 
(r)        Notice of Disqualifying Disposition. Each Participant who participates in a Section 423 Offering and is subject to taxation in the United States shall give the Company prompt written notice of any disposition or other transfer of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of a Purchase Right granted under the Plan if such disposition or transfer is made within two years after the Grant Date or within one year after the Purchase Date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Code Section 409A: Tax  Qualification.  
[END TABLE]
Purchase Rights to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under a Section 423 Offering are exempt from the application of Code Section 409A and Code Section 457A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines that a Purchase Right granted under the Plan may be subject to Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A or that any provision in the Plan would cause a Purchase Right under the Plan to be subject to Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A, the Committee may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of an outstanding Purchase Right granted under the Plan, or take such other action the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant's consent, to exempt any outstanding Purchase Right or future Purchase Right that may be granted under the Plan from or to allow any such Purchase Rights to comply with Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the Committee would not violate Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Participant from any obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties pursuant to Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A. The Company makes no representation that the Purchase Right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan is compliant with Code Section 409A or Code Section 457A.
