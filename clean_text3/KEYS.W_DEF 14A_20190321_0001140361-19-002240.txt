PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Director Nomination Criteria: Qualifications and Experience
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee performs an assessment of the skills and the experience needed to properly oversee the interests of the Company.     Generally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews both the short and long-term strategies of the Company to determine what current and future skills and experience are required of the Board in exercising its oversight function. The     Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then compares those skills to the skills of the current directors and potential director candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts targeted efforts to identify and recruit     individuals who have the qualifications identified through this process. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee looks for its current and potential directors collectively to have a mix of skills and qualifications, some of which are     described below:
In addition to these minimum requirements, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider whether the candidate's skills are complementary to     the existing Board members' skills; the diversity of the Board with respect to factors such as age, race, gender, experience in technology, manufacturing, finance and marketing, international experience and culture; and the Board's needs for specific     operational, management or other expertise. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee from time to time reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members, including factors that it seeks in Board members such as     diversity of business experience, viewpoints and, personal background, and diversity of skills in technology, finance, marketing, international business, financial reporting and other areas that are expected to contribute to an effective Board. In     evaluating potential candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers these factors in the light of the specific needs of the Board at that time.
Current Director Terms
Keysight's Board is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms. Directors for each class are elected at the Annual Meeting held in the year in     which the term for their class expires. Keysight's Bylaws, as amended, allow the Board to fix the number of directors by resolution. Our Board currently consists of seven directors divided into three classes. The terms of the two current director     nominees will expire at this Annual Meeting. The current composition of the Board and the term expiration dates for each director is as follows:
Directors elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will hold office for a three-year term expiring at the annual meeting in 2022 (or until their respective successors     are elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal). In nominating James G. Cullen, who is 76 years old, the Board and Nominating and Governance Committee also considered our director retirement guideline that provides that     no director may be nominated to a new term if he or she would be age 75 or older at the time of the election. The Board and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considered Mr. Cullen's strong understanding of Keysight's business, considerable     managerial and operational experience and expertise and contributions to the Board and the committees on which he sits, as well as the needs of Keysight and the benefit that his continued service on the Board could provide, and determined that     notwithstanding the retirement guideline, it was in the best interest of Keysight and its stockholders to allow for his nomination for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting and continued service until the Annual Meeting in 2022. Accordingly, Keysight's     Board approved an exemption to the Company's retirement age guideline for James G. Cullen. Each nominee is a current director of Keysight, and information regarding each of the nominees is provided below as of December 31, 2018. There are no family     relationships among Keysight's executive officers and directors.

Corporate Governance Matters
Corporate Governance Highlights
The Board is committed to sound and effective governance practices that promote long-term stockholder value and strengthen Board and management accountability to       our stockholders, customers and other stakeholders. The following table highlights many of our key governance practices. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist it in guiding Keysight's governance practices. We have reviewed internally and with the       Board the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the rules of the SEC and the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards regarding corporate governance policies and processes and are in compliance with the applicable       rules and listing standards. These practices are regularly reevaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in light of changing circumstances to ensure that the best interests of the Company and its stockholders are being served. A       copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines is located in the Investor Relations section of our website and can be accessed by clicking on "Governance Policies" in the "Corporate Governance" section of our web page at http://investor.keysight.com.       During fiscal year 2018, Keysight's Board approved an exemption to the Company's retirement age guideline for James G. Cullen who is a director nominee at the Annual Meeting as described in more detail in Proposal 1, Election of Directors.
Communicating with the Board
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board and Keysight's Chairman of the Board by filling out the form at "Contact the Chairman"       under "Corporate Governance" at http://investor.keysight.com or by writing to Paul N. Clark, c/o Keysight Technologies, Inc., General Counsel, 1400 Fountaingrove Parkway, Santa Rosa, CA 95403. The General Counsel will perform a legal review in the       normal discharge of his duties to ensure that communications forwarded to the Chairman of the Board preserve the integrity of the process. For example, items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board such as spam, junk mail       and mass mailings, product complaints, personal employee complaints, product inquiries, new product suggestions, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, surveys, business solicitations or advertisements ("Unrelated Items") will not be forwarded to       the Chairman of the Board. In addition, unrelated items include material that is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable, and will not be forwarded to the Chairman of the Board. Any communication that is relevant to the conduct       of Keysight's business and is not forwarded will be retained for one year (other than Unrelated Items) and made available to the Chairman of the Board and any other independent director upon request. The independent directors grant the general       counsel discretion to decide which correspondence will be shared with Keysight's management and specifically instruct that any personal employee complaints be forwarded to Keysight's Human Resources Department.
Director Qualification Standards
Keysight's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with Keysight's Board the       appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the makeup of the Board and developing criteria for identifying and evaluating Board candidates.       
Board Leadership Structure
Keysight separates the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Mr. Clark, one of Keysight's independent directors, serves as Keysight's     Chairman of the Board. The responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board include setting the agenda for each Board meeting, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer; chairing the meetings of independent directors; and facilitating and     conducting, with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the annual self-assessments by the Board and each standing Committee of the Board, which may periodically include performance reviews of individual directors.
Separating the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus on Keysight's day-to-day business, while     allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and independent oversight of, management. The Board believes that having an independent director serve as Chairman of the Board is the appropriate     leadership structure for Keysight at this time. However, in the future the Board may wish to consider alternative structures, subject to the requirements under Keysight's amended and restated Bylaws.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board executes its risk management responsibility directly and through its Committees. The Audit and Finance Committee has primary responsibility for     overseeing Keysight's enterprise risk management process. The Audit and Finance Committee receives updates and discusses individual and overall risk areas during its meetings, including Keysight's financial risk assessments, risk management policies     and major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Compensation Committee oversees risks associated with Keysight's compensation policies and practices with respect to both executive     compensation and compensation generally. The Compensation Committee receives reports and discusses whether Keysight's compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Board is kept abreast of its Committees' risk oversight and other activities via reports of the Committee chairpersons to the full Board during Board meetings.
We have adopted charters of our Compensation Committee, Audit and Finance Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Executive Committee     consistent with the applicable rules and standards. Our Committee charters are located in the Investor Relations Section of our website and can be accessed by clinking on "Governance policies" in the "Corporate Governance" section of our web page at http://investor.keysight.com.
Majority Voting for Directors
Our Bylaws provide for majority voting of directors regarding director elections. In an uncontested election, any nominee for director shall be elected by the vote     of a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director. The "votes" cast with respect to that     director shall include votes to withhold authority and exclude votes to "ABSTAIN" with respect to that director's election. If a director is not elected due to a failure to receive a majority of the votes cast and his or her successor is not otherwise     elected and qualified, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it, or whether     other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. Thereafter the Board will promptly disclose their decision and the     rationale behind it in a press release to be disseminated in the same manner as Company press releases typically are distributed. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating and     Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer.
Policies              on Business Ethics 
Keysight has adopted a Standards of Business Conduct that requires all its business activities to be conducted in compliance with laws, regulations and ethical     principles and values. All officers and employees of Keysight is required to read, understand and abide by the requirements of the Standards of Business Conduct. Keysight has also adopted a Director Code of Ethics applicable to Keysight's directors.
These documents are accessible on the Company's website at http://investor.keysight.com. Any waiver of these codes for directors or executive officers may be made     only by the Audit and Finance Committee. Keysight will disclose any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of the Standards of Business Conduct for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or     controller, or persons performing similar functions, on the Company's website within four business days following the date of the amendment or waiver. In addition, Keysight will disclose any waiver from these codes for the other executive officers and     for directors on the website.
Director Independence
The majority of Keysight's Board is "independent" as defined by the rules of the NYSE and the Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by the Board. The Board has     affirmatively determined that Paul N. Clark, James G. Cullen, Charles J. Dockendorff, Jean M. Halloran, Richard Hamada and Robert A. Rango are independent. The criteria adopted by Keysight's Board to assist it in making determinations regarding the     independence of its members are consistent with the NYSE listing standards regarding director independence. To be considered independent, the Board has to determine that a director does not have a material relationship with Keysight or its subsidiaries     (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Keysight or its subsidiaries). In assessing independence, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances. In particular, when assessing     the materiality of a director's relationship with Keysight or its subsidiaries, the Board considers the issue not just from the standpoint of the director, but also from that of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation.
Keysight's Board assesses on a regular basis, and at least annually, the independence of directors and, based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate     Governance Committee, make a determination as to which members are independent.
Audit and Finance Committee Member Independence
Keysight has adopted standards for Audit and Finance Committee member independence in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and NYSE     corporate governance listing standards. In affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on the Audit and Finance Committee, the Board must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether such director has     a relationship to Keysight or any of its subsidiaries which is material to such director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of an Audit and Finance Committee member, including, but not limited to:
Charles Dockendorff currently serves on the audit committee of four public companies, including Keysight. The Board has considered whether such simultaneous     service would impair his ability to effectively serve as the chairperson of Keysight's Audit and Finance Committee. In its analysis, the Board considered the committee's demanding roles and responsibilities and the time commitment required by such     service. The Board also considered the skills and expertise of Mr. Dockendorff and the various commitments of his time. After careful consideration, the Board concluded that Mr. Dockendorff's other audit committee service does not impair his ability to     effectively fulfill his responsibilities to Keysight Company at the time and, therefore, the Board has specifically approved his continuation as chairperson of Keysight's Audit and Finance Committee.
The Board has also determined that each of the members of the Audit and Finance Committee are independent.
Compensation Committee Member Independence
Keysight has adopted standards for Compensation Committee member independence in compliance with the SEC and NYSE corporate governance listing standards. In       affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on the Compensation Committee, the Board must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether such director has a relationship to Keysight or any of its       subsidiaries which is material to such director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including, but not limited to:       
The Board has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Board has four standing Committees and their composition as of the end of fiscal year 2018 was as set forth in the table below. The Board held six meetings     during fiscal year 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which each such director served, during the     period for which each such director served. The members of the committees, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, and the number of Board and committee meetings during fiscal 2018 are identified in the following table.
Keysight encourages, but does not require, its Board members to attend the annual stockholders meeting. In 2018, all of Keysight's then-sitting directors attended the annual     stockholders meeting.
Audit and Finance Committee
The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the oversight of the quality and integrity of Keysight's consolidated financial statements, its compliance with     legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of its independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of its internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm and other significant     financial matters. In discharging its duties, the Audit and Finance Committee is expected to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● have the sole authority to appoint, retain, compensate, oversee, evaluate                and replace the independent registered public accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● review and approve the scope of the annual internal and external audits;  
● review and pre-approve the engagement of Keysight's independent registered public accounting                firm to perform audit and non-audit services and the related fees;  
● meet independently with Keysight's internal auditing staff, independent registered public                accounting firm and senior management;  
● review the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial                reporting and any significant changes in internal control over financial reporting;  
● review Keysight's consolidated financial statements and disclosures including "Management's                Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's reports on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q;  
● establish and oversee procedures for (a) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints                received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and (b) the confidential anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters;  
[END TABLE]

● review disclosures from Keysight's independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable                requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independence of accountant's communications with the Audit and Finance Committee.  
[END TABLE]
In accordance with section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board has identified Charles J. Dockendorff as the Audit and Finance Committee's "Financial     Expert."
Compensation       Committee
The Compensation Committee is responsible for compensation of Keysight's CEO and other executive officers as well as Keysight's compensation plans, policies and     programs as they affect the CEO and other executive officers. In addition, the Compensation Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● determines the compensation and the corporate goals and objectives of the performance of the                CEO and other executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviews and evaluates the performance of the CEO and other executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● supervises and oversees the administration of Keysight's incentive compensation, variable pay                and stock programs and arrangements, including the impact of such programs and arrangements on Company risk;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● establishes comparator peer group and compensation targets based on this peer group for the                Company's named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● review and assess, on an annual basis, the impact of the Company's compensation programs and                arrangements on Company risk; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● has sole authority to retain and terminate executive compensation consultants.  
[END TABLE]
For more information on the responsibilities and activities of the Compensation Committee, including the Committee's processes for determining executive     compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," "Compensation Committee Report," "Executive Compensation," and the Compensation Committee's charter.
The Compensation Committee is aided by an independent consultant, currently Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("F. W. Cook"), who is selected and retained by the     Compensation Committee. The role of F. W. Cook is to advise the Committee on marketplace trends in executive compensation, management proposals for compensation programs, and executive officer compensation decisions. F. W. Cook also evaluates     compensation for non-employee directors and equity compensation programs generally. The firm consults with the Committee about its recommendations to the Board on chief executive officer compensation. To maintain the independence of the firm's advice,     F. W. Cook does not provide any services for Keysight other than those described above. These standards require that the Committee annually assess the independence of its compensation consultant. In assessing the consultant's independence, the     Compensation Committee considers all factors relevant to that person's independence from management, including the rules of the NYSE. F. W. Cook annually prepares for the Committee an independence letter providing assurances and confirmation of the     consultant's independent status under the standards. The Committee believes that F. W. Cook has been independent during its service for the Compensation Committee.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee proposes a slate of directors for election by Keysight's stockholders at each annual meeting and recommends to     the Board candidates to fill any vacancies on the Board. It is also responsible for reviewing management succession plans, recommending to the Board the appropriate Board size and Committee structure and developing and reviewing corporate governance     principles applicable to Keysight.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended for nomination by stockholders, provided that the recommendations     are made in accordance with the procedures described in the section entitled "General Information about the Meeting" located at the end of this Proxy Statement. Candidates recommended for nomination by stockholders that comply with these procedures     will receive the same consideration as other candidates recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Keysight typically hires a third-party executive search firm to help identify and facilitate the screening and interview process for director candidates. To be     considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a director nominee must have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a reputation for personal and professional integrity and ethics;

In addition to these minimum requirements, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider whether the candidate's skills are complementary to     the existing Board members' skills; the diversity of the Board in factors such as age, race, gender, experience in technology, manufacturing, finance and marketing, international experience and culture; and the Board's needs for specific operational,     management or other expertise. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee from time to time reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members, including factors that it seeks in Board members such as diversity of     business experience, viewpoints and, personal background, and diversity of skills in technology, finance, marketing, international business, financial reporting and other areas that are expected to contribute to an effective Board. In evaluating     potential candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers these factors in the light of the specific needs of the Board at that time. The executive search firm screens the candidates, does reference checks,     prepares a biography for each candidate for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to review and helps set up interviews. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Keysight's Chief Executive Officer interview candidates that meet     the criteria, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects candidates that best suit the Board's needs. We do not use a third party to evaluate current Board members.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also administers Keysight's Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures. See "Related Person Transactions     Policy and Procedures" for more information.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee meets or takes written action when the Board is not otherwise meeting. The Committee has full authority to act on behalf of the Board,     except that it cannot amend Keysight's Bylaws, recommend any action that requires the approval of the stockholders, fill vacancies on the Board or any Board Committee, fix director compensation, amend or repeal any non-amendable or non-repealable     resolution of the Board, declare a distribution to the stockholders except at rates determined by the Board, appoint other Committees or take any action not permitted under Delaware law to be delegated to a committee.
During fiscal year 2018, the Executive Committee did not hold any meetings.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND       INSIDER PARTICIPATION
The members of the Compensation Committee are set forth in the table on page 12. No member of the Compensation Committee was at any time during fiscal 2018 or at     any other time an officer or employee of Keysight, and no member of this committee had any relationship with Keysight requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. No executive officer of Keysight has served on the board of directors or     compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018.
Each of the members of the Compensation Committee is considered independent under the Company's Board and Compensation Committee Independence Standards as set     forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Guidelines.
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS POLICY AND       PROCEDURES
The Company's Standards of Business Conduct and Director Code of Ethics require that all employees and directors avoid conflicts of interests that interfere with     the performance of their duties or the best interests of the Company. In addition, the Company has adopted a written Related Person Transactions Policy and Procedures (the "Related Person Transactions Policy") that prohibits any of the Company's     executive officers, directors or any of their immediate family members from entering into a transaction with the Company, except in accordance with the policy. For purposes of the policy, a "related person transaction" includes any transaction (within     the meaning of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K) involving the Company and any related person that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Under our Related Person Transactions Policy, the General Counsel must advise the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of any related person transaction     of which he becomes aware. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must then either approve or reject the transaction in accordance with the terms of the policy. In the course of making this determination, the Nominating and Corporate     Governance Committee shall consider all relevant information available to it and, as appropriate, must take into consideration the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the size of the transaction and the amount payable to the related person;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the nature of the interest of the related person in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● whether the transaction may involve a conflict of interest; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● whether the transaction involved the provision of goods or services to the Company that are                available from unaffiliated third parties and, if so, whether the transaction is on terms and made under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the Company as would be available in comparable transactions with or involving                unaffiliated third parties.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Related Person Transactions Policy, Company management screens for any potential related person transactions, primarily through the annual circulation of     a Directors and Officers Questionnaire ("D&O Questionnaire") to each member of the Board and each officer of the Company that is a reporting person under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The     D&O Questionnaire contains questions intended to identify related persons and transactions between the Company and related persons. If a related person transaction is identified, such transaction is brought to the attention of the Nominating and     Corporate Governance Committee for its approval, ratification, revision, or rejection in consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must approve or ratify each related person transaction in accordance with the policy. Absent this approval or     ratification, no such transaction may be entered into by the Company with any related person.
In 2014, the Board adopted the Related Person Transactions Policy to provide for standing pre-approval of limited transactions with related persons. Pre-approved     transactions include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any transaction with another company at which a related person's only relationship is as an                employee (other than an executive officer or an equivalent), director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company's shares, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of (i) $1,000,000, or (ii) 2% of that company's                total annual revenues.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any charitable contribution, grant or endowment by the Company to a charitable organization,                foundation or university at which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer or an equivalent), a director or a trustee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the lesser of $500,000, or                2% of the charitable organization's total annual receipts.  
[END TABLE]
Keysight will disclose the terms of related person transactions in its filings with the SEC to the extent required.
Transactions with Related Persons
We purchase services, supplies, and equipment in the normal course of business from many suppliers and sell or lease products and services to many customers. In     some instances, these transactions occur with companies with which members of our management or Board have relationships as directors or executive officers. For transactions entered into during fiscal year 2018, none              exceeded or fell outside of the pre-approved thresholds set forth in our Related Party Transaction Policy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● BlackRock, Inc. holds 8.3% of Keysight's total outstanding equity pursuant to information contained in a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on January 25, 2018. During fiscal            year 2018, Keysight purchased from BlackRock Advisors (UK) Ltd., a subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. approximately $290,000 of products and/or services. The transactions with BlackRock Advisors (UK) Ltd. fell within Keysight's pre-approved            transactions.

[END TABLE]
Fees Paid       to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered to Keysight by PwC for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. 
Audit Fees: Consists of fees billed for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of Keysight's consolidated financial statements and its     internal control over financial reporting and review of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports. Fees for fiscal 2018 and 2017 also consist of fees billed for services that are normally provided by PwC in     connection with statutory reporting and regulatory filings or engagements, and attest services, except those not required by statute or regulation.
Audit-Related Fees: Consists of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of     Keysight's consolidated financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include accounting consultations in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, attest services that are not required by statute or regulation, and     consultations concerning financial accounting.
Tax Fees: Consists of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These services include assistance regarding     federal, state and international tax compliance, tax audits and appeals, customs and duties, mergers and acquisitions and international tax planning.
All Other Fees: Consists of fees for all other services other than those reported above. These services include a license for specialized accounting     research software. Keysight's intent is to minimize services in this category.
In making its recommendation to ratify the appointment of PwC as Keysight's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31,     2019, the Audit and Finance Committee has considered whether services other than audit and audit-related services provided by PwC are compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC.
Policy on Audit and Finance Committee Preapproval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent       Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit and Finance Committee's policy is to preapprove all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting     firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Preapproval is generally provided for up to one year and any preapproval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is     subject to a specific budget.
The Audit and Finance Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any     other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the Audit and Finance Committee Report by reference therein.
December 13, 2018
The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board reviewed the quality and integrity of Keysight's consolidated financial statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report     on Form 10-K, its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of its independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of its internal audit function and independent registered public accounting     firm and other significant financial matters. Each of the Audit and Finance Committee members satisfies the definition of independent director and is financially literate as established in the New York Stock Exchange Listing Standards. In accordance     with section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board has identified Charles J. Dockendorff as the Audit and Finance Committee's "Financial Expert." Keysight operates with a November 1 to October 31 fiscal year. The Audit and Finance Committee     met eleven times during the 2018 fiscal year.
The Audit and Finance Committee's work is guided by a written charter that the Board has approved. The Audit and Finance Committee regularly reviews its charter to     ensure that it is meeting all relevant audit committee policy requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the New York Stock Exchange. You can access the latest Audit and Finance     Committee charter by clicking on "Governance Policies" in the "Corporate Governance" section of the web page at www.investor.keysight.com or by writing to us at Keysight Technologies, Inc., 1400 Fountaingrove Parkway, Santa Rosa, California     95403, Attention: Investor Relations.
The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Keysight's independent registered public accounting     firm, Keysight's audited consolidated financial statements and Keysight's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit and Finance Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on     Auditing Standards No. 1301 (Communication with Audit Committees).
The Audit and Finance Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the applicable     requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from     Keysight. Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that Keysight's audited consolidated financial statements be included in Keysight's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended     October 31, 2018, and be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section       16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires Keysight's directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of Keysight common stock to file reports with the     SEC regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of Keysight stock. Keysight believes that during the 2018 fiscal year, its executive officers, directors and holders of 10% or more of our common stock complied with all Section 16(a) filing     requirements.
In making these statements, Keysight has relied upon examination of copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 provided to Keysight and the written representations of its     directors and officers.
COMPENSATION OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
Director Compensation Highlights
Keysight's director compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors and to address the time, effort, expertise, and     accountability required of active board membership. Our Compensation Committee believes that annual compensation for non-employee directors should consist of both cash to compensate members for their services on the Board of Directors and its     committees, and equity to align the interest of directors and stockholders. The non-employee director's compensation plan year begins on March 1st and ends on the end of February of the following calendar year (the "Plan Year").
Decisions regarding our non-employee director compensation program are approved by the full Board based on recommendations by the Compensation Committee. In making     such recommendations, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration the director compensation practices of peer companies and whether such recommendation aligns with the interests of our stockholders. Like compensation for our executive officers,     the Compensation Committee reviews the total compensation of our non-employee directors and each element of our director compensation program annually. At the direction of the Compensation Committee, F.W. Cook, the Compensation Committee's independent     consultant, annually analyzes the competitive position of the Company's director compensation program against the peer group used for executive compensation purposes (see pages 29-31 for more information about the peer group).
F.W. Cook's analysis in September 2017 showed that compensation for non-employee directors had not changed since Keysight's inception, was near the peer group     median, and peer director compensation has increased about 5% per year since 2015. As a result, our Compensation Committee recommended, and our Board of Directors approved, the following changes to our director compensation program for fiscal year 2018     to better reflect market practice and to appropriately compensate our non-employee directors for their time, commitment and contributions to the Board: (1) an increase in annual non-employee director cash compensation from $90,000 to $100,000; (2) an     increase in the annual non-employee equity grant from $180,000 to $200,000; (3) an increase in Committee Chair premiums from $15,000 per Committee to $30,000 for the Audit and Finance Committee Chair and $20,000 for the Compensation Committee Chair.     The additional Chairman of the Board retainer, the Audit and Finance Committee member retainers, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair premium remained unchanged.
The compensation to our non-employee directors is set forth below:
Summary       of Non-Employee Director Annual Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   Each non-employee director or chairman may elect to defer all or part of the cash compensation to the Deferred Compensation              Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Any deferred cash compensation is converted into shares of Keysight common stock. In the event that a director does not serve for the entire year, the cash retainer will be pro-rated.

Non-Employee              Director Compensation Earned During Fiscal Year 2018
The table below sets forth information regarding the regular compensation earned by each of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended October 31,     2018:
Non-Employee              Director Reimbursement Practice for Fiscal Year 2018
Non-employee directors are reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses in connection with attendance at Board of Directors and committee meetings.
Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit
In addition, in March 2018, our stockholders approved a limit on the total value of cash and equity compensation that may be paid or granted to a non-employee     director during each fiscal year. Currently, the maximum amount of total compensation payable to a non-employee director for services in a fiscal year of the Company may not exceed $750,000, calculated as the sum of (a) the grant date fair value     (determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718) of all awards payable in shares and the maximum amount payable pursuant to cash-based awards that may be granted under the 2014 Equity     Plan, plus (b) cash compensation in the form of Board and committee retainers and meeting or similar fees. Compensation counts towards this limit for the fiscal year in which it is granted or earned by a non-employee director, and not later when     distributed, in the event it is deferred.
Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
In 2014, the Company adopted the guidelines to require each non-employee director to own Keysight shares having a value of at least five times the director's     annual board cash retainer (currently $100,000), based on the recommendation of the Committee's independent compensation consultant, F.W. Cook. The shares counted toward the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright and the shares of Keysight     stock in the non-employee director's deferred compensation account. These ownership levels must be attained within five years from the date of their initial election or appointment to the Board. As of October 31, 2018, each of our incumbent non-employee directors have achieved at least the recommended ownership level.
PROPOSAL 3—NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF KEYSIGHT'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the stockholders of Keysight are entitled to cast an advisory vote at the Annual Meeting to approve the compensation     of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. The stockholder vote is an annual advisory vote only and is not binding on Keysight or its Board. Although the vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the     Board value your opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote in establishing Keysight's compensation philosophy and making future compensation decisions. It is expected that the next such advisory vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting.
As described more fully in the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" on pages 27 to 42 and in the Summary Compensation Table and subsequent tables on pages 43     to 58, the Company's named executive officers, as identified on page 28 are compensated in a manner consistent with our business strategy, competitive practice, sound compensation governance principles, and stockholder interests and concerns. We     structure our compensation to support our business objectives with appropriate rewards for short-term operating results and long-term stockholder value creation.
In fiscal year 2018, we saw the benefit of our industry-focused strategy and deliberate investment in key market growth themes and opportunities. As demand for our     solutions accelerated, we achieved double-digit revenue growth for the full year across nearly all our end markets.  In addition to driving revenue growth, we increased profitability and cash flow through both margin expansion and continued operational     discipline. 
For fiscal year 2018:

Keysight also maintains several compensation governance programs in place as described on pages 29, and 39 to 40 to manage compensation risk and align Keysight's     executive compensation with long-term stockholder interests. These programs include:
We are requesting your non-binding vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described on pages 28 to 58, including the Summary     Compensation Table and subsequent tables on pages 43 to 58 of the proxy statement.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Keysight common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, together with the     affirmative vote of a majority of the required quorum, is required for approval of this proposal. If you own shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record, you must instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record how to vote in order for     them to vote your shares so that your vote can be counted on this proposal.
COMPENSATION                DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Summary
Keysight Technologies, Inc. is a measurement company providing electronic design and test solutions to communications and electronics industries. We provide     services and deliver solutions that allow customers to bring breakthrough electronic products to market faster and at lower cost in more than 100 countries. We create customer satisfaction and earn customer loyalty by providing products and services of     the highest quality and greatest value.
In fiscal year 2018, we continued to position Keysight for future growth. We are executing on our strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders by     building on our heritage, partnering with customers early to create new opportunities, and driving growth across multiple avenues of emerging technology trends. Our continued focus and commitment led to strong results for the year.
Fiscal Year 2018 Business Highlights
In fiscal year 2018, we saw the benefit of our industry-focused strategy and deliberate investment in key market growth themes and opportunities, such as 5G,     automotive, software, aerospace/defense and services.  As demand for our solutions accelerated, we achieved double-digit revenue growth for the full year across nearly all our end markets, including Communications, Aerospace/Defense, Electronic     Industrials and Services.  In addition to driving revenue growth, we increased profitability and cash flow through both margin expansion and continued operational discipline. 
Non-GAAP revenue ("Non-GAAP Revenue") growth, non-GAAP operating margin ("Non-GAAP OM") and non-GAAP earnings per share ("Non-GAAP EPS") are key financial metrics     for measuring Keysight's financial success and are tied directly to our short and long-term incentive compensation. In fiscal year 2018, we achieved total Non-GAAP Revenue growth of 20% vs. our incentive plan target of 12%.  Through the sound financial     and operational discipline of the Keysight Leadership Model (KLM) we generated non-GAAP OM of 20% compared to our incentive plan target of 20%, a year-over-year increase of 5%.  Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal year 2018 was $3.24, compared to our incentive     plan target of $2.78, and grew 28% year-over-year. 
Our strong execution and financial performance also resulted in a 28% appreciation in Keysight's share price over the past year, increasing from $44.67 per share     on October 31, 2017, to $57.08 per share on October 31, 2018.  This share price appreciation outpaced our compensation peer group, resulting in a 200% payout under our long-term incentive plan program for the three-year performance period from FY16-18.
We are pleased with our fiscal year 2018 accomplishments.  Our strategic execution and transformation for growth is delivering results and building momentum.      Keysight is at the heart of the smart technology revolution.  We are committed to helping our customers accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, while continuing to create long-term value for stockholders and our employees. 
Results of 2017 Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
Our executive compensation program is well aligned with the interests of our stockholders and is instrumental to achieving our business strategy. In setting     executive compensation for fiscal year 2018, which was completed in November 2017, the Compensation Committee considered the stockholder support (94% approval of votes cast) that our "Say-on-Pay" proposal received at its March 16, 2017 Annual Meeting     of Stockholders.
During the last Annual Stockholders' Meeting on March 22, 2018, our "Say-on-Pay" proposal received 96% approval of votes cast, which was taken into consideration     by the Compensation Committee in determining our executive compensation for fiscal year 2019. The high approval percentage shows that our stockholders agree with our compensation philosophy and programs.
The Compensation Committee believes that the results of each vote confirm the philosophy and objective of linking our executive compensation to our operating     objectives and the enhancement of stockholder value. As a result, following each vote, the Committee retained its general program approach to executive compensation and continued to apply the same general principles and philosophy as in prior fiscal     years in determining the compensation of our executives.
Named Executive Officers
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we discuss our compensation philosophy and executive compensation program, as well as describe and analyze the compensation actions and     decisions for our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs"). For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, our NEOs and their designated titles are as follows:
Pay for Performance Alignment
Our executive compensation program is designed to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. For this reason, a     significant portion of our executive officers' target total direct compensation is variable in nature and at risk and is subject to company performance measured against certain financial objectives, including Non-GAAP EPS, Non-GAAP Revenue, Non-GAAP     OM, and relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR").
Short-Term Incentives
For fiscal year 2018, our Performance-Based Compensation Plan was based on the achievement of pre-established semi-annual financial objectives. These awards were     paid in cash and designed to reward achievement of critical short-term financial goals. The financial objectives are described in more detail beginning on page 32.
Short-Term       Performance Incentive Results:

   First Half Fiscal Year 2018 Achievement Percent of Target   Second Half Fiscal Year 2018 Achievement Percent of Target  
[END TABLE]
These results, combined with an evaluation of individual performance, determined the annual short-term incentive payout for the majority of our executive officers,     including the NEOs. For fiscal year 2018, the annual incentive payouts for our NEOs ranged from 0% to 150% of their target award opportunities.
Long-Term Incentives
In fiscal year 2018, the awards for our executive officers under our Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTI") consist of performance stock units ("PSUs") under our     Long-Term Performance Program ("LTP Program") and restricted stock units ("RSUs"). PSUs are linked to achievement of pre-established objective performance thresholds while RSUs are time-based and vest annually over four years. The PSUs settle at the     end of a three-year performance period and are granted to reward multi-year stockholder value creation through the performance of our stock as measured against the relative TSR of our peers and through improving profitability as measured by Non-GAAP     OM, both important indicators of our success. The combination of relative TSR and Non-GAAP OM provide a more comprehensive measure of our success relative to our peers and greater returns for our stockholders.
Compensation Policies and Practices
Our executive compensation and corporate governance program are designed to link pay with operational performance and increase in long-term stockholder value while     striking a responsible balance between risk and reward. To accomplish these objectives, we have adopted the following policies and practices over time:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● No provision for payment of dividend equivalents on unvested awards  
[END TABLE]
Process for Determining Executive Compensation
Each November, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of F.W. Cook and our management team, determines the target total direct compensation opportunities     for all of our executive officers, including our NEOs, based on a thorough review of their individual performance and the following additional factors (collectively, "Compensation Factors"):
The CEO and the Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, do not provide recommendations to the Compensation Committee for his/her own compensation. Our     CEO's target total direct compensation opportunity is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, which then presents its recommendation to the independent members of our Board of Directors for discussion. The Compensation Committee then makes the     final determination on the target total direct compensation for our CEO.
Keysight's Peer Groups
As part of its compensation deliberations, the Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of the compensation practices of the competitive market using one     or more groups of peer companies. The Compensation Committee annually reviews our peer groups to ensure the companies are suitable peers for compensation comparison purposes. In fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of F.W.     Cook, approved a compensation peer group for consideration for fiscal year 2018 compensation decisions based on the following criteria:
To reflect our growth in software solutions, Systems Software was added as a sub-industry. These criteria resulted in the selection of 33 companies, all members of     the Russell 3000 Information Sector, including four new companies. The selected companies compete with us either in the same business and capital markets or in the executive talent arena or similarly operate complex business operations with significant     global reach. The Compensation Committee used compensation data drawn from the compensation peer group as one of the Compensation Factors that were considered in setting the compensation of the executive officers.
* Companies added to the fiscal year 2018 compensation peer group based on the selection criteria
Competitive              Positioning to Peer Group
At the time of its approval, we were approximately at the median of our compensation peer group based on revenue, market capitalization, and number of employees.

[END TABLE]
Peer Group for       the Long-Term Incentives Program
The Compensation Committee believes that a larger peer group is more appropriate for evaluating TSR performance under the Keysight's LTP Program, as a larger peer     group provides a broader index for comparison and better alignment with stockholder investment choices. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee selected the S&P 400 Index for determining relative TSR as one of the performance criteria for LTP     Program awards granted for the three-year performance period ending October 31, 2020. This index has a strong correlation with Keysight's stock price. The S&P 400 constituent list is maintained by the S&P Index Committee, which is available at     www.standardandpoors.com/indices/main/en/us. Any change in the expanded peer group is solely due to Standard & Poor's criteria for inclusion in the index.
Elements of 2018 Compensation
This section describes the elements of our executive officers, including NEOs, for fiscal year 2018 compensation, which consists of the following:
In fiscal year 2018, approximately 70% of our CEO's and about 57% on average of our NEO's target total direct compensation consisted of long-term incentives and     was "at-risk" – which means that the component would vary year to year depending on our stock price and TSR against the S&P 400 and our Non-GAAP OM.
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews base salaries for our executive officers, if needed, to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors,     including changing responsibilities as our executive officers' positions evolve. Base salaries are set at levels intended to be competitive and commensurate with each executive officer's position, performance, skills and experience in order to attract     and retain the best talent.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES  | 32  
[END TABLE]
The base salaries of our NEOs are set annually by the Compensation Committee, who considers the Compensation Factors for each NEO and the Company's expected     operating budget. Base salary is a fixed component of our NEOs' compensation and does not vary with Company performance. The Compensation Committee approved the following adjustments to base salaries, effective December 1, 2017 based on the factors     described above:
(1)       Mr. Gooi is paid in Malaysian Ringgit, and his 2018 base salary was     converted to US dollars based on the currency exchange rate as of October 31, 2018.
Short-Term Incentives
The Performance-Based Compensation Plan for our NEOs and others in executive and senior manager roles provides cash awards every six months depending on Company     performance. The awards are directly linked to the achievement of semi-annual financial objectives established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each performance period, based on the financial plan approved by the Board for that year.     Semi-annual financial objectives are chosen instead of annual objectives to account for the cyclical nature and volatility of our markets. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the short-term incentive plan threshold and maximum     tied to each objective, benchmarking our internal historical achievement against external market data to ensure alignment with the market and the compensation practices. The short-term cash incentives are tied to the financial objectives with each     objective weighted depending on the executive's role and responsibilities. Depending upon Company's performance, the payout ranges from 0% to 200% of target. The Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion to determine the final award     payout.
At the end of each performance period, the Compensation Committee certifies our actual performance against the objectives and to the extent earned, the cash     incentive awards are paid. Performance measures and target performance goals cannot be changed after they are established by the Compensation Committee.
Financial Objectives for Fiscal Year 2018
For fiscal year 2018, we retained Non-GAAP EPS as one of the financial objectives for the short-term cash incentives of our NEOs for the following reasons:
The Compensation Committee believes that Non-GAAP EPS is a transparent, operations-based measure, which is computed on the basis of Non-GAAP earnings and diluted     shares. Non-GAAP earnings are calculated by excluding the impact of share-based compensation, restructuring costs, separation costs, transformational costs, acquisition and integration costs, asset impairments and non-cash intangible amortization. We     also exclude any tax benefits or expenses that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or which could not be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Non-GAAP EPS is the same metric that we use     for our quarterly earnings announcements.
Non-GAAP EPS targets are determined by our semi-annual financial planning process. Management prepares a financial plan which is then reviewed and approved by the     Board of Directors. The Non-GAAP targets are directly tied to the approved financial plan and do not change during the performance period. The threshold and maximum are designed to account for the cyclical nature and volatility of our markets. Diluted     shares are defined as the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion are exercised.
Last year, the Compensation Committee added a second financial objective for the short-term cash incentives of our NEOs in the form of Non-GAAP Revenue growth. For     segment presidents, revenue growth is tied solely to their respective business groups and for other NEOs, revenue growth is measured on Keysight's total revenues. Aligning compensation incentives to the revenue growth of specific business groups     creates direct accountability for our executives. Non-GAAP Revenue growth is based on reported Non-GAAP Revenue, which is Keysight's GAAP reported revenue but includes recognition of acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in     purchase accounting and excludes incremental revenue from acquisitions completed within the applicable period.

Short-Term Cash       Incentive Awards Calculations and Awards Measures
For fiscal year 2018, the award payouts under the Performance-Based Compensation Plan for the NEOs were calculated by multiplying the individual's base salary for the performance     period by the individual target award, financial target award, and attainment percentage.
Financial Objectives
The following tables describe the threshold, target and maximum financial measures for the financial objectives of Non-GAAP EPS, Keysight Non-GAAP Revenue growth, and EISG Non-GAAP     Revenue growth, as well as reports the actual results and attainment percentage. Based on the attainment percentage, payouts could have ranged from 0% to 200%.

Long-Term Incentives
2018 Long-Term       Incentive Award Mix
The mix of long-term incentive awards for our NEOs, 60% delivered in performance-based equity and 40% delivered in time-vested shares places a greater emphasis on     at-risk compensation and therefore aligns NEOs compensation with long-term stockholder value. The mix is represented in the following chart.
PSU Performance       Measure
The Compensation Committee has established rolling three-year performance periods for PSU awards under our LTP Program and for fiscal year 2018 used TSR and     Non-GAAP OM, as the performance measures for the performance period ending October 31, 2020, with a portion of each NEO's PSUs earned based on the attainment of each performance measure. The target number of PSUs subject to each performance measure was     approximately equal to 50% of the grant date value of each NEO's PSUs since Keysight considers TSR and Non-GAAP OM to be equally important for long-term performance by balancing internal operational goals with market performance.
TSR reflects (1) the aggregate change in the 90-day average closing price of our stock versus the S&P 400 Total Return Index. The beginning average is the     90-day period prior to the performance period and the ending average will be the final 90-day period of the performance period, and (2) per S&P's methodology, the price of this index reflects reinvestment of dividends into the entire index on the     ex-dividend date and also includes adjustments based on their proprietary formula (which includes additions/deletions to index, rights issues, share buybacks/issuances, and spin-offs).
The Non-GAAP OM performance measure is set at the beginning of each fiscal year and following the completion of the applicable fiscal year, the Non-GAAP OM payout     percentage achievement is calculated for such fiscal year. Following the completion of the three-year performance period, the Non-GAAP OM payout percentage achievement for each fiscal year is then averaged and used to determine the total number of PSUs     that are earned based on Non-GAAP OM. For fiscal 2018, Non-GAAP OM excludes, among other things, the impacts of share-based compensation, restructuring and related costs, separation and related costs, acquisition and integration costs, amortization of     acquisition-related balances, acquisition-related compensation expense, pension curtailment and settlement gains. Because the Non-GAAP OM target is set at the beginning of each fiscal year, income and expenses related to an acquisition are excluded for     the fiscal year in which the acquisition occurs but are included in both target and actual results in subsequent years.

Long-Term       Incentives Granted in Fiscal Year 2018
The target value of the long-term incentive awards granted is determined by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the then-current fiscal year for each of     our NEOs after considering the Compensation Factors. Grant values were determined as follows:
The following table shows the long-term incentive awards granted in fiscal year 2018 to the NEOs.

Performance       Stock Units Granted in Fiscal Year 2018
The TSR PSUs granted in fiscal year 2018 will be measured and paid out based on TSR for the fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2020 performance period. The OM     PSUs will be measured and paid out based on Non-GAAP OM for the fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2020 performance period. The PSUs are wholly "at risk" compensation as our performance must be at or above the threshold of the TSR and Non-GAAP OM, as     applicable, for the award recipients to earn any of the shares of our common stock subject to their PSUs.
PSUs Based on       TSR
With respect to the TSR PSUs, last year the Compensation Committee changed the TSR methodology from TSR percentile ranking among selected companies to a relative     performance versus the S&P 400 total return index to better represent the Company's performance versus alternative investment opportunities. Unlike TSR percentile ranking, relative performance is measured as the difference in basis points between     Keysight's TSR and the S&P 400 total return index.
The Compensation Committee did not establish an absolute TSR target as it believed that performance would be best measured on a relative basis against the S&P     400 total return index. The payout matrix determined by the Compensation Committee for TSR was:
The PSUs will be settled linearly for each level of performance as illustrated below:
Performance Share Payout Schedule (TSR)
PSUs Based on Non-GAAP         OM
Non-GAAP OM is an internal financial metric that complements the external market-conditioned metric, TSR. Having an       internal financial objective linked directly our long- term incentive program creates more accountability and line of sight to our financial plan which focuses on our internal growth and profitability metrics.
The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum Non-GAAP OM goals for fiscal 2018 and the actual       results for fiscal 2018.

Fiscal Year 2016 - 2018 LTP         Program Payout
In fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee granted our NEOs long-term incentive awards in the form of PSUs that       would be earned, if at all, based on Keysight's TSR ranking relative to the companies in the S&P 500 IT & Industrials Sectors Index for the performance period that began on November 1, 2015 and concluded on October 31, 2018 as set forth in       the table below:
On November 14, 2018, the Keysight Compensation Committee certified that Keysight's TSR ranking relative to the       companies in the S&P 500 IT & Industrials Sectors Index was equal to the 75th percentile and accordingly approved a payout at 200% of target for the performance       period. The payout of these awards was made in November 2018, with the payouts to our NEOs shown below.
The following table sets forth the targeted number of         shares for the performance period covering fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2018, the shares earned at 200% of target and the cash value of the earned shares.
Policies for Compensation Risk Mitigation
Recoupment Policy
Our Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy applies to all executive officers that are subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act. Under this Policy,       in the event of (A) a material restatement of financial results (wherein results were incorrect at the time published due to mistake, fraud or other misconduct), or (B) fraud or misconduct by an executive officer, the Compensation Committee will, in       the case of a restatement, review all short-term and long-term incentive compensation awards that were paid or awarded to the executive officers for performance periods beginning after October 31, 2014 that occurred, in whole or in part, during the       restatement period. In the case of fraud or misconduct, the Compensation Committee will consider actions to remedy the fraud or misconduct, prevent its recurrence, and impose discipline on the wrongdoers, in each case, as it deems appropriate.
These actions may include, without limitation and to the extent permitted by governing law, requiring reimbursement of compensation, causing the cancellation of       outstanding PSUs, RSUs, stock options, and other equity incentive awards, limiting future awards or compensation, and requiring the disgorgement of profits realized from the sale of shares of our common stock to the extent such profit was, in part or       in whole, the result of the fraud or misconduct.
The Compensation Committee will amend the Policy, as necessary, to comply with the final SEC rules regarding the recoupment policy required by the Dodd-Frank       Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Hedging and         Insider Trading Policy
Our Insider Trading Policy expressly bars ownership of financial instruments or participation in investment strategies that hedge the economic risk of owning our       equity securities. We also prohibit our executive officers and the members of our Board from pledging our equity securities as collateral for loans. In addition, we prohibit our executive officers, directors and employees from purchasing or selling       our securities while in possession of material, non-public information, or otherwise using such information for their personal benefit and maintain a quarterly black-out window where applicable individuals may not trade.
Our executive officers and members of our Board are permitted to enter into trading plans that are intended to comply with the requirements of Exchange Act Rule       10b5-1 so they may make predetermined trades of Keysight stock or exercise stock options.
Indemnification         Agreements
These agreements indemnify our executive officers and the members of our Board of Directors, as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities       at our request, against expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to us and our subsidiaries.
A Culture of         Ownership
Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to encourage our executive officers, including our NEOs, to achieve and       maintain a significant equity stake in the Company and closely align their interests with those of our stockholders. The guidelines provide that our CEO should accumulate and hold, within five years from election to his position, an investment level       in our common stock equal to six times his annual base salary. The guidelines further provide that our CFO, COO, and other executive officers should accumulate and hold, within five years from appointment to their respective executive officer       positions, an investment level in our common stock equal to the lesser of either (1) three times their annual base salary or (2) direct ownership of a certain level of shares of our common stock (40,000 or 80,000 shares).       
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review to assess compliance with the guidelines. As of the end of       fiscal year 2018, each of our NEOs met his stock ownership guideline requirement.
Compensation Risk Assessment
F.W. Cook conducts an annual review of our compensation related risks. The risk assessment conducted during fiscal       year 2018 concluded that our executive compensation program is well designed to encourage behaviors aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. F.W. Cook also found an appropriate balance in fixed versus variable pay, cash and equity,       and appropriate mix of financial metrics. Finally, it was determined that there are appropriate policies in place to mitigate compensation-related risk, including stock ownership guidelines, insider-trading prohibitions, the Executive Compensation       Recoupment Policy, and independent Compensation Committee oversight of our executive compensation programs.
Other Compensation Practices and Policies
Benefits and Limited Perquisites
Our global benefits philosophy is to provide our executive officers, including our NEOs, with protection and       security through health and welfare, retirement, and life insurance programs.
In addition to these Company-wide benefits, our NEOs are offered Company-paid financial counseling through a       third-party service to assist with their personal finances. Providing this service gives our NEOs a better understanding of their compensation and benefits, allowing them to concentrate on their responsibilities and our future success. Our executive       officers, including our NEOs, are also offered physical examinations, for which we cover the costs that are not otherwise covered under each of our NEOs' chosen health plan. We believe that the executive physical is a prudent measure to help ensure       the health of our executive officers. Both the financial counseling and the executive physicals are benefits that are generally provided by our peers and are available to us at a reasonable group cost.
In connection with Mr. Gooi's relocation from Malaysia to Singapore due to his main office change, Mr. Gooi       received Company paid relocation services and tax restoration on his relocation benefits, all in accordance with the Company's standard relocation policy. Our executive officers also had access to Company drivers to transport them and their families       to the airport for personal travel, as do other Company executives.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Our NEOs are eligible to voluntarily defer base salary, short-term cash incentives, and performance shares earned       under the LTP Program. The deferrals are made through the Keysight Technologies, Inc. 2014 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan").
Deferred compensation is distributed to eligible participants in January of the year following termination of their       employment, if termination occurs during the first six months of the calendar year. Otherwise, payouts are distributed to participants in July of the year following termination of employment. No early distributions or withdrawals are allowed. If an       election is made to defer performance shares earned under the LTP Program, shares are deferred and released to the participants as indicated above.
The specific benefits and an additional description of plan features are set forth in the section entitled       "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation in Last Fiscal Year" below.
Defined Contribution and Pension Plans
The Keysight Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), the Keysight Technologies, Inc.       Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan (the "Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan), the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the "Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan") and the Keysight Technologies, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan")       are designed for long-term employment retention as well as to support the career-employment strategy and to provide employee retirement savings.       
Additional information on the pension benefits for which certain of the NEOs are eligible is set forth in the "Fiscal Year 2018 Pension Benefits Table."
In addition, all employees in Malaysia participate in the government mandatory retirement plan, managed by the Employer Provident Fund (EPF), a government       agency.  This plan requires contribution from both the employer and the employee. We contribute a fixed contribution rate of 12%.  Mr. Gooi participates in this plan with an 11% contribution rate. Employees can also opt to contribute at a lower rate       of 9%.  In addition, Mr. Gooi also participates in a Company-wide EPF Top-up plan, for which we contribute 3% of monthly base earning.  No employee contributions are accepted for this plan.
Policy Regarding         Deduction Limit
Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)") places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct as a business expense in any year       with respect to certain of our most highly paid executive officers. Historically there has been an exemption from this $1 million deduction limit for compensation payments that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m). Generally, in the       past we have designed our executive compensation program to permit the Compensation Committee to award compensation intended to be eligible for deductibility to the extent permitted by Section 162(m) and the relevant IRS regulations. With the       enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, the performance-based compensation exemption has been eliminated, except with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of       compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to maintain flexibility in our approach to executive compensation and to structure a program       that we consider to be the most effective in attracting, motivating and retaining key employees.
Accounting         Considerations
We follow Financial Accounting Standard Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or ASC Topic 718, for       our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is       performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their       stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.       
Termination –Severance Plan and Change of Control Agreements
Consistent with the practice of many of our peers, the Compensation Committee has adopted an Officer and Executive       Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") for our U.S. based officers and executives, which provide specified severance payments and benefits in cases where the officer is terminated other than for Cause, misconduct, death, or physical or mental       incapacity or resigns for Good Reason (each, as defined in the Severance Plan). A more detailed description of the Severance Plan is provided in the "Officer and Executive Severance Plan" section below.
In addition, we have entered into Change-of-Control Agreements ("Change of Control Agreement") with our officers       designed to provide protection to the officers so they are not distracted by their personal, professional and financial situations at a time when we need them to remain focused on their responsibilities, the Company's best interests and those of our       stockholders. These agreements provide for "double-trigger" payments and benefits, which means that they are eligible to receive such payments and benefits only in the event of a change in control of the Company and the officer is terminated other       than for Cause or resigns for Good Reason (each, as defined in the Change of Control Agreement) within a limited period of time after the change in control. Such benefits will not become payable unless both such events occur. A more detailed       description of the Change of Control Agreements with the NEOs is provided in the "Change of Control Severance Agreements" section below.
The potential payments that would be received by our NEOs under the Severance Plan and the Change-of-Control       Agreements are disclosed in the "Termination and Change of Control Table" below.

November 14, 2018
Our executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the       "Compensation Committee"). The Compensation Committee, which is composed entirely of independent, non-employee directors, is responsible for approving and reporting to our Board of Directors on all elements of compensation for our executive officers.       In this regard, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board       of Directors that the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FASB ASC Topic       718 Assumptions
The following table sets forth the weighted average FASB ASC Topic 718 assumptions used in the calculation of the stock awards and option awards presented in the     "Summary Compensation Table" and in the tables above. For all periods presented, the fair values of share-based awards for employee stock options were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, while awards granted under the LTP Program     were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. The estimated fair values of restricted stock unit awards were determined based on the closing price of Keysight's common stock on the date of grant. Prior to separation, the fair value of awards was     determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for expected dividend yield.

The following table sets forth information on stock option exercises and stock vesting in fiscal year 2018 and the value realized on the date of exercise or     vesting, if any, by each of our NEOs, as calculated, in the case of stock options, based on the difference between the market price of Keysight's common stock at exercise and the option exercise price, and as calculated, in the case of RSUs, based on     the closing share price of Keysight's common stock on the NYSE on the vesting date.
(1) Amounts reflect the performance shares granted in fiscal year 2016 pursuant to the LTI Program for the           fiscal year 2016-2018 performance period that were paid out in fiscal 2019 in addition to restricted stock units that vested during fiscal year 2018.
Pension       Benefits
The following table shows the estimated present value of accumulated benefits payable, including benefits payable on retirement to our NEOs under the Retirement     Plan, the Deferred Profit Sharing Plan, the Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan and the Excess Benefit Retirement Plan.
Years of Service and Years of Credited Service under the Retirement Plan includes Years of Service and Years of Credited Service under the Hewlett Packard     Retirement Plan and the Agilent Technologies, Inc. Retirement Plan. The present value of accumulated benefit is calculated using the assumptions under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715: Compensation—Retirement Benefits for the fiscal year end     measurement (as of October 31, 2018). The present value is based on a lump sum interest rate of 5.5%. See also Note 15 to Keysight's consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, as     filed with the SEC on December 18, 2018.

Retirement              Plan
The Retirement Plan provides minimum retirement benefits payable at the later of age 65 or termination. The benefits under the Retirement Plan is based on eligible     compensation and years of credited service with Keysight, Agilent (as applicable) and HP (as applicable). No more than 30 years of credited service is used in determining the benefits under the Retirement Plan.
For service beginning on or after November 1, 2009, benefits are determined using the "2009 Benefit Formula." For service on or before October 31, 2009, Retirement     Plan benefits are determined under the "1993 Benefit Formula."
The total benefits under the Retirement Plan is equal to the sum of the 2009 Benefit Formula benefits (if any) plus the 1993 Benefit Formula benefits (if any).
2009 Benefit Formula
Benefits are accrued on a monthly basis as a lump sum payable at normal retirement age based on target pay and years of credited service up to a maximum of     30 years as follows:
For participants who have fewer than 15 years of service:
[BEGIN TABLE]
11% × target pay at the end of the month  PLUS    5% × target pay at the end of the month in excess of 
50% of the Social Security Wage

[END TABLE]
For participants who have 15 or more years of service:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 50% of the Social Security Wage Base
14% × target pay at the end of the month  PLUS    5% × target pay at the end of the month in excess of 
 50% of the Social Security Wage Base
[END TABLE]
No more than 30 Years of Credited Service is taken into account for purposes of determining the total benefits under the Retirement Plan. If an employee has more     than 30 Years of Credited Service before they retire, the 2009 Benefit Formula benefits will be based on their highest consecutive annual 2009 Benefit Formula accruals during their career.
1993 Benefit Formula
Only employees who earned benefits under the Agilent Retirement Plan before November 1, 2009, have benefits under the 1993 Benefit Formula. Benefits under the 1993     Benefit Formula are calculated as of October 31, 2009 and are expressed as an annuity. The 1993 Benefit Formula was frozen meaning that there were no additional accruals under the 1993 Benefit Formula after October 31, 2009.
The 1993 Benefit Formula provides retirement benefits in the form of lifetime monthly payments beginning at age 65. These benefits are calculated using a formula     that is based on the participant's highest average pay rate, their final average compensation, and their total years of credited service during their career at Agilent and HP (if applicable) through October 31, 2009. The total years of credited service     (which includes years of credited service under the HP Retirement Plan as of May 1, 2000) cannot exceed 30 in the 1993 Benefit Formula. The minimum monthly retirement benefits beginning at age 65 (or later if the participant retires after age 65 but     before they reach age 70 ½) are determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.5%  X    Highest Average Pay               Rate at October 31, 2009  X    Years of Credited Service at               October 31, 2009 not               to exceed 30 
1.5%  X    Highest Average Pay               Rate at October 31, 2009  X    Years of Credited Service at               October 31, 2009 not               to exceed 30 
[END TABLE]
The reduction based on 0.6% of the final average compensation recognizes the company's contribution through payroll taxes towards Social Security benefits.
[BEGIN TABLE]
0.6%  X    Final Average               Compensation at               October 31, 2009  X    Years of Credited Service at                 October 31, 2009 not  to exceed 30 
0.6%  X    Final Average               Compensation at               October 31, 2009  X    Years of Credited Service at                 October 31, 2009 not  to exceed 30 
[END TABLE]
Some participants will have Retirement Plan benefits that are comprised of both 2009 Benefit Formula benefits that are calculated as a lump sum payable at age 65     and 1993 Benefit Formula benefits that are calculated as monthly annuity payments beginning at age 65. In this case, the total Retirement Plan benefits payable at age 65 are equal to (a) the value of the accrued benefits under the 2009 Benefit formula     plus, (b) the value of the accrued benefits under the 1993 Benefit Formula, both of which must be payable in the same form. By using actuarial conversion factors, both the 2009 Benefit Formula and the 1993 Benefit Formula benefits can be converted so     that both are paid as either an annuity or a lump sum.
The normal form of benefits under the Retirement Plan are either a single life annuity for single participants or a 50% joint and survivor annuity for married     participants. Participants may elect to receive payments at any time following termination or retirement in the above forms or as an actuarially equivalent 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, or as a one-time lump sum. Payments made prior to normal     retirement age will be reduced in accordance with the plan provisions.
Retirement Plan Benefit Reductions If Paid Prior to Age 65
The benefits under the 2009 Benefit Formula will be reduced by 5% of compound interest for each year that the benefits are paid before the participant reaches       age 65.
The benefits under the 1993 Benefit Formula will be reduced as set forth below:
If the 1993 Benefit is paid before age 55, an additional reduction is applied. The benefit reduced to 50% at age 55 as described above, is       further reduced based on an "actuarial equivalence factor." The actuarial equivalence factor is determined based on the number of months the payment begins before age 55, applicable interest rates and applicable mortality table, and the participant's       life expectancy.
Participants who have less than 15 Years of Service must use a different calculation which may result in a larger reduction to their benefit.
All regular full-time or regular part-time employees hired prior to August 1, 2015 automatically become participants in the Retirement Plan on the May 1 or       November 1 following the completion of two years of service.
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan
The Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan is a frozen, tax-qualified defined contribution plan. HP, Inc. created and maintained a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan to provide       its employees benefits with respect to their service with HP prior to November 1, 1993. Agilent and then Keysight replicated the frozen HP Deferred Profit Sharing Plan to continue to provide a retirement benefit to former HP employees for service       with HP prior to November 1, 1993. The benefits under the Deferred Profit Sharing Plan are used as a floor offset for the Retirement Plan for benefits accrued under the 1993 Benefit Formula but only with respect to service prior to November 1, 1993.       There have been no contributions into the plan since October 31, 1993. For the benefits attributable to service after October 31, 1993 under both the 1993 Benefit Formula and the 2009 Benefit Formula, there is no Deferred Profit Sharing Plan offset.
For service prior to November 1, 1993 (if any), the benefit due is the greater of (i) the benefit defined by the Retirement Plan formula, or (ii) the       annuity value of the Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan account balance. Therefore, for service prior to November 1, 1993, the Retirement Plan determines a minimum retirement benefit amount.
The normal form of benefits under the Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan are payable at normal retirement age as either a single life annuity for single participants,       or a 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants. Participants may elect to receive payments at any time following termination or retirement and in the above forms or as 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, or as a one-time lump sum.
Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan and the Excess Benefit Retirement Plan
The Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan and the Excess Benefit Retirement Plan (which was frozen December 31, 2004) are unfunded, non-qualified plans. Benefits       payable under both plans are equal to the excess of the qualified Retirement Plan amount that would be payable in accordance with the terms of the Retirement Plan disregarding the benefit and compensation limitations imposed pursuant to sections 415       and 401(a)(17) of the Code.
Participants in the Retirement Plan and/or Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan, whose retirement benefits under those tax-qualified plans are limited by Sections       401(a)(17) or 415 of the Code their Keysight employment, automatically become a participant in the Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan.
Benefits under the Supplemental Benefit Retirement Plan and the Excess Benefit Retirement Plan are payable upon termination or retirement as follows:
Malaysian Defined Contribution Plan
All employees in Malaysia participate in the government mandatory retirement plan, managed by the Employer Provident Fund (EPF), a government agency.  This plan       requires contribution from both the employer and the employee. We contribute a fixed contribution rate of 12%.  Mr. Gooi participates in this plan with an 11% contribution rate. Employees can also opt to contribute at a lower rate of 9%.  In       addition, Mr. Gooi also participates in a Company-wide EPF Top-up plan, for which we contribute 3% of monthly base earning.  No employee contributions are accepted for this plan.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation in         Last Fiscal Year
The Deferred Compensation Plan is available to all active employees on our U.S. payroll with total target cash salary, including the short-term Performance-Based       Compensation Plan, greater than or equal to $275,000 for 2018.
There are four types of earnings that may be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan:
Deferral elections may be made annually and can be part of overall tax planning for executives. There are several hypothetical investment options available under       the Deferred Compensation Plan, which generally mirror the investment choices under the tax-qualified 401(k) Plan. All hypothetical investment choices are made by the participant. Based on market performance, dividends and interest are credited to       participants' hypothetical accounts from the investment funds that the participant has elected.
At the time participation is elected, employees must also elect payout in one of two forms that can commence upon termination or be delayed by an additional one,       two or three years following termination:
Payouts are distributed to eligible participants in January of the year following termination, if termination occurs during the first six months of the calendar       year. Otherwise, payouts are distributed to eligible participants in July of the year following termination where termination occurs during the second half of the calendar year. No early distributions or withdrawals are allowed, except in the event       of an unforeseeable emergency, death or where the participant elected to make an in-service distribution on a fixed date. When and if received, a participant in the LTP Program may elect to defer his or her shares through the Deferred Compensation       Plan at the time the award is granted. The LTP Program shares are deferred in the form of shares of our common stock only. At the end of the deferral period, the shares are simply released to the participant.
Although there is no obligation to fund the Deferred Compensation Plan, Keysight has established a rabbi trust as a source of funds to make payments under the       Deferred Compensation Plan. The table below provides information on the non-qualified deferred compensation of our NEOs for fiscal year 2018.

Termination Arrangements – Severance Plan, Change of Control Severance         Agreements & Equity Award Acceleration
Set forth below is a description of the plans and agreements that could result in potential payments to our NEOs in the case of their termination of       employment and/or a change of control of Keysight.
Severance Plan
On March 18, 2015, the Compensation Committee adopted the Keysight Technologies, Inc. Officer and Executive Severance Plan (the       "Severance Plan"). The Severance Plan provides for severance payments and benefits ("Severance Benefits") to our executive officers and vice presidents. The Severance Benefits do not apply in connection with a change of control of Keysight if an       executive officer or vice president is covered under a change of control severance agreement or similar arrangement with Keysight. Accordingly, our NEOs who have each entered into a Change of Control Severance Agreement with us would only be entitled       to the Severance Benefits in connection with a termination that occurs outside of the change of control context. The Severance Plan replaces any benefits provided by a workforce management program.
In general, in order to qualify for Severance Benefits, the executive officer's or vice president's employment must have been terminated       either (i) by us other than for "cause", misconduct, death, or physical or mental incapacity or (ii) by the executive officer or vice president for "good reason". In addition to satisfying other conditions set forth in the Severance Plan, to qualify       for Severance Benefits, the executive officer or vice president must execute a general release of claims in favor of Keysight and comply with certain post-termination restrictions, including, among other things, not soliciting our employees or the       employees of our affiliates for a period of two years, continuing to comply with the terms his or her proprietary information and non-disclosure agreement, not making certain public statements concerning Keysight without first receiving Keysight's       written approval, and not taking actions that could cause Keysight or its employees or agents any embarrassment or humiliation or otherwise cause or contribute to Keysight or any such person being held in disrepute by the general public or Keysight's       employees, clients, or customers.
The Severance Plan provides for: (i) a lump sum cash severance payment, (ii) a pro-rated annual cash incentive award, if any, for the       performance period in which the executive officer's or vice president's employment terminates, subject to the achievement of the performance goals and other terms and conditions that apply to him or her for that performance period, provided that any       individual goals will be deemed to have been earned at target, (iii) 12 months of accelerated vesting of stock awards that are subject only to service-based vesting conditions and are held by executive officers and vice presidents that are not       retirement eligible, (iv) waiver of the service-vesting condition for restricted stock unit and/or restricted stock awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, which will remain outstanding subject to the applicable performance       conditions, and (v) a lump sum cash payment of $20,000 ($40,000 in the case of our CEO) to pay for the cost of COBRA health benefit continuation coverage or to be used for any other purpose the executive officer or vice president chooses. The amount       of the lump sum severance payment in the case of our executive officers, equals 100% (200% in the case of our CEO) of the sum of (i) his or her current annual base salary and (ii) his or her average actual annual cash incentive award percentage as       compared to the target percentage paid for the three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year in which he or she terminates employment, applied to his or her current base salary. For our vice presidents, the amount of the lump sum severance payment       equals 100% of his or her annual base salary only and does not take into account his or her cash incentive award.
Further, if the executive officer or vice president is retirement-eligible under the terms of the applicable stock award, the executive       officer or vice president will not receive the benefits described above but will instead benefit from the retirement treatment set forth in such award in accordance with its terms and the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Change of Control Severance Agreements
As noted above, each of our NEOs has entered into a Change of Control Severance Agreement with us. Under the Change of Control Severance       Agreements, if a change of control of Keysight occurs and an NEO is involuntarily terminated without "cause" or voluntarily terminates within 3 months following the occurrence of an event constituting "good reason", and such involuntary termination       or "good reason" event occurs (i) within three months prior to a change of control, (ii) at the time of or within 24 months following the occurrence of a change of control, or (iii) at any time prior to a change of control, if such termination is at       the request of the acquirer, then the NEO will be entitled to: (i) two times, or with respect to Mr. Nersesian three times, the sum of his base salary and target cash incentive award, (ii) payment of $80,000 for medical insurance premiums, (iii) full       vesting of all outstanding stock options and stock awards not subject to performance-based vesting, and (iv) a pro-rated cash incentive award under any cash incentive award plan applicable to the NEO, for the performance period in which the NEO's       termination of employment occurs equal to the amount, if any, of the cash incentive award the NEO would have been paid based on the achievement of performance goals under the terms of such cash incentive award plan had the NEO continued employment       with Keysight until the end of such performance period. In addition, if the NEO experiences a qualifying termination prior to a change of control and any of his unvested stock awards terminate prior to the change of control before such awards would       have otherwise vested on account of the qualifying termination, the NEO will receive a cash payment equal to the value of the shares that would have vested on the date of the change of control less any exercise price. The NEO's stock awards that are       subject to performance-based vesting will be governed by the applicable award agreement. The Change of Control Severance Agreements replace any benefits provided by a workforce management program.
As a condition to receiving such severance benefits, an NEO must execute a release of all of his rights and claims relating to his       employment and comply with certain post-termination restrictions, including, among other things, not soliciting our employees or the employees of our affiliates for a period of two years, continuing to comply with the terms his proprietary       information and non-disclosure agreement, not making certain public statements concerning Keysight without first receiving the Keysight's written approval, and not taking actions that could cause Keysight or its employees or agents any embarrassment       or humiliation or otherwise cause or contribute to Keysight or any such person being held in disrepute by the general public or Keysight's employees, clients, or customers.
The Change of Control Severance Agreements with our NEOs do not provide for tax gross-ups of payments subject to the "golden parachute"       excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Each Change of Control Severance Agreement instead contains a "better after-tax" provision, which provides that if any of the payments to the NEO constitutes a parachute payment under Section 280G of the       Code, the payments will either be (i) reduced or (ii) provided in full to the NEO, whichever results in the NEO receiving the greater amount after taking into consideration the payment of all taxes, including the excise tax under Section 4999 of the       Code.
Acceleration and Continued Vesting of Equity Awards
Under each NEO's stock award agreements, if an NEO dies or becomes fully disabled, his unvested stock options or stock awards that are       subject only to service-based vesting conditions will fully vest and any performance awards will be earned, if at all, based on the satisfaction of the applicable performance measures and pro-rated if such death or disability occurs within the first       12 months of the vesting period. In addition, under each NEO's stock award agreements when an NEO retires, his stock options and stock awards that are subject only to service-based vesting conditions continue to vest and any performance awards will       be earned, if at all, based on the satisfaction of the applicable performance measures and pro-rated if such retirement occurs within the first 12 months of the vesting period. Currently, only Mr. Nersesian, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Gooi are entitled to       retirement vesting based on company-wide equity award agreement eligibility. In addition, in the event there is a change of control, under the Stock Plan, options or stock awards will fully vest immediately prior to the closing of the transaction       unless such awards are assumed, converted or replaced in full by the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor. Stock options and stock awards that are subject only to service-based vesting conditions vest on a "double-trigger"       basis in connection with a change of control of Keysight pursuant to the Severance Plan and each NEO's Change of Control Severance Agreement as discussed above, while each NEO's performance awards provide that in the event of a change of control,       such awards will be paid out at the greater of the target award or the accrued amount of the payout but will be pro-rated if such change of control occurs within the first 12 months of the vesting period.
"Cause," "Good Reason" and "Change of Control" Definitions
For purposes of the Severance Plan, "good reason" means a material diminution in an executive officer's or vice president's authority,       duties or responsibilities resulting in a significant diminution of position without the executive officer's or vice president's consent that is not cured by Keysight within 30 days of written notice to Keysight by the executive officer or the vice       president of such diminution. "Good reason" will only exist if the executive officer or the vice president notifies Keysight of the occurrence of the events giving rise to such "good reason" within 30 days of their initial occurrence. An executive       officer's or vice president's authority, duties or responsibilities will not be considered to be significantly diminished so long as the executive officer or the vice president continues to perform substantially the same functional role for Keysight       as he or she performed immediately prior to the occurrence the events alleged to constitute "good reason" whether in the same location or another location assigned to him or her by Keysight. In addition, an executive officer's or vice president's       authority, duties or responsibilities will not be considered to be significantly diminished solely by reason of a change to his or her title or compensation or benefits.
For purposes of the Change of Control Severance Agreements, "good reason" means (i) a more than $10,000 reduction of the NEO's rate of       compensation as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the agreement or in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of a change of control, whichever is greater, other than reductions in base salary that apply broadly to employees of       Keysight or reductions due to varying metrics and achievement of performance goals for different periods under variable pay programs; (ii) the failure to provide a package of benefits which, taken as a whole, provides substantially similar benefits       to those in which the NEO is entitled to participate in the day prior to the occurrence of the change of control or any action by Keysight which would significantly and adversely affect the NEO's participation or reduce the NEO's benefits under any       of such plans in existence the day prior to the Change of Control, other than changes that apply broadly to employees of Keysight; (iii) a change in the NEO's duties, responsibilities, authority, job title, or reporting relationships resulting in a       significant diminution of position, (excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith which is remedied by Keysight within 30 days after notice thereof is given by the NEO); (iv) the NEO relocates to       a worksite that is more than 35 miles from the NEO's prior worksite, unless the NEO consents to such relocation; (v) failure or refusal of a successor to Keysight to assume Keysight's obligations under the Change of Control Service Agreement; or (vi)       the material breach by Keysight or any successor to Keysight of any of the material provisions of the NEO's Change of Control Severance Agreement. The NEO's duties, responsibilities, authority, job title or reporting relationships will not be       considered to be significantly diminished so long as the NEO continues to perform substantially the same functional role for Keysight as the NEO performed immediately prior to the occurrence of the change of control, even if Keysight becomes a       subsidiary or division of another entity. In addition, to constitute "good reason", the NEO must notify Keysight of any event purporting to constitute "good reason" within 60 days following the NEO's knowledge of its existence, and Keysight will have       30 days in which to correct or remove such "good reason", or such event will not constitute "good reason".
For purposes of the Severance Plan and the Change of Control Severance Agreements, "cause" means misconduct, including: (i) conviction       of any felony or any crime involving moral turpitude or dishonesty that has a material adverse effect on Keysight's business or reputation; (ii) repeated unexplained or unjustified absences from Keysight; (iii) refusal or willful failure to act in       accordance with any specific directions or orders of Keysight that has a material adverse effect on Keysight's business or reputation; (iv) a material and willful violation of any state or federal law that would materially injure the business or       reputation of Keysight as reasonably determined by the Board; (v) participation in a fraud or act of dishonesty against Keysight which has a material adverse effect on Keysight's business or reputation; or (vi) intentional, material violation by the       NEO of any contract between the NEO and Keysight or any statutory duty of the NEO to Keysight that is not corrected within 30 days after written notice to the officer; provided, however, that "cause" in the case of the Change of Control Severance       Agreements also means conduct by the NEO that the Board determines demonstrates gross unfitness to serve, and the NEO's refusal or willful failure to act in accordance with any written policies of Keysight that has a material adverse effect on       Keysight's business or reputation.
For purposes of the Change of Control Severance Agreements and the Stock Plan, a "Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the       following events: (i) the sale, exchange, lease or other disposition or transfer of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Keysight to a person or group which will continue the business of Keysight in the future; (ii) a merger or       consolidation involving Keysight in which the shareholders of Keysight immediately prior to such merger or consolidation are not the beneficial owners of more than 75% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation       resulting from such transaction in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of Keysight immediately prior to such merger or consolidation; or (iii) the acquisition of       beneficial ownership of at least 25% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities of Keysight by a person or group. For purposes of the Change of Control Severance Agreements, a "Change of Control" also occurs if the incumbent       members of the Board as of November 1, 2014 or their successors cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board.
Termination and Change of Control Table
For each of our NEOs, the table below estimates the amount of compensation that would be paid in the event of the following:
The amounts shown assume that each of the terminations was effective as of October 31, 2018.
Pay Ratio Disclosure
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of       Regulation S-K, Keysight is providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of its employees to the annual total compensation of Mr. Nersesian, our CEO. To understand this disclosure, we believe that it is       important to give context to Keysight's operations. Keysight's corporate headquarters is in Santa Rosa, California with employees in over 31 countries. As a global organization, approximately 65% of Keysight's employees were located outside of the       U.S. as of October 31, 2018. The countries with the largest number of our employees are the United States, Malaysia, India, China, and Germany.
Keysight is engaged in a very competitive industry, and its success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain highly     qualified, talented and creative employees. Consistent with our executive compensation program, Keysight's global compensation program is designed to be competitive in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which an employee is     located. Accordingly, our pay structures vary among our employees based on position, geographic location and consideration of local competitive market practices.
Pay Ratio
For fiscal year 2018, Keysight's last completed fiscal year:
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Nersesian to the median of the annual total compensation of     all of Keysight's employees other than Mr. Nersesian is estimated to be 1 to 89.
Identification of Median Employee
We selected October 31, 2018, the last day of fiscal year 2018, as the date on which to determine our median employee. As of that date,     Keysight had approximately 13,624 employees, including full-time and part-time employees, employee on leave of absence and temporary employees. For purposes of identifying the median employee, we considered the aggregate of the following compensation     elements for each of our employees, as compiled from Keysight's internal records as of October 31, 2018:
We selected the above compensation elements because they represent Keysight's principal broad-based compensation elements. For purposes of     identifying the median employee, any compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on the accounting rates as of October 31, 2018. These rates are set on the last workday of each month for the following month using current     market rates. For example, the February accounting rate is set using market rates on January 31st. In identifying the median employee, we have considered all employees who joined the company through acquisitions during the last fiscal year and we did     not make any cost-of-living adjustments or exclude any foreign jurisdictions in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, the employee's compensation was calculated in accordance with Item     402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, as required pursuant to the SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table with respect to each     of Keysight's NEOs.
