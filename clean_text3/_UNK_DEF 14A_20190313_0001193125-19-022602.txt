PROXY STATEMENT 
INTRODUCTION 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of The China Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting"), to be held at the offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 101 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10178, on Wednesday, March 13, 2019, at 1:00 P.M., Eastern Time, and at any adjournments thereof. 
This Proxy Statement and the form of proxy card are being mailed to stockholders on or about January 30, 2019. Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it by executing a superseding proxy by phone, Internet or mail following the process described on the proxy card or by submitting a notice of revocation to the Fund prior to the date of the Meeting or in person at the Meeting. All properly executed proxies received in time for the Meeting will be voted as specified in the proxy or, if no specification is made, for the election of the director as described in Proposal 1 of this Proxy Statement. 
The presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast one third of the votes entitled to be cast thereat constitutes a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, executed proxies returned without marking a vote on Proposal 1 will be treated as shares that are present for quorum purposes. Abstentions are included in the determination of the number of shares present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. If a stockholder is present in person or by proxy at the Meeting but does not cast a vote, the stockholder's shares will count towards a quorum but will have no effect on Proposal 1. In the event a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or in the event that a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1 are not received, holders of a majority of the stock present in person or by proxy have power to adjourn the meeting. In addition, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn any meeting of stockholders from time to time (a) to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the meeting or (b) provided that a new notice is given and a new record date is set, to a date more than 120 days after the original record date. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the Meeting as originally notified. The Fund may set a subsequent record date and give notice of it to stockholders, in which case the meeting may be held not more than 120 days beyond the subsequent record date. The Fund may postpone or cancel a meeting of stockholders by making a public announcement of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. Notice of the date, time, and place to which the meeting is postponed is required to be given not less than ten days prior to such date and otherwise in the manner set forth in the Fund's By-Laws. 
The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on January 14, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and at any adjournments thereof. Stockholders on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held, with no shares having cumulative voting rights. As of the record date, the Fund had outstanding 15,722,675 shares of common stock. The Fund   expects the number of outstanding shares to be reduced to 11,005,872 following completion of the Fund's offer to repurchase up to 30% of its outstanding shares on February 4, 2019. 
Management of the Fund knows of no item of business other than that mentioned in Proposal 1 of the Notice of Meeting that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote in accordance with their best judgment. 
The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its annual report for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 to any stockholder requesting such report.

PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTOR 
The Fund's By-Laws provide that the Board of Directors is to be divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. The terms of office of the present directors (each a "Director") in each class expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the year indicated or thereafter in each case when their respective successors are elected and qualified: Class I, 2021; Class II, 2019; and Class III, 2020. At each subsequent annual election, Directors chosen to succeed those whose terms are expiring will be identified as being in the same class and will be elected for a three-year term. The effect of these staggered terms is to limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund by delaying the replacement of a majority of the Board. 
The term of Gary L. French, a Class II Director, would have expired at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; however, he has submitted his resignation as a Director effective February 15, 2019. Mr. Michael F. Holland and Mr. Li Jin, each also a Class II Director of the Fund have chosen not to stand for re-election. As a result, effective with the commencement of the Meeting, the size of the Board of Directors is set to four. In addition, the Board of Directors has re-designated Richard A. Silver, formerly a Class I Director, as a Class II Director and Directors nominated Mr. Silver to serve as a Class II Director of the Fund until the Fund's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until his successor is duly elected and qualified. Mr. William C. Kirby had advised the Board of Directors that he intends to resign as a Director of the Fund at the end of March 2019. At that time, the Board of Directors will determine whether to appoint a new Director in place of Mr. Kirby or to reduce the size of the Board of Directors to three. 
The persons named in the accompanying form of proxy card intend, in the absence of contrary instructions, to vote all proxies for the election of Mr. Richard A. Silver to serve for a term expiring on the date on which the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held in 2022, or until his successor is elected and qualified. The nominee has indicated that he will serve if elected. If the nominee should be unable to serve, an event not now anticipated, the proxies will be voted for such person, if any, as is designated by the Board of Directors to replace the nominee. The election of a Director will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting. Presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of a stockholder who does not cast a vote will have no effect on the outcome of the election.  INFORMATION RELATING TO PROPOSAL 1 
Information Concerning the Nominee and Current Members of the Board of Directors 
The following table provides information concerning the nominee and other current members of the Board of Directors of the Fund each of whom is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and therefore is deemed to be "independent."

 Leadership Structure and Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has general oversight responsibility with respect to the business and affairs of the Fund. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the operations of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, other applicable laws and the Fund's Articles of Incorporation. The Board is currently composed of seven Independent Directors and one of the Independent Directors serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Generally, the Board of Directors acts by majority vote of all of the Directors, including a majority vote of the Independent Directors if required by applicable law. Following the Meeting, the Board will be composed of four Directors. The Fund's day-to-day operations are managed by Matthews International Capital Management, LLC ("Matthews Asia"), the Fund's Investment Manager, and other service providers who have been approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors meets periodically throughout the year to oversee the Fund's activities, review contractual arrangements with service providers, oversee compliance with regulatory requirements and review performance. The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given the size of the Board, the fact that all of the Directors are not interested persons, and the nature of the Fund. 
The Directors were selected to serve and continue on the Board of Directors based upon their skills, experience, judgment, analytical ability, diligence, ability to work effectively with other Directors and a commitment to the interests of stockholders and a demonstrated willingness to take an independent and questioning view of management. Each Director also has considerable familiarity with the Fund and the Administrator, and their operations, as well as the special regulatory requirements governing regulated investment companies and the special responsibilities of investment company directors as a result of his/her substantial prior service as a Director or officer of the Fund and, in several cases, as a director or executive of other investment companies. In addition to those qualifications, the following is a brief summary of the specific experience, qualifications or skills that led to the conclusion, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, that each person identified below should serve as a Director for the Fund. References to the qualifications, attributes and skills of the Directors are pursuant to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and do not constitute a holding out of the Board of Directors or any Director as having any special expertise and should not be considered to impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board of Directors by reason thereof than the normal responsibility and liability of an investment company board member or board. As required by rules the SEC has adopted under the 1940 Act, the Fund's Independent Directors select and nominate all candidates for Independent Director positions.

She has also served as chair of the boards of three families of funds and President of the Americas Mutual Funds Group at Scudder Investments, responsible for four North American based retail businesses including three families of open and closed end mutual funds, the Americas offshore mutual funds group and the firm's defined contribution business. 
The Fund's Board of Directors has an Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee, which is responsible for reviewing financial and accounting matters. The Fund's Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee is   comprised of all of the Directors, all of whom are not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act), and its actions are governed by the Fund's written Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee Charter. The current members of the Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee are Ms. Coughlin and Messrs. French, Holland, Kirby, Jin, Reid and Silver. All members of the Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee are independent as independence is defined in the New York Stock Exchange's ("NYSE") listing standards, as may be modified or supplemented. The Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee was established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). The Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee has a charter which is available on the Fund's website (www.chinafundinc.com). 
The Fund's Board of Directors has a Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee, comprised of the current members of the Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee, which is responsible for nominating candidates to fill any vacancies on the Board of Directors. All of the members of the Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee are independent as independence is defined in the NYSE listing standards, as may be modified or supplemented and are not interested persons of the Fund. Currently, the Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee does not have a policy to consider nominees recommended by stockholders. The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee believes that it is not necessary to have such a policy because the Board of Directors consists entirely of Directors who are not interested persons of the Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act). The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee evaluates a candidate's qualifications for Board of Directors membership and the candidate's independence from the Fund's Investment Manager and other principal service providers. The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee does not have specific minimum qualifications that must be met by candidates recommended by the Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee and there is not a specific process for identifying such candidates. In nominating candidates, the Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate. These factors may include judgment, skill, diversity, experience with businesses or other organizations of comparable size, the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board of Directors members, requirements of the NYSE and the SEC to maintain a minimum number of independent or non-interested directors, requirements of the SEC as to disclosure regarding persons with financial expertise on the Fund's Audit, Valuation and Compliance Committee and the extent to which the candidate generally would be a desirable addition to the Board of Directors and any committees of the Board of Directors. The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee believes the Board of Directors generally benefits from diversity of background, experience and views among its members, and considers this a factor in evaluating the composition of the Board of Directors, but has not adopted any specific policy in this regard. The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Governance, Nominating and Compensation Committee has a charter which is available on the Fund's website (www.chinafundinc.com). 
The Fund does not have a specified process for stockholders to send communications to the Board of Directors because stockholders are able to communicate directly with the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the Fund's reports to stockholders disclose contact information which may be used to direct communications to the Board of Directors. 
The Fund does not have a policy regarding Board of Directors members' attendance at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, one Director attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The Fund's Board of Directors held four regular meetings and twelve special meetings during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. Each Director attended at least seventy-five percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and of any committee on which he or she served.  Risk Oversight 
The day-to-day operations of the Fund, including the management of risk, is performed by third party service providers, such as the Fund's Investment Manager (Matthews Asia) and Administrator (State Street). The Directors are responsible for overseeing the Fund's service providers and thus have oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management performed by those service providers. Risk management seeks to identify and address risks, i.e., events or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, stockholder services, investment performance or reputation of the Fund. The Fund and its service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify certain of those possible events or circumstances, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. 
Not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified nor can controls be developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. It may not be practical or cost effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, the processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness, and some risks are simply beyond the reasonable control of the Fund or the Investment Manager or other service providers. Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Fund's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations. 
Risk oversight forms part of the Board of Directors' general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board of Directors and Committee activities. As part of its regular oversight of the Fund, the Board, directly or through a Committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the Investment Manager, the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund. The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the Investment Manager and receives information about those services at its regular meetings. In addition, on an annual basis, in connection with its consideration of whether to renew the Fund's Advisory Agreements, the Board of Directors meets with the Investment Manager to review the services provided. Among other things, the Board of Directors regularly considers the Investment Manager's adherence to the Fund's investment restrictions and compliance with various Fund policies and procedures and with applicable securities regulations. The Board of Directors has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of the Fund's compliance program and reports to the Board of Directors regarding compliance matters for the Fund and its service providers. The Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Investment Manager, reviews investment policies and risks in connection with its review of the Fund's performance. In addition, as part of the Board of Directors' oversight of the Fund's Investment Manager and other service provider agreements, the Board may periodically consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act requires the Fund's officers and Directors, and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of a registered class of the Fund's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act extends the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act to the investment adviser or manager of the Fund and the officers and directors of such investment adviser or manager. The Fund believes that its officers and Directors and the officers of the Investment Manager have complied with all applicable filing requirements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.
