[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What Proposal am I being asked to vote for in this Proxy Statement?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proposal 1: Election of Trustees. At a meeting on September 14, 2018, the Board, including the  Independent Trustees (as defined below), and the Nominating and Governance Committee, nominated and/or recommended ten individuals for election or re-election to the Board. Shareholders are asked to elect the  nominees to serve as Trustees. If elected, each Trustee will serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her resignation, death or retirement. It has been five years since a meeting of shareholders was last held to  elect members of the Board, and changes since that time in the composition of the Board now necessitate a meeting to elect the nominees. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") at least  two-thirds of the Trustees must be elected by shareholders.

(All Funds) 
Shareholders of each of the Funds are being asked to elect ten Trustees to serve on LVIP's Board of Trustees. 
Who are the nominees for Trustee? 
The nominees are: Ellen G. Cooper, Steve A. Cobb, Elizabeth S. Hager, Barbara L. Lamb, Gary D. Lemon, Ph.D., Thomas A. Leonard, Charles I. Plosser, Pamela L. Salaway, Brian W. Wixted, and Nancy B. Wolcott (the "Trustee Nominees"). Five current members of the Board of Trustees, Messrs. Cobb, Lemon and Leonard and Mmes. Hager and Salaway, are standing for re-election by shareholders. Three current members of the Board of Trustees, Mmes. Cooper and Wolcott and Mr. Plosser, were previously elected by the Board and will stand for election by shareholders as Trustees for the first time. Ms. Lamb and Mr. Wixted are not currently members of the Board of Trustees. Among the Trustee Nominees, Ms. Cooper is an "interested person" of LVIP as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Ms. Cooper is an interested person of LVIP because she is a Director and Chairman of LVIP's investment adviser, Lincoln Investment Advisors Corporation, and a Director and an officer of The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, the parent company of the LVIP's investment adviser. The remaining Trustee Nominees would be deemed to be "Independent Trustees" (i.e., Trustees who are not "interested persons" of LVIP). Please refer to "How are nominees for Trustees selected?" for further detail on the nomination process. 
Under the 1940 Act, generally, no person may serve as a member of a mutual fund board of trustees unless that person was elected as a trustee by the outstanding voting securities of the fund. However, a new trustee may be appointed by the existing board members if immediately after such appointment at least two-thirds of the trustees then holding office have been elected to such office by the holders of the outstanding voting securities at an annual or special meeting of shareholders. 
If elected, each LVIP Trustee Nominee will serve as Trustee until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified for office or until his or her earlier resignation, death or retirement. Trustees shall retire no later than the end of the calendar year in which the Trustee turns 75 years old. Thus, Ms. Hager is scheduled to retire at the end of 2019. Each Trustee Nominee is currently available and has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. 
The table below provides certain background information for each nominee, including the number of Funds that the nominee oversees.  INFORMATION ON THE NOMINEES

Each Trustee also has familiarity with LVIP, its investment adviser and distributor, and their operations, as well as the special regulatory requirements governing regulated investment companies and the special responsibilities of investment company trustees. 
What are the responsibilities of the Board of Trustees? 
The primary responsibility of the Board is to represent the interests of LVIP's shareholders and to provide oversight of the management of the Funds. LVIP's primary day-to-day operations are managed by the investment adviser and other service providers who have been approved by the Board. The Board is currently comprised of eight Trustees, seven of whom are classified under the 1940 Act as "non-interested" persons of LVIP (Independent Trustees) and one of whom is classified as an interested person of the Trust (Interested Trustee). The Interested Trustee Nominee, Ms. Cooper, serves as the Chairperson of the Board. 
As part of its general oversight of LVIP, the Board is involved in the risk oversight of LVIP. The Board/Investment Committee reviews the Funds' investment performance with the adviser at each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. In addition, the Board must approve any material changes to a Fund's investment policies or restrictions. With respect to compliance matters, LVIP's Chief Compliance Officer provides the annual compliance report required by Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, a quarterly report to the Audit Committee regarding the operation of LVIP's compliance policies and procedures and any material compliance issues that arose during the quarter, and meets with the Audit Committee at its quarterly meetings. 
The Board considered the number of Funds in LVIP, LVIP's total assets, and the general nature of the Funds' investments and determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given the characteristics of LVIP. 
The Board has a Lead Independent Trustee that serves as the primary liaison between LVIP's management and the Independent Trustees. The Lead Independent Trustee is selected by the Independent Trustees and serves until a successor is selected. Mr. Leonard currently serves as the Lead Independent Trustee. 
Generally, the Board acts by majority vote of all the Trustees, including a majority vote of the Independent Trustees if required by applicable law. The Board establishes the policies and reviews and approves contracts and their continuance. The Board regularly requests and/or receives reports from the investment adviser, LVIP's other service providers and LVIP's Chief Compliance Officer. The Board has established three standing committees and has delegated certain responsibilities to those committees. The Board and its committees meet periodically throughout the year   to oversee LVIP's activities, review the Funds' expenses, oversee compliance with regulatory requirements and review investment performance. The Independent Trustees are represented by independent legal counsel at Board meetings. 
A description of the composition and responsibilities of the Board committees follows: 
Audit Committee. The Board has established an Audit Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the Funds' financial reporting process on behalf of the Board and for reporting the result of their activities to the Board. The Audit Committee assists and acts as a liaison with the Board in fulfilling the Board's responsibility to shareholders of LVIP and others relating to oversight of Fund accounting, LVIP's systems of control, LVIP's programs for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations, and the quality and integrity of the financial statements, financial reports, and the audit of LVIP. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees LVIP's accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control systems. The members of the Audit Committee are Independent Trustees: Thomas A. Leonard (Chair), Elizabeth S. Hager, and Nancy B. Wolcott. The Audit Committee met four times during the last fiscal year. 
Investment Committee. The Board has established an Investment Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the performance of the Funds and other tasks as requested by the Board. The members of the Investment Committee include Independent Trustees: Pamela L. Salaway (Chair), Steve A. Cobb, Gary D. Lemon, and Charles I. Plosser. The Investment Committee met four times during the last fiscal year. 
Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board has established a Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, the identification, evaluation and nomination of potential independent trustee candidates to serve on the Board. The Board has adopted a charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee setting forth such Committee's responsibilities. A copy of the charter is included as Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement. The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are Independent Trustees: Steve A. Cobb (Chair), Elizabeth S. Hager, Gary D. Lemon, Thomas A. Leonard, Charles Plosser, Pamela L. Salaway, and Nancy Wolcott. The Nominating and Governance Committee met four times during the last fiscal year. 
How are nominees for Trustees selected? 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and nominating candidates for Board membership as Independent Trustees through personal and business contacts of the Trustees. In addition, the Committee may use a search firm to identify candidates for the Board, if deemed necessary and appropriate to use such a firm. The Committee's process for evaluating Independent Trustee candidates generally includes a review of the candidate's background and experience and other due diligence as the Committee deems appropriate.  The Nominating and Governance Committee independently evaluates independent trustee candidates for Board membership. The Nominating and Governance Committee has not established any specific requirements that a candidate must meet in order to recommend the candidate to the Board to serve as a Trustee. In considering candidates for Board membership, the Committee takes into account a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to: (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board; (ii) relevant industry and related experience; (iii) educational background; (iv) financial expertise; (v) an assessment of the candidate's ability, judgment and expertise; and (iv) the overall diversity of the Board's composition. While the Nominating and Governance Committee considers overall diversity as a factor in evaluating the composition of the Board, the Committee does not have a formal policy in this regard. 
In nominating Ms. Lamb, Mr. Plosser, Mr. Wixted, and Ms. Wolcott, the four Trustee Nominees who qualify as Independent Trustees and who were not previously elected by shareholders, the Committee independently evaluated each such nominee considering the factors listed above in addition to the business background and attributes of each such nominee set forth in this Proxy Statement. The Committee determined that the process it followed was appropriate as to each such nominee and that each qualified as an Independent Trustee. Mr. Plosser and Ms. Wolcott are current Board members having been elected by the Board effective January 1, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively, considering the same factors described above. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will accept shareholder recommendations for nomination to the Board. Shareholders who wish to submit recommendations for nominations to the Board must submit their recommendations in writing to LVIP's Nominating and Governance Committee, c/o The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company, P.O. Box 2340, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46802. Shareholders should include appropriate information on the background and qualifications of any person recommended to the Nominating and Governance Committee (e.g., a resume), as well as the candidate's contact information and a written consent from the candidate to serve if nominated and elected.  Do the Nominees for Trustee have an ownership interest in the Funds?

Who are the officers of LVIP? 
The Board appoints officers each year, and from time to time as necessary. The following individuals are executive officers of LVIP: Jayson R. Bronchetti, Jeffrey D. Coutts, Ronald A. Holinsky, William P. Flory, Jr., Matthew S. MacMillen, Jennifer M. Matthews, Benjamin A. Richer, Harold Singleton III, John A. Weston, and Yajun (Alex) Zeng. Exhibit C includes biographic information and past business experience of each officer.  What is the Board recommending? 
The Board is recommending that you provide voting instructions to vote FOR all nominees for Trustee. 
What is the required vote to approve the Proposal? 
Approval of the nominees requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of LVIP represented at the Meeting, which means that the ten nominees who receive the largest number of properly cast votes will be elected as Trustees. 
SHAREHOLDER AND VOTING INFORMATION 
Share Ownership 
The number of shares of the Funds that were outstanding as of the Record Date is listed in the table in Exhibit D. Contract Owners that had an Account allocated to a Fund as of the Record Date are entitled to instruct Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York, or an unaffiliated insurance company, as appropriate, on the manner in which to vote LVIP shares attributable to their variable annuity contract or variable life insurance policy at the Meeting. Record Date shareholders will be entitled to one vote for each full share and a fractional vote for each fractional share that they hold. 
To the knowledge of LVIP, as of the Record Date, no person, except as set forth in the table at Exhibit E, owned of record 5% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of any Fund. On the Record Date, no nominee or Trustee or executive officer of LVIP owned any separate account units attributable to more than one percent of the assets of any class of any Fund. 
Voting Information 
In addition to the solicitation of voting instruction forms and proxy cards by mail, officers and employees of LVIP, without additional compensation, may solicit voting and proxy instructions in person, by telephone, and electronically, including through the Internet. LVIP will also engage a third-party vendor to solicit proxies from Contract Owners or shareholders. The agreement between Computershare Inc., a Delaware corporation (operating through its Computershare Fund Services division) ("CFS") and Lincoln Life states that CFS will provide proxy solicitation and tabulation services for an approximate fee, including out-of-pocket expenses, of $700,000. 
All mailing, printing, legal, proxy solicitation and tabulation expenses associated with the expense of the proposal to elect Trustees will be borne by LVIP. 
At the Meeting, Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York and any other unaffiliated insurance company will vote each Fund's shares held in the Accounts, in accordance   with the instructions received from Contract Owners whose purchase payments were invested, as of the Record Date, in the Funds by the Accounts. For all Accounts that support variable annuity contracts, the number of votes which a Contract Owner may cast when instructing an Insurance Company how to vote is determined by applying the Contract Owner's percentage interest in a Fund to the total number of votes attributable to that Fund. In determining the number of votes, fractional shares will be recognized. The number of votes which a Contract Owner of a variable life insurance policy may cast when instructing Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York or an unaffiliated insurance how to vote is determined as one vote for each $100 of cash value. To the extent that any Fund shares are owned directly by a Fund that operates as a "fund of funds," such fund of funds will "echo" vote those shares directly in the same proportion as all other votes received from the other holders of the underlying Funds' shares. 
Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York and any other unaffiliated insurance companies will vote (i) shares owned by Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York or any other affiliated company; and (ii) each Fund's shares held by the Accounts for which no timely instructions are received, in proportion to the voting instructions which are received with respect to such Fund even if only a small number of Contract Owners provide voting instructions. Therefore, the vote of a small number of shareholders can affect the overall outcome since those fewer votes have a proportional impact. If voting instructions are properly executed and received in a timely manner but they contain no voting directions, the votes represented by those instructions will be cast FOR the proposal considered at the Meeting. 
All properly executed proxy cards received in time for the Meeting will be voted as specified in the proxy card or, if no specification is made, FOR each proposal referred to in this Proxy Statement. 
Revocation of Voting Instructions and Proxies 
Any Contract Owner who provides voting instructions has the power to revoke the instructions by (1) delivering to the Secretary of LVIP (at the address of LVIP provided on the cover page of this proxy statement) written notice of revocation, or (2) submitting superseding voting instructions, in each case at any time prior to the date of the Meeting. Contract Owners may also revoke prior voting instructions by voting in person at the Meeting. 
If you are a direct owner of Fund shares, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by sending a written notice to the Secretary of LVIP (at the address of LVIP provided on the cover page of this Proxy Statement) expressly revoking your proxy, by signing and forwarding to the Fund a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.  Quorum 
A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting and to consider the proposal in this Proxy Statement. For the Proposal, the holders of 331⁄3% of the outstanding shares of LVIP, as appropriate on the Record Date, present in person or by proxy at the Meeting shall constitute a quorum. Shares that are subject to echo voting by Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York and any other unaffiliated insurance company will be counted for purposes of determining quorum. 
Votes Necessary to Approve Proposal 
Approval of the Proposal (election of Trustees) requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of LVIP represented at the Meeting, which means that the ten nominees who receive the largest number of properly cast votes will be elected as Trustees. 
Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
Abstentions with respect to any proposal will count as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not count as votes cast. Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on the Proposal or any proposal to adjourn the Meeting. 
A broker non-vote occurs in connection with a shareholder meeting when the shareholders are asked to consider both "routine" and "non-routine" proposals. In such a case, if a broker-dealer votes on the "routine" proposal, but does not vote on the "non-routine" proposal because (a) the shares entitled to cast the vote are held by the broker-dealer in "street name" for the beneficial owner, (b) the broker-dealer lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares; and (c) the broker-dealer has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, a broker non-vote is said to occur with respect to the "non-routine" proposal. Because broker-dealers generally will not have discretionary authority to vote the shares held by the beneficial owners on the proposals and the proposals are the only items being submitted to shareholders for approval at the Meeting, LVIP does not expect there to be any broker non-votes on the proposal. 
Adjournment 
In the event that sufficient votes to approve a proposal are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment will require an affirmative vote by the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting. In determining whether to adjourn the Meeting with respect to a proposal, the following factors may be considered: the percentage of votes actually cast, the percentage of negative votes actually cast, the nature of any further solicitation and the information to be provided to shareholders with respect to the   reasons for the solicitation. Generally, votes cast in favor of a proposal will be voted in favor of adjournment while votes cast against a proposal will be voted against adjournment. The persons named as proxies will vote upon such adjournment after consideration of the best interests of all shareholders. As stated above, abstentions will have no effect on any proposal to adjourn the Meeting. A shareholder vote may be taken with respect to LVIP or one or more of the Funds on any (but not all) of the proposals prior to any adjournment as to which sufficient votes have been received for approval. 
Other Business 
To the knowledge of the Board, there is no other business to be brought before the Meeting. However, if other matters do properly come before the Meeting, Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York and any other unaffiliated companies intend to vote each Fund's shares in accordance with the judgment of the Board on such matters. The persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will vote their proxies in their discretion on any other items (other than the proposal) that properly come before the Meeting. 
Contract Owner and Shareholder Proposals 
Under authority granted to the Trustees by the Bylaws of LVIP, and pursuant to applicable law, special meetings are called as required. Contract Owners or shareholders desiring to hold their own proxy solicitations in order to submit proposals in years in which the annual meeting is not held may require that a special meeting be called if they can obtain the written request of Contract Owners indirectly or shareholders directly, representing certain stipulated percentages of the outstanding voting securities of the affected Fund. The submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion in the proxy statement and is subject to limitations under the federal securities laws. LVIP is not required to hold regular meetings of shareholders, and in order to minimize its costs, does not intend to hold meetings of shareholders unless so required by applicable law, regulation, regulatory policy, or unless otherwise deemed advisable by the Board or LVIP's management. Therefore, it is not practicable to specify a date by which proposals must be received in order to be incorporated in an upcoming proxy statement for a meeting of shareholders. A Contract Owner or shareholder wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a subsequent shareholder meeting should send his or her written proposals to the Secretary of LVIP at 1300 South Clinton Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46802. Proposals must be received a reasonable time before a Fund begins to print and mail the proxy materials for the Meeting. More detailed information on these procedures for Contract Owners or shareholders may be obtained from Lincoln Life, Lincoln New York or the Secretary of LVIP.  Communications to the Board 
Shareholders who wish to communicate to the full Board or to any individual Trustee may address correspondence to LVIP Board of Trustees, c/o The Lincoln National Insurance Company at P. O. Box 2340, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46802. Without opening any such correspondence, LVIP management will promptly forward all such correspondence to the intended recipient(s). 
OTHER INFORMATION 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
At a meeting held on March 6, 2018, the Audit Committee of LVIP recommended the appointment, and the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, selected Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), One Commerce Square, Suite 700, 2005 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of LVIP for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. In addition to the audits of LVIP's financial statements, other services provided by E&Y include: review of certain regulatory reports; review the Funds' federal income tax returns, and performs other tax and advisory services when engaged to do so by the Trust.; and meetings with the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit, audit related and non-audit services provided by E&Y prior to the commencement of any such engagement. The annual audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. In addition to the annual audit services engagement approved by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant pre-approval to other audit services, which are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide. Furthermore, pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided by E&Y are approved annually by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved levels or amounts require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee monitors the audit services engagements, as necessary, and will also pre-approve any necessary changes in terms, conditions, and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, fee structure, or other items. The Chief Accounting Officer provides information on the annual audit services engagement terms and fees to the Audit Committee at the first regular meeting of the Audit Committee each year. 
Representatives of E&Y are not expected to be present at the Meeting but will have the opportunity to make a statement if they wish and will be available should any matter arise requiring E&Y's presence, such as to respond to appropriate questions. 
The following table includes the respective fees incurred by LVIP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 in connection with the services provided by E&Y with respect to the operations and financial reporting of LVIP. The total estimated fees for services rendered by E&Y to LVIP are $3,128,574   for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. None of the fees billed are applicable to non-audit services rendered by E&Y pursuant to a waiver of pre-approval by the LVIP Audit Committee. Actual fees incurred by LVIP for services provided by E&Y will not be finalized until first quarter of 2019.

Because the Lincoln Variable Insurance Products Trust (LVIP) funds are available as investments for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies (Variable Contracts) offered by certain life insurance companies, the insurance companies could be deemed to control the voting securities of each Fund (i.e., by owning more than 25%). However, an insurance company would exercise voting rights attributable to any shares of each Fund that it owns (directly or indirectly) in accordance, and in proportion to, voting instructions received by owners of the Variable Contracts. A small number of Contract Holders could therefore determine whether Fund proposals are approved. 
As of the Record Date, LVIP was aware that the following persons or entities owned of record 25% or more of the outstanding shares of each share class of a Fund.

For these Funds, the insurance companies include, without limitation, (1) Lincoln Life, an Indiana insurance company, at 1300 South Clinton Street, Fort Wayne, IN 46802; (2) Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (Lincoln New York), a New York insurance company, at 100 Madison Street, Suite 1860, Syracuse, NY 13202-2802; and (3) other third party insurance companies. 
As of November 28, 2018 ("Record Date"), there were no shareholders of the Funds that held 5% or more (or 25% or more) of a fund's outstanding shares, except for the insurance company shareholders. Any fund of funds would exercise voting rights attributable to ownership of shares of the LVIP funds in accordance with the proxy voting policies established by the fund of funds. The fund of funds generally will vote their shares of underlying funds in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the underlying fund's shares, a technique known as "echo voting." 
As of the Record Date, LVIP was aware that the following persons or entities owned of record 5% or more of the outstanding shares of each share class of a Fund.
