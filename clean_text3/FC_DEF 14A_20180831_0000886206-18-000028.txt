PROXY STATEMENT                                        
Annual Meeting of ShareholdersJanuary 25, SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
This Proxy Statement is being made available to the shareholders of Franklin Covey Co., a Utah corporation (us, our, we,         FranklinCovey, or the Company), in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors (the Board or Board of Directors) of the Company of proxies from holders of outstanding shares of our Common Stock, $0.05 par value per share (the Common         Stock), for use at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Friday, January 25, 2019, at 8:30 a.m., at the Hyrum W. Smith Auditorium, 2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331, and at any adjournment or postponement         thereof.  This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and the accompanying form of proxy are first being mailed to shareholders of the Company on or about December 21, 2018.
PURPOSE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING
Shareholders of the Company will consider and vote on the following proposals: (i) to elect eight directors to serve until         the next annual meeting; (ii) to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation; (iii) to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP (Deloitte) as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019;         (iv) to approve the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2019 Incentive Plan); and (v) to transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.
COSTS OF SOLICITATION
We will bear all costs and expenses relating to the solicitation of proxies, including the costs of preparation, assembly,         printing, and mailing to shareholders this Proxy Statement and accompanying materials.  In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mails, our directors, officers, and employees, without receiving additional compensation, may solicit         proxies personally or by telephone, facsimile, or electronic mail.  Arrangements will be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the shares         of Common Stock held by such persons, and we will reimburse such brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith. INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING
Who can vote?
The only voting securities that we have outstanding are shares of our Common Stock.  Our Board of Directors has fixed the         close of business on Friday, November 30, 2018 as the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting (the Record Date).  Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record         Date are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  As of the Record Date, there were 13,918,540 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding.  The holders of record of the shares of our Common Stock on the Record Date are entitled to cast one         vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting.
What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a "street name" holder?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Zions Bank, our stock transfer agent, you are considered a         shareholder of record with respect to those shares.  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, but not the shareholder of record, and your shares are         held in "street name."  You are entitled to vote your shares whether you are the shareholder of record or you hold the shares in street name.
How can you vote?
You may submit your proxy by mail, telephone, or the Internet.  If you are submitting your proxy by mail, you should         complete, sign, and date your proxy card and return it in the envelope provided.  Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card.  If you plan to vote by telephone or the Internet, voting instructions are printed on your proxy card.  If you         hold your shares through an account with a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, please follow the instructions you receive from them to vote your shares.  If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as you have         instructed.  Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by our voting tabulator no later than January 24, 2019 to be voted at the Annual Meeting.  You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting.
What if I do not specify on my proxy card how I want my shares voted?
Shares of Common Stock which are entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting and which are represented by properly executed         proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on such proxies.  If no instructions are indicated, such shares will be voted (i) FOR         the election of each of the eight director nominees (Proposal No. 1); (ii) FOR the proposal regarding an advisory vote on executive         compensation (Proposal No. 2); (iii) FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accountants for         the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 3); (iv) FOR the approval of the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Proposal         No. 4); and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.  It is not currently anticipated that any other matters will be presented at         the Annual Meeting.
How do I vote at the Annual Meeting?
You may vote in person by written ballot at the Annual Meeting.  However, if your shares are held in street name, you must         bring a legal proxy or other proof from that broker, trust, bank, or other nominee of your beneficial ownership of those shares as of the record date in order to vote at the Annual Meeting.  If you vote by proxy and also attend the Annual Meeting,         you do not need to vote again at the Annual Meeting. If my shares are held in street name, will my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares for me?
No.  If you hold your shares in street name and do not give voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee,         then your broker, bank, or other nominee may only vote your shares with respect to "discretionary" matters, but may not vote your shares with respect to "non-discretionary" matters.  Each of our proposals, except for Proposal No. 3, the         ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, are considered "non-discretionary" matters.  As a result, if you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank, or other nominee will not have discretion to         vote your shares at the Annual Meeting if you do not provide voting instructions.  Accordingly, it is important that street name holders give instructions to their broker, bank, or other nominee by following the voting instructions received from         their broker, banker, or other nominee.
May I revoke my vote prior to the Annual Meeting?
Yes.  A shareholder who has completed a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its exercise at the Annual Meeting by         returning a proxy bearing a later date, by filing with the Secretary of the Company, at the address set forth below, a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy being revoked, or by voting the Common Stock covered thereby in         person at the Annual Meeting.
What is a Quorum?
A quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding as         of the close of business on the Record Date.  A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Annual Meeting.  Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be included in determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting.  Holders of common         stock will vote as a single class.  If there are not sufficient shares represented for a quorum, then the Annual Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is established.
What Vote is Required for a Proposal to be Approved?
Unless a nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" or "against" than votes "for" such nominee, the eight         nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them, up to the eight directors to be elected by those shares, will be elected as directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and         until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors.
Pursuant to the Company's bylaws, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" or "against"         from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election shall immediately offer to tender his or her resignation following certification of such shareholder vote.  The Nominating Committee shall promptly consider the director's resignation         offer and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the offer.  The Board of Directors shall act on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days following         certification of the shareholder vote.
Approval of Proposal No. 2, the advisory vote on executive compensation, requires that the number of votes cast in favor         of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition.  Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal. The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accountants (Proposal No. 3) requires         that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Approval of the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which is Proposal No. 4, requires the number of votes cast         in favor of the plan to exceed the number of votes cast against this proposal.  Abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as votes against the plan.  Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this         proposal.
What are the Board's voting recommendations?
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" proposal nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, as further described in this Proxy Statement.
What are broker non-votes?
When a broker, bank, or other nominee has discretion to vote on one or more proposals at a meeting but does not have         discretion to vote on other matters at the meeting, the broker, bank, or other nominee will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the "non-discretionary" matters with respect to shares held for beneficial         owners which did not provide voting instructions with respect to the "non-discretionary" matters.  This situation is commonly referred to as a "broker non-vote."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Nominees for Election to the Board of Directors
Our Board currently consists of eight directors, six of whom are considered independent.  Each of the directors standing         for election will serve a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders.  At the Annual Meeting, proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of individuals than the eight nominees named in this Proxy Statement.
Our directors have significant experience with our business and are familiar with the risks and competition we face, which         allow them to participate actively and effectively in Board and committee discussions and deliberations.  Our directors meet and speak frequently with each other and with members of our senior management team.  These formal meetings and informal         discussions occur based on the needs of our business and the market environment.
The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the Nominating Committee) and the Board believe the skills,         qualities, attributes, and experiences of its directors provide the Company with the business acumen and range of perspectives to engage each other and management to effectively address our evolving needs and represent the best interests of our         shareholders.  In addition, the Board firmly believes that the experience, attributes, and skills of any single director should not be viewed in isolation, but rather in the context of the experience, attributes, and skills that all director         nominees bring to the Board as a whole, each of whom contributes to the function of an effective Board.  The biographies below describe the skills, qualities, attributes, and experiences of each of the nominees that led the Board to determine that         it is appropriate to nominate these directors for re-election.

Corporate Governance
FranklinCovey upholds a set of basic values and principles to guide our actions, and we are committed to maintaining the         highest standards of business conduct and corporate governance.  Our emphasis on corporate governance begins at the top, with our directors, who are elected by, and are accountable to you, our shareholders.  This commitment to governance extends to         our management team and to all of our employees.  We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for our directors, officers, and senior financial officers that include the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and         other members of our financial leadership team.  The Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are available on our website at www.franklincovey.com.               In addition, each of the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are available in print free of charge to any shareholder by making a written request to Investor Relations, Franklin Covey Co., 2200 West Parkway         Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331.  The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all directors, officers, and employees of FranklinCovey.
A feature of our corporate governance is that our standing committees are comprised of independent directors, as discussed         below.  We believe this structure allows for a collective focus by a majority of our independent directors on the various complex matters that come before Board committees.  The overlap inherent in this structure assists these independent directors         in the execution of their responsibilities.
Board Oversight
Our Board is responsible for and committed to the independent oversight of the business and affairs of our Company,         including financial performance, CEO performance, succession planning, strategy, risk management, and compensation.  In carrying out this responsibility, our Board advises our CEO and other members of our senior management team to help drive         success for our clients and long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Affirmative Determination Regarding Board Independence
The Board of Directors has determined each of the following directors to be an "independent director" under the listing         standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE):  Anne H. Chow, Clayton M. Christensen, Michael Fung, Dennis G. Heiner, Donald J. McNamara, and E. Kay Stepp.
In assessing the independence of the directors, the Board of Directors determines whether or not any director has a         material relationship with us (either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us).  The Board of Directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances in making independence         determinations, including the director independence standards adopted by the Board of Directors and the existence of related party transactions as described in the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" found in this         report.
Board Leadership Structure
Under our current leadership structure, we have a combined position of Chairman and CEO and an independent director         serving as a Lead Independent Director.  The Board of Directors does not have a policy on whether the roles of Chairman and CEO should be separate or combined.  Our Board assesses these roles and deliberates the merits of its leadership structure         to ensure that the most efficient and appropriate structure is in place.  In addition, our Board has determined that if the Chairman is not an independent director, then there should also be a Lead Independent Director.
Our Board believes that combining the roles of Chairman and CEO is currently the most effective leadership structure for         our Company.  Combining these roles ensures that our Company has a single leader who speaks with one voice to our shareholders, clients, employees, regulators, other stakeholders, and to the broader public.  Our current CEO, Mr. Whitman, has         significant knowledge of, and experience in, our business, industry, operations, and risks, which affords him the insight necessary to guide discussions at Board meetings.  Mr. Whitman also provides our Board with updates on significant business         developments and other time-sensitive matters.
As CEO, Mr. Whitman is directly accountable to our Board and, through our Board, to our shareholders.  His role as         Chairman is both counterbalanced and enhanced by the overall independence of the Board and independent leadership provided by our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Heiner.  Mr. Heiner, as Chairman of our Nominating Committee, was designated as the         Lead Independent Director by our Board.  Our independent directors may elect another independent director as Lead Independent Director at any time.  Mr. Whitman and Mr. Heiner meet and speak frequently regarding our Board and our Company. The Board of Director's Role in Risk Management Oversight
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has responsibility for the oversight of risk management, while our         management team is responsible for the day-to-day risk management process.  With the oversight of the Board of Directors, management has developed an enterprise risk management strategy, whereby management identifies the top individual risks that         we face with respect to our business, operations, strategy, and other factors that were recognized after discussions with key business and functional leaders and reviews of external information.  In addition to evaluating various key risks,         management identifies ways to manage and mitigate such risks.  During fiscal 2018, management met regularly with the Audit Committee to discuss the identified risks and the efforts that are designed to mitigate and manage these risks.  These risks         are allocated to the various committees of the Board of Directors to allow the committees to examine a particular risk in detail and assess its potential impact to our operations.  For example, the Audit Committee reviews compliance and risk         management processes and practices related to accounting and financial reporting matters; the Nominating Committee reviews the risks related to succession planning and the independence of the Board of Directors; and the Organization and         Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) reviews the risks related to our various compensation plans.  In the event that a committee is allocated responsibility for examining and analyzing a specific risk, such committee reports on the         relevant risk exposure during its regular reports to the entire Board of Directors.
As part of its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee periodically reviews our compensation policies and programs to         ensure that the compensation programs offer appropriate performance incentives for employees, including executive officers, while mitigating excessive risk taking.  We believe that our various compensation programs contain provisions that         discourage excessive risk taking.  These provisions include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An appropriate balance between annual cash compensation and equity compensation that may be earned over several                    years.  
• Metrics that are weighted between the achievement of overall financial goals and individual objectives.  
• Stock ownership guidelines that encourage executive officers to accumulate meaningful levels of equity                    ownership, which align the interests of executives with those of long-term shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
Based on a review of the nature of our operations by the Compensation Committee, we do not believe that any areas of the         Company are incented to take excessive risks that would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations.
BOARD OF DIRECTOR COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS
Our Board has three standing committees: Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, and Organization and Compensation.          The specific membership of each committee allows us to take advantage of our directors' diverse skill sets, which enables deep focus on committee matters. The following table shows the current membership of each of our committees.

The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee functions on behalf of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  The Audit Committee's primary functions are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr. Fung, and each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent as described         under NYSE rules and meets the enhanced independence standards established by Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  The Board of Directors has determined that one of the Audit Committee members, Michael Fung, is an "audit committee         financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. The Nominating Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is chaired by Mr. Heiner.  The primary purposes of the Nominating         Committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommend individuals for nomination, election, or appointment as members of our Board and its committees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
In carrying out the responsibilities of the Nominating Committee, Mr. Heiner frequently met or had discussions with our         CEO during the fiscal year.  All of the members of the Nominating Committee are "independent" as defined under NYSE rules.
The Organization and Compensation Committee
We are in a business that relies heavily on our people for a competitive advantage.  As a result, our Organization and         Compensation Committee plays a pivotal role in enabling us to attract and retain the best talent for the growth and strategic needs of our Company.
The Compensation Committee is chaired by Ms. Stepp and regularly met without any employees present to discuss executive         compensation matters, including Mr. Whitman's compensation package, during fiscal 2018.  The primary functions of the Compensation Committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determine and approve the compensation of our CEO and other executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and make recommendations to the Board for any incentive compensation and equity-based plans that are                    subject to Board approval;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assist our Board in its oversight of the development, implementation, and effectiveness of our policies and                    strategies relating to our human capital management, including recruiting, retention, career development and progression, diversity, and employment practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 All of the Compensation Committee members are "independent" as defined under the NYSE enhanced independence standards.  As         described below in "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions," none of the Compensation Committee members had any material business relationships with the Company.
The Compensation Committee administers all elements of our executive compensation program, including our stock-based         long-term incentive plans.  In consultation with the Compensation Committee, Mr. Whitman annually reviews and establishes compensation for the other Named Executive Officers (as defined below).  The Compensation Committee regularly reports to the         full Board on decisions related to the executive compensation program.
Compensation Consultants
Within its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside advisors, experts, and         others to assist the committee.  During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Mercer as compensation consultants.  These compensation consultants provided information to the Compensation Committee regarding stock-based compensation plans,         executive compensation, and director compensation that were used as components of the overall mix of information used to evaluate our compensation plans.  The Compensation Committee reviewed its relationship with Mercer and has determined that its         work has not raised any conflicts of interest.  Further information regarding the role of these compensation consultants can be found in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee was or is an officer or employee of the Company or any of our subsidiaries.

[END TABLE]
In addition to the formal meetings shown above, our Board regularly participated in informal update calls with members of         our executive management throughout fiscal 2018.
Our Lead Independent Director plays an active role on our Board of Directors.  Mr. Heiner reviews the agenda, schedule,         and materials for each Board and Nominating Committee meeting and presides over executive sessions of the independent directors.  Any independent director may call for an executive session and suggest agenda items for Board or committee meetings.
All of the members of our Board of Directors were able to attend at least 75 percent of the Board and committee meetings         for which they were entitled to participate except for Ms. Chow who was unable to attend some committee meetings due to scheduling conflicts and her significant responsibilities, including client commitments, associated with her current         employment.  Although we encourage Board members to attend our Annual Meeting, we do not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual shareholder meetings.  Six members of our Board of Directors attended our most recent annual         meeting of shareholders, which was held in January 2018. Director Nomination Process
As indicated above, the Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the director nomination process.  The         Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating candidates for membership on the Board of Directors and recommending to the Board of Directors nominees to stand for election.  Each candidate to serve on the Board of Directors         must be able to fulfill the responsibilities for directors set out in the Corporate Governance Guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.  These Corporate Governance Guidelines may be found on our website at www.franklincovey.com.  In addition to the qualifications set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, nominees for director will be selected on the basis of such attributes as their         integrity, experience, achievements, judgment, intelligence, personal character, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties, and the likelihood that he or she will be able to serve on the         Board for a sustained period.  In connection with the selection of nominees for director, consideration will be given to the Board's overall balance of diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences.  We believe it is important to have an         appropriate mix of diversity for the optimal functionality of the Board of Directors.  Although we do not have a formal diversity policy relating to the identification and evaluation of nominees for director, the Nominating Committee considers all         of the criteria described above in identifying and selecting nominees and in the future may establish additional minimum criteria for nominees.
Although not an automatically disqualifying factor, the inability of a director candidate to meet independence standards         of the NYSE will weigh negatively in any assessment of a candidate's suitability.
The Nominating Committee intends to use a variety of means of identifying nominees for director, including outside search         firms, recommendations from current Board members, and recommendations from shareholders.  In determining whether to nominate a candidate, the Nominating Committee will consider the current composition and capabilities of serving Board members, as         well as additional capabilities considered necessary or desirable in light of existing Company needs and then assess the need for new or additional members to provide those capabilities.
Unless well known to one or more members of the Nominating Committee, normally at least one member of the Nominating         Committee will interview a prospective candidate who is identified as having high potential to satisfy the expectations, requirements, qualities, and capabilities for Board membership.
Shareholder Nominations
The Nominating Committee, which is responsible for the nomination of candidates for appointment or election to the Board         of Directors, will consider, but shall not be required to nominate, candidates recommended by our shareholders who beneficially own at the time of the recommendation not less than one percent of our outstanding stock (Qualifying Shareholders).
Generally speaking, the manner in which the Nominating Committee evaluates nominees for director recommended by a         Qualifying Shareholder will be the same as for nominees from other nominating sources.  However, the Nominating Committee will seek and consider information concerning the relationship between a Qualifying Shareholder's nominee and that Qualifying         Shareholder to determine whether the nominee can effectively represent the interests of all shareholders.
Qualifying Shareholders wishing to make recommendations to the Nominating Committee for its consideration may do so by         submitting a written recommendation, including detailed information on the proposed candidate, including education, professional experience, and expertise, via mail addressed as follows:

c/o Stephen D. Young, Corporate Secretary
2200 West Parkway Boulevard
Salt Lake City, UT  84119- Contractual Rights of Knowledge Capital to Designate Nominees
Under the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement dated March 8, 2005, between Knowledge Capital and the Company, we         are obligated to nominate one designee of Knowledge Capital for election to the Board of Directors.  Donald J. McNamara, a current member of our Board of Directors, is the designee of Knowledge Capital pursuant to this agreement.  Upon the mutual         agreement of the Company and Knowledge Capital, Robert A. Whitman, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, does not currently serve as a designee of Knowledge Capital.  To the extent requested by Knowledge Capital, we are obligated at each meeting         of our shareholders at which directors are elected to cause the Knowledge Capital designee to be nominated for election and will solicit proxies in favor of such nominee and vote all management proxies in favor of such nominee except for proxies         that specifically are voted to the contrary.
The Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement also provides that we are obligated, if requested by Knowledge Capital,         and to the extent permitted by law and applicable rules of the NYSE, to ensure that at least one designee of Knowledge Capital is a member of all committees of the Board other than any special committee of directors formed as a result of any         conflict of interest arising from any Knowledge Capital designee's relationship with Knowledge Capital.  Knowledge Capital has not requested that its designee serve on any committees of the Board and Donald J. McNamara does not currently serve on         any Board committees.
Communications with Directors
Shareholders or other interested parties wishing to communicate directly with the Board of Directors or the non-management         directors as a group, may contact the Lead Independent Director directly via e-mail at lead.director@franklincovey.com.  Our audit committee chairman may also be         contacted directly via e-mail at audit.committee@franklincovey.com.  You may also contact members of the Board in writing by addressing the correspondence to that         individual or group, c/o Stephen D. Young, Corporate Secretary, Franklin Covey Co., 2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331.  All such written communications will initially be received and processed by the office of the         Corporate Secretary.  Depending on the nature of the correspondence, the Secretary or Assistant Secretary will initially review such correspondence and either (i) immediately forward the correspondence to the indicated director and to the Chair of         the Nominating Committee, or (ii) hold for review during the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors.
Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation
Director compensation is set by the Organization and Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.  The         Company's management does not play a role in setting Board Compensation.  We compensate members of the Board of Directors using a combination of cash and equity-based compensation.  Robert A. Whitman, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO,         does not currently receive compensation for his service as a director.  The compensation received by Mr. Whitman for his role as Chairman and CEO is shown in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table, contained in the Executive Compensation         section of this proxy statement. In fiscal 2018, the other directors were paid the following amounts for services provided:

The following table sets forth information as of October 31, 2018, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of         Common Stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our Common Stock, by each director, by the Named Executive Officers, and by all directors and officers as a group.  Unless noted otherwise, each person         named has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated.  In computing the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by a person or entity and the percentage ownership of that person or entity, we deemed         outstanding shares of Common Stock subject to options held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 31, 2018.  We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing         the percentage ownership of any other person or entity.  The percentages set forth below have been computed without taking into account treasury shares held by us and are based on 13,918,219 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of October 31,         2018.  At the date of this report, there were no shares of Series A or B Preferred Stock outstanding.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our Board and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10 percent of         our common stock, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Common Stock and other securities which are derivative of the Common Stock.  Executive officers, directors         and holders of more than 10 percent of our Common Stock are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all such reports they file.  Based upon a review of the copies of such forms received by us and information furnished by the         persons named above, we believe that all reports were filed on a timely basis during fiscal 2018.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions
We review all relationships and transactions in which the Company and certain related persons, including our directors,         Named Executive Officers, and their immediate family members, are participants, to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest.  Our legal and accounting departments have responsibility for the development and         implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from the directors and Named Executive Officers with respect to related party transactions and for then determining, based upon the facts and circumstances, whether the Company or a         related party has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction.  As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to us or the related party are disclosed in our Proxy Statement.  In         addition, a disinterested majority of the full Board of Directors or Audit Committee reviews and approves any related party transaction that is required to be disclosed. Related Party Transactions
We previously acquired CoveyLink Worldwide, LLC (CoveyLink).  CoveyLink conducts seminars and training courses and         provides consulting based upon the book The Speed of Trust by Stephen M.R. Covey, who is the brother of M. Sean Covey.  Prior to the         acquisition date, CoveyLink had granted us a non-exclusive license related to The Speed of Trust book and related training courses for which we         paid CoveyLink specified royalties.  As part of the CoveyLink acquisition, an amended and restated license of intellectual property was signed that granted us an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, transferable, royalty-bearing license to use,         reproduce, display, distribute, sell, prepare derivative works of, and perform the licensed material in any format or medium and through any market or distribution channel.  The amount expensed for these royalties due to Stephen M.R. Covey under         the amended and restated license agreement totaled $1.8 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.  In connection with the CoveyLink acquisition, we also signed a speaking services agreement that pays Stephen M.R. Covey a portion of the         speaking revenues received for his presentations.  During fiscal 2018 we expensed $0.9 million for these presentations.
We pay M. Sean Covey, who is also an executive officer of the Company, a percentage of the royalty proceeds received from         the sales of certain books authored by him in addition to his salary.  During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, we expensed $0.2 million for these royalty payments.
In fiscal 2018, we employed Joshua M.R. Covey, who is the brother of M. Sean Covey, and paid him compensation totaling         $207,959.  We also employed Dr. John Covey, an uncle of M. Sean Covey, and paid him compensation totaling $103,461 during fiscal 2018.
During fiscal 2018 we employed Doug Puzey, who is an uncle of Paul S. Walker, and paid him compensation totaling         $418,317.  We employ John Harding, who is the brother-in-law of Stephen D. Young, and paid him compensation totaling $292,918 in fiscal 2018.
We employ Curtis Bateman, who is Shawn D. Moon's brother-in-law, and paid him compensation totaling $494,919 during fiscal         2018.  Mr. Bateman also received a long-term incentive equity award with a fair value of $25,000 during fiscal 2018, or 1,299 shares.  None of these shares vested to Mr. Bateman during fiscal 2018.  In fiscal 2017 we paid Curtis Garbett, who is         also a brother-in-law to Shawn D. Moon, compensation totaling $288,142.  Mr. Moon left his full-time role with the Company in September 2017.
Robert A. Whitman, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, beneficially owns a partnership interest in Knowledge         Capital.  Donald J. McNamara, a member of our Board of Directors, also beneficially owns a partnership interest in Knowledge Capital.  Knowledge Capital beneficially owns 2,812,805 shares of our Common Stock at October 31, 2018.
Each of these listed transactions was approved according to the procedures cited above. COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Our Compensation Committee, composed of four independent directors, determined the fiscal 2018 compensation for our             named executive officers (NEOs):
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Robert A. Whitman –                        Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO)   
· Stephen D. Young – Chief                        Financial Officer (CFO)   
· M. Sean Covey –                        Executive Vice President for Global Solutions and Partnerships   
· Paul S. Walker –                        Executive Vice President for Global Sales and Delivery    
· Scott J. Miller –                        Executive Vice President for Global Business Development and Marketing   
[END TABLE]
The material elements of our executive compensation programs and policies, including program objectives, reasons for             paying each element and the specific amounts of our NEOs' compensation for fiscal 2018, are explained below.  Following this description, you will find a series of tables containing more specific information about our NEOs' compensation.  We             begin with an executive summary to provide a framework for analysis of this information.
Executive Summary
Overview
The Company's multi-year transition from selling engagement-by-engagement training and performance solutions to selling             training and performance solutions delivered through a subscription-based business model continued in fiscal 2018.  Our new subscription-based business model:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   provides clients with unlimited access to Franklin Covey's entire collection of best-in-class content for a defined population;   
 (2)   can be delivered through an almost unlimited combination of delivery modalities;   
 (3)   includes the services of an implementation specialist to help clients design "impact journeys" to help them achieve their                        performance objectives; and   
 (4)   offers a price per population trained that is equivalent to that typically charged in the industry for just a single course in                        a single delivery modality.   
[END TABLE]
We anticipated that this value proposition would be extremely compelling to our customers.  We also expected that it             would be disruptive both to our historical course-by-course business model, and to our financial reporting, since the recognition of a significant portion of the value of contracts sold in a given period would be deferred into future periods,             rather than being recognized in the initial reporting period.
Throughout the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we refer to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, which we believe             is relevant to understanding our results of operations and compensation performance measures.  See Appendix B attached to this proxy statement for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP Net Income (Loss)             for fiscal years 2013 to 2018. Fiscal 2018 Performance
The Company has reached an inflection point where the magnitude and significant growth rate of our subscription             business is increasingly offsetting the historical channels.  As a result, we expect both our reported and economic revenue growth to continue to accelerate in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
Subscription and subscription-related revenue accounts for more than half of the revenue in our English speaking direct             offices, and is expected to substantially increase in the coming years. We expect to be launching our All Access Pass subscription offering (AAP) in China and Japan this coming year.  In addition, the vast majority of our Education business is             now subscription or subscription-related.  The value proposition of our AAP offering is continuing to drive a higher initial sale, a higher rate of revenue renewal, and more add-on sales of services, resulting in a significantly higher lifetime             value of our customers.  This higher lifetime customer value is expected to drive accelerated growth for our subscription model.
Key Compensation Decisions and Actions for Fiscal 2018
The Compensation Committee made the following key executive compensation decisions and took the following key executive             compensation actions for fiscal 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Salaries                        – Fiscal 2018 salaries for our CEO and Mr. Walker were increased based on our analysis of relevant market data, while salaries for all other NEOs remained at the same levels as in fiscal 2017.  
· Annual Incentive Payments                        – Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee approved an annual incentive plan for fiscal 2018 that provided for potential cash incentives based on (1) the annual financial performance of the Company, based on Qualified                        Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in the Analysis of Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions section of this document (70% of payout) and (2) executive team performance objectives (30% of payout).  Based on actual performance,                        the NEOs received 100% payout for target achievement under the Qualified Adjusted EBITDA performance objectives under the fiscal 2018 annual incentive plan.  In addition, the metric-based executive team performance objectives were                        achieved, resulting in 100% payout of the target executive team performance portion of the annual incentive plan for each NEO for fiscal 2018. Further details of our annual incentive plan for fiscal 2018 are explained in the section                        below entitled "Annual Performance-Based Variable Pay."   
· Annual Incentive Payments                        – Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee approved an annual incentive plan for fiscal 2018 that provided for potential cash incentives based on (1) the annual financial performance of the Company, based on Qualified                        Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined in the Analysis of Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions section of this document (70% of payout) and (2) executive team performance objectives (30% of payout).  Based on actual performance,                        the NEOs received 100% payout for target achievement under the Qualified Adjusted EBITDA performance objectives under the fiscal 2018 annual incentive plan.  In addition, the metric-based executive team performance objectives were                        achieved, resulting in 100% payout of the target executive team performance portion of the annual incentive plan for each NEO for fiscal 2018. Further details of our annual incentive plan for fiscal 2018 are explained in the section                        below entitled "Annual Performance-Based Variable Pay."   
· Supplemental Incentive Payment                        – The Company made payments to our NEOs during early fiscal 2018 to compensate for unbilled deferred revenue generated from multi-year contracts entered into with clients in fiscal 2017, for which the revenue was not reported in                        fiscal 2018 results.  Further details of these supplemental payments are provided in the section below entitled "Supplemental Incentive Payments."   
· Supplemental Incentive Payment                        – The Company made payments to our NEOs during early fiscal 2018 to compensate for unbilled deferred revenue generated from multi-year contracts entered into with clients in fiscal 2017, for which the revenue was not reported in                        fiscal 2018 results.  Further details of these supplemental payments are provided in the section below entitled "Supplemental Incentive Payments."   
· Long-Term Incentive Awards                        – Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee granted to each of the NEOs performance-based restricted stock units (RSUs).  However, the Compensation Committee also added service-based RSU awards, and the fiscal 2018                        long-term incentive plan (LTIP) awards of performance-based RSUs have a different vesting schedule and different performance criteria than the LTIP awards granted in previous years.  There are three tranches in the fiscal 2018 LTIP                        awards, including: a time vested tranche that vests after three years; a tranche for Qualified Adjusted EBITDA performance and a tranche for "subscription sales" performance.  The number of shares that vest in each of the Qualified                        Adjusted EBITDA and subscription sale tranches is based on fiscal 2020 financial results.  As of August 31, 2018, all three tranches of the fiscal 2018 RSUs remain unvested.  Further details of the performance-based RSUs granted in                        fiscal 2018 are explained in the section below entitled "Equity Compensation."

The Compensation Committee reviews and considers the views of institutional shareholders and proxy advisory firms on             corporate pay practices.  In this regard, we reach out to key shareholders to solicit their views on executive compensation and consider the results of our annual "say-on-pay" voting.  In order to maintain best practices for compensation, the             Compensation Committee has implemented and maintains the following policies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Clawback Policy – The                        Board has authority to require reimbursement of any annual or long-term incentive payment made to an executive officer where: (1) the payment was based on achieving financial results that were subsequently the subject of a substantial                        restatement of Company financial statements filed with the SEC; (2) the Board determines the executive engaged in misconduct that caused the need for the substantial restatement; and (3) a lower payment would have been made to the                        executive based on the restated financial results.  In such instance, the Company expects that it will seek to recover from the individual executive the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments for the relevant                        period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.

· Hedging Policy – Our                        directors and executive officers are prohibited from trading in publicly traded options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Company stock or debt.  All other employees are discouraged from engaging in hedging                        transactions related to Company stock.   
· Hedging Policy – Our                        directors and executive officers are prohibited from trading in publicly traded options, puts, calls or other derivative instruments related to Company stock or debt.  All other employees are discouraged from engaging in hedging                        transactions related to Company stock.   
· No Repricing Without                          Shareholder Approval – Our equity plans expressly prohibit option repricing without shareholder approval.   
· No Excise Tax Gross-ups                        – Excise tax gross-ups for our NEOs are prohibited.   
· Stock Ownership Guidelines                        – Our stock ownership guidelines require an ownership threshold of five times base salary for our CEO, three times base salary for our CFO and two times base salary for our other NEOs, with each NEO targeted to reach the applicable                        threshold within five years of the policy becoming applicable to the NEO and from the date the NEO first has shares awarded as part of his or her annual compensation.  Unvested share awards are included in calculating whether the                        required threshold has been achieved.  NEOs are prohibited from selling any shares until after these guidelines are met.  The Compensation Committee annually reviews executives' progress toward meeting these guidelines.  Currently,                        the stock ownership of each of our CEO, our CFO and Mr. Covey meets or exceeds the applicable threshold.  Mr. Walker and Mr. Miller are currently expected to meet their ownership thresholds within the allotted time.  In addition, a                        Board policy requires that each director who is not an employee of the Company must maintain beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock and/or fully vested RSUs equal in value to at least four times the Board cash retainer at                        all times during his or her tenure on the Board.  New directors have up to three years of service on the Board in which to meet this ownership requirement.

New directors have up to three years of service on the Board in which to meet this ownership requirement.   
· No Significant Perquisites                        – No significant "corporate perquisites" such as country club memberships or automobile allowances are provided to our NEOs.   
· No Employment Agreements for                          NEOs and Limited Change-in-Control Benefits – The Company does not enter into employment agreements with its NEOs, and has a change-in-control policy for its NEOs that provides for a potential change-in-control severance                        benefit of only one times total targeted annual cash compensation without any excise tax gross-ups.  Our NEOs are subject to the same general (non-change-in-control) severance policies as all Company employees.   
· No Employment Agreements for                          NEOs and Limited Change-in-Control Benefits – The Company does not enter into employment agreements with its NEOs, and has a change-in-control policy for its NEOs that provides for a potential change-in-control severance                        benefit of only one times total targeted annual cash compensation without any excise tax gross-ups.  Our NEOs are subject to the same general (non-change-in-control) severance policies as all Company employees.   
· Pay for Performance – The 2018 performance-based awards were designed to incentivize even greater achievement levels in the Company's results of operations,                        and payout only if these operating improvements are achieved.   
· Efficient Share Utilization – The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's historical share utilization for compensation purposes has been relatively low;                        this utilization is expected to remain relatively low in the future.

Consideration of 2018 "Say-On-Pay" Voting Results
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, we held our annual advisory "say-on-pay" vote with respect to the compensation of our             NEOs.  Over 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the compensation of our NEOs.  Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee considered and discussed this shareholder vote result during fiscal 2018 and determined not to make             significant changes to the existing program for fiscal 2018 specifically as a result of the 2018 say-on-pay vote.  The Compensation Committee will, from time to time, explore various executive pay and corporate governance changes to the extent             appropriate in an effort to keep our executive compensation program aligned with best practices in our competitive market and the company's particular circumstances, and expects to consider shareholder views in so doing.  The Compensation             Committee intends to continue holding say-on-pay votes with shareholders on an annual basis, consistent with our shareholders' recommendation from our 2018 Annual Meeting, and the next such vote is scheduled for the 2019 Annual Meeting. Guiding Philosophy, Principles and Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program
To fulfill our mission and implement our strategy, Franklin Covey must attract, motivate and retain highly qualified             employees.  We achieve this, in part, through working to ensure that we have both a winning culture and a competitive performance-based total compensation program.  We align our executives' interests with those of our shareholders by tying             almost all short- and long-term incentive compensation to the Company's achievement of key measures of growth and profitability.
We believe variable, performance-based compensation should constitute a significant percentage of our executives'             overall compensation opportunity.  All executive base salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentive pay compensation is designed to be market-based, and variable pay and long-term incentive pay is linked to, and designed to reward the             achievement of, specific performance targets.
The philosophy and objectives of our executive compensation program are reflected in the compensation principles listed             below, which guide the Compensation Committee in its oversight of our compensation practices and plans.  The specific objectives of our executive compensation program are to reward achievement of our strategic and annual business plans and to             link a major portion of pay directly to performance.  The key principles that guide the Compensation Committee are that the Company's executive compensation program should:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Reflect Performance: To                        align compensation with performance over both the short and long term, we establish multi-year objectives for the Company relating both to growth and to the achievement of key strategic objectives.  Annual performance targets are                        established in the context of these multi-year objectives, and for fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of goals for growth in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Qualified Adjusted EBITDA.  NEO performance pay levels for the year are generally                        determined by assessing the Company's level of achievement compared to these objectives.  Since our NEOs have responsibility for our overall Company performance against these objectives, their compensation can vary (and has varied)                        significantly from year to year.

Since our NEOs have responsibility for our overall Company performance against these objectives, their compensation can vary (and has varied)                        significantly from year to year.   
· Encourage Long-Term                          Company-Wide Focus: We believe that compensation should encourage and reward both the achievement of annual objectives and longer-term, Company-wide performance improvement.  We utilize a service-based and performance-based                        RSU program to focus NEO efforts on long-term growth in shareholder value.  We believe that paying a significant portion of variable compensation to our NEOs in the form of equity-based compensation that vests over a period of time,                        based on performance, also encourages a long-term, Company-wide focus.  Value is realized through delivering results today, but in a way that builds the foundation for delivering even stronger results in the future.  We believe that                        this practice will lead to our NEOs having a considerable investment in our shares over time.  This investment in turn advances both a culture of teamwork and partnership, and encourages a stewardship mentality for the Company among                        our key leaders.

· Attract and Retain Talent:                        We believe that we understand the importance of hiring and retaining the best people.  Retention of talented employees is critical to successfully executing our business strategy.  We seek to be what we refer to internally as "the                        workplace of choice for achievers with heart."  Successful execution of our business strategy requires that our management team be in place, engaged and focusing their best energy and talents on achieving our business goals and                        strategies.  For us, compensation is not just an overhead expense; it is a key component of the investments we make and costs we incur to generate our revenues.  For our delivery consultants, a portion of this compensation cost is                        reflected as cost of goods sold.  In determining the compensation of our NEOs and in reviewing the effectiveness of our compensation program for attracting and retaining talent, the Compensation Committee generally considers the                        competitive market for talent.  We believe that our compensation programs should enable us to attract and retain talented people, and incentivize them to contribute their finest talents to achieving our objectives.  We are pleased                        that our executive officers have an average tenure of over 22 years with our Company (ranging from 17 to 33 years).

[END TABLE]
 In addition to aligning our compensation programs with the achievement of objectives that drive shareholder value, the             Compensation Committee also considers the consistency of our compensation programs and works to ensure that our variable compensation does not encourage imprudent risk-taking.  We have determined that our Company's approach to the compensation             process addresses the need to balance prudence and pay-for-performance through a combination of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Controls on the allocation and overall management of risk-taking;   
· Comprehensive profit and loss and other management information, that provides ongoing performance feedback;  
· Rigorous, multi-party performance assessments and compensation decisions; and   
· A Company-wide compensation structure that strives to meet industry best practice standards, including a business model that is                        based on compensating our associates in direct proportion to the revenue and profit-contribution they generate.   
[END TABLE]
Our compensation framework seeks to balance risk and reward.  Our executive team is involved in identifying relevant             risks and performance metrics for our business.  We work to create a cadence of accountability within our organization through continuous evaluation and measurement of performance compared to what we refer to internally as our "Wildly Important             Goals" of achieving profitable growth, meeting strategic objectives and building a winning culture.  Based on the considerations discussed above, in connection with its compensation decisions for fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee             concluded that our Company's compensation program and policies are structured such that they do not encourage imprudent risk-taking, and that there are no risks arising from such programs and policies that are reasonably likely to have a             material adverse effect on the Company.
2018 Executive Compensation Program
Our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program incorporated five main elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Base salary;   
· Short-term, performance-based variable pay plan;   
· Long-term incentive equity awards in the form of ongoing service-based and performance-based RSUs;   
· Other benefits (primarily insurance, as discussed below) that are generally available to all employees on similar terms, except                        as specifically described below; and   
· Severance and change-in-control benefits, which are substantially the same for our NEOs as they are for other employees.   
[END TABLE]
Analysis of Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions
Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Determination Process
The Compensation Committee determined the form and amount of fixed compensation and established specific performance             metrics for determining year-end variable compensation to be awarded to our NEOs for fiscal 2018 considering: (1) our financial performance over the prior year and past several years and expectations for fiscal 2018; (2) the individual and             collective performance of our NEOs relative to the achievement of metric-based strategic objectives related to growth in our key practice areas; and (3) in connection with our goal of attracting and retaining             the best talent, a general understanding of market compensation practices.  In particular, the Compensation Committee reviewed at a general level the following financial metrics and related growth rates in connection with making its key             compensation decisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Revenue;   
· Adjusted EBITDA and operating income;   
· Multi-year changes in operating income, Adjusted EBITDA and specific revenue targets; and   
· Achieving high rates of retention for subscription-based revenue.   
[END TABLE]
Management Input               Regarding Compensation Decisions: Our Compensation Committee meets in executive session to discuss the performance of our CEO and each of the other NEOs.  Our CEO submitted year-end variable compensation calculations (certified by our             CFO) and recommendations to the Committee for our other NEOs.  These calculations and recommendations precisely followed the payout guidelines established for incentive compensation relating to financial performance.
Market Assessment:             Our Compensation Committee evaluates our NEO compensation program at a high level against market practices. In 2018, the Committee asked Mercer, the Committee's compensation consultant, to assess our NEO compensation program, identify             considerations that could inform compensation decisions and advise as to current market practices, trends and plan designs. Mercer reviewed data from its own research and databases and used this information primarily as supplemental data to             assist the Compensation Committee in understanding current market practices related to executive compensation, and not for specific or mathematical benchmarking.  In its assessment of our compensation program, Mercer confirmed that the             compensation amounts are consistent with market compensation for similar-sized and comparable professional services and content companies, and that the program has been aligned with corporate performance.  Further, Mercer advised that the             compensation program contains features that reinforce significant alignment with shareholders and a long-term focus, and blends subjective assessment and policies in a way that addresses known and perceived risks.
The Compensation Committee has assessed Mercer's independence, as required under NYSE rules and considered and assessed             all relevant factors, including those required by the SEC that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest during fiscal 2018.  The Compensation Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest raised by the work performed by             Mercer.
In making pay decisions for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee considered how executive compensation should drive             desired performance toward our business objectives.  The Compensation Committee also took into consideration the specific business opportunities and challenges facing the Company compared to those of our competitors and similar sized             companies.  However, the Compensation Committee did not specifically benchmark elements of compensation when making its fiscal 2018 executive compensation decisions.  Finally, the Compensation Committee generally considered the past performance             of our NEOs, including performance against previous individual and corporate objectives, expected contribution to future corporate objectives and whether the NEOs' performance was achieved consistent with our governing values.  The Compensation             Committee made final judgments regarding the appropriate compensation level for each NEO based on these additional inputs.
The following peer group was used for fiscal 2018.  These companies were selected based on size, industry and types of             professional services offered.  Annual revenues for the peer group (which is one of several factors considered in selecting the peers) range from approximately $163 million to $767 million.  The data for this peer group was discounted due to             the overall revenue of the peer group, to be more comparable with our revenue.  Since our fiscal 2018 revenues totaled $209.8 million, we believe with the previously stated discounts, this peer group is appropriate for comparison purposes.              This peer group is one of many tools used by the Compensation Committee for assessing executive compensation.  The peer group companies for fiscal 2018 were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Cambium Learning Group, Inc.   
· CRA International Inc.   
· Exponent Inc.   
· Forrester Research Inc.   
· GP Strategies Corporation

 As compared to the peer group for fiscal 2017, this peer group added Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc. and           Cambium Learning Group, Inc. and eliminated The Advisory Board Company and Callidus Software Inc. based on application of the criteria described above.
Decisions on Key Elements of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation
Total Compensation: In              addition to the specific elements of compensation discussed below, we establish annual targets for the total compensation provided to our NEOs.  Based on the key factors described above, the Compensation Committee established fiscal 2018 total           compensation targets of approximately $2.7 million for our CEO and approximately $942,000, on average, for our other NEOs, assuming achievement of targeted results under our short and long-term performance-based variable pay plans. The           calculation excludes book royalty payments made to Mr. Covey as noted in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
Total Compensation Mix:           The following charts identify the fiscal 2018 target compensation mix for our CEO and average mix for our other NEOs.
Base Salaries
The Company pays a base salary to each of our NEOs to provide a base level of fixed income for services rendered. The           Compensation Committee annually reviews base salary market data and if appropriate, will increase base salaries to remain at competitive levels. Based primarily on the Compensation Committee's subjective consideration of the 2018 market data,           salaries for our CEO and Mr. Walker were increased, with salaries of all other NEOs remaining at the same levels as in effect in fiscal 2017. The Committee continues to emphasize performance-based variable pay as the means by which NEOs may           increase their total compensation.
Annual Performance-Based Variable Pay
Fiscal 2018             Performance-Based Cash Variable Pay Plan: The Company provides annual performance-based cash incentive opportunities to link our NEOs compensation interests to specific financial and strategic goals established by the Compensation           Committee.  In fiscal 2018, the Performance-Based Cash Variable Pay Plan (STIP) for our NEOs included two components for the payout           calculation: (1) Company annual financial performance objectives (70% of payout) and (2) metric-based executive team performance objectives (30% of payout).  The target STIP payout opportunities for our NEOs were determined by the Compensation           Committee based on the considerations described above as follows: $575,000 for Mr. Whitman; $235,000 for Mr. Young and $200,000 for each of Mr. Covey, Mr. Walker, and Mr. Miller.  Mr. Whitman's target STIP payout opportunity increased by $50,000           from fiscal 2017 to match his base salary increase for fiscal 2018; otherwise, the target STIP payout opportunities remained the same for our NEOs from fiscal 2017.  The STIP reinforces our strong pay-for-performance philosophy and rewards the           achievement of specific stretch business and financial goals achieved during the fiscal year.
Financial Performance Component:           The financial performance threshold necessary for NEOs to earn 100% of the financial performance component of their target STIP payout opportunity in fiscal 2018 was $12.0 million of Qualified Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as Adjusted           EBITDA as reported and is adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange and STIP expense up to 100% of target.  In fiscal 2018, Qualified Adjusted EBITDA equaled 14.0 million.  Accordingly, the Company achieved the $12.0           million threshold of financial performance as defined (Qualified Adjusted EBITDA), and as a result 100% payout was made for the financial performance component of the fiscal 2018 annual incentive for each of the NEOs.  As further described below,           our NEOs also received a payout of 30% of targeted annual incentive pay for the metric-based executive team performance objectives, based on the degree of achievement of the specified strategic objectives as evaluated by the Compensation           Committee.
The following table shows the potential payouts to our NEOs based on the degree of attainment of fiscal 2018 STIP           Qualified Adjusted EBITDA objectives (and assuming metric-based executive team performance objectives are achieved).

[END TABLE]
As described both in our proxy statement for fiscal 2017 and above, the Company's financial metrics for the STIP in           effect during fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 did not take into account unbilled deferred revenue generated from multi-year contracts entered into with clients during those years that is realized in later fiscal years.  Because this revenue was           deferred, the NEOs did not receive financial performance incentive payouts under the STIP for those years rewarding their performance in achieving this deferred revenue during fiscal 2016, 2017 or 2018.  To create more transparency within the           STIP structure for fiscal 2018 and going forward, the Company modified the applicable financial metric for the NEOs under the STIP (Qualified Adjusted EBITDA) to operate on a reported basis to include only actual billed revenue from fiscal 2018,           and specifically exclude deferred revenue generated in fiscal 2018 that is realized in later fiscal years.
The Company made payments to our NEOs during early fiscal 2018 to reward them for unbilled deferred revenue generated           during fiscal 2017 that did not otherwise contribute toward the NEOs' annual incentive plan payouts for fiscal 2017 (in fact, there was no payout for the financial performance portion of the annual incentive plan for fiscal 2017).  These payments           recognize the NEOs' efforts in achieving fiscal 2017 revenue that was deferred into fiscal 2018 or later years.  The amounts of such payouts for our NEOs were as follows: $367,500 for Mr. Whitman; $164,500 for Mr. Young and $140,000 for each of           Mr. Covey, Mr. Walker and Mr. Miller. Equity Compensation
We believe that the granting of long-term equity awards over the years has created strong alignment of interest between           NEOs and shareholders, as reflected in our strong financial performance from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2018.  The same program and philosophy were reflected in our use of equity awards in fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2018 Long-Term             Incentive Plan (LTIP) – Service-Based and Performance-Based Equity Grants: A significant portion of our NEOs' total targeted compensation for fiscal 2018 was provided in the form of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs that vest           solely upon the achievement of key financial objectives included in our long-term financial plan over a period of years.  If the performance targets are not achieved within the allotted time frame, then the performance-based RSUs are forfeited.
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee granted these service-based and performance-based RSU awards to our NEOs.            Shares may be earned under the RSUs based on three components over a three-year vesting period, ending August 31, 2020, as identified below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   25% of the total RSUs is time vested and in general will vest on August 31, 2020;   
 (2)   70% of the remaining 75% of the total RSUs is based on fiscal 2020 Qualified Adjusted EBITDA performance, as previously defined;                      and   
 (3)   30% of the remaining 75% of the total RSUs is based on fiscal 2020 subscription sales results.   
[END TABLE]
In addition to payout levels for 50%, 100% and 200+% achievement of applicable performance goals, the number of shares           paid in settlement of the RSU tranches with financial targets is a pro-rata calculation between a 50% target and a 100% target, and a different pro-rata calculation between 100% target and 200% target. As of August 31, 2018, all three tranches of           RSUs granted in fiscal 2018 remain unvested. The targets for the RSUs granted in fiscal 2019 are identified below:
Fiscal 2020 Qualified               Adjusted EBITDA
[BEGIN TABLE]
· $18.0 million (50% target);   
· $25.0 million (100% target); and   
· $30.0 million (200% target).   
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2020               Subscription Sales

· $150.0 million (100% target); and   
· $160.0 million (200% target).   
[END TABLE]
We believe that our RSU program aligns a significant portion of our executive compensation with increasing value realized           by our shareholders.  For further information regarding our LTIP awards and other share-based compensation instruments (including applicable performance achievement), please refer to the notes to our financial statements found in our Annual           Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and the footnotes to the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2018 Year-End table that are provided further below.  None of the outstanding RSUs as reported in the fiscal 2017           Compensation Discussion and Analysis were earned during fiscal 2018.  Please see the outstanding equity awards section below for additional details relating to the outstanding awards.
Qualified Retirement             Benefits: Each of our NEOs participates in the Franklin Covey Co. 401(k) Plan, which is our tax-qualified retirement plan available to all eligible U.S. employees.  We match participant contributions dollar-for-dollar on the first 1% of           salary contributed to the 401(k) plan and 50 cents on the dollar for the next 4% of salary contributed.  Our match for executives is the same received by all associates who participate in the 401(k) plan.  Contributions to the 401(k) plan from           highly compensated employees are currently limited to a maximum of 7% of compensation, subject to statutory limits. Other Benefits:           The Compensation Committee evaluated the market competitiveness of the executive benefit package to determine the most critical and essential benefits necessary to retain executives.  Based on information received from Mercer, the Compensation           Committee determined to include executive life insurance for specific NEOs.  In addition, the Company agreed to provide our CEO with supplemental disability insurance after he voluntarily terminated his employment agreement with the Company, and           in consideration of previous years during which our CEO accepted no compensation.  For fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee was provided with the estimated value of these items (which value is included in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation           Table below), and determined, as in prior years, that these amounts were not material in determining our NEOs' fiscal 2018 compensation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Term Life Insurance:                      Franklin Covey provides a portable 20-year term life policy for the CEO and CFO.  The coverage amount is approximately 2.5 times each NEO's target annual cash compensation (base salary plus target performance-based cash variable pay).   
· Supplemental Disability                        Insurance: We provide our CEO with long-term disability insurance which, combined with our current group policy, provides, in the aggregate, monthly long-term disability benefits equal to approximately 75% of his fiscal 2018                      target cash compensation.  Our other NEOs may purchase voluntary supplemental disability insurance at their own expense.   
· Supplemental Disability                        Insurance: We provide our CEO with long-term disability insurance which, combined with our current group policy, provides, in the aggregate, monthly long-term disability benefits equal to approximately 75% of his fiscal 2018                      target cash compensation.  Our other NEOs may purchase voluntary supplemental disability insurance at their own expense.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Our High Deductible Health Plans and Health Savings Accounts administered pursuant to Sections 125 and 223 of the Internal                      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).   
· Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan implemented and administered pursuant to Section 423 of the Code.   
[END TABLE]
Severance Policy:           We have implemented a severance policy to establish, in advance, the appropriate treatment for terminated NEOs and to help ensure market competitiveness.  The severance policy uses the same benefit formula for our NEOs as it uses for all of our           employees.  We do not "gross-up" severance payments to compensate for taxes.  For more information about the terms of the severance policy, see the section below entitled "Executive Compensation – Potential Payments Upon Termination or           Change-in-Control."
Employment Agreements             and Change-in-Control Severance Agreements: We do not have employment agreements with any of our NEOs, but we are a party to change-in-control severance agreements with each of our NEOs.  These agreements are designed to retain our NEOs           in the event a change-in-control transaction is proposed.  In such situations, the change-in-control benefit may alleviate some of the financial and career concerns often associated with a change-in-control, and enable our NEOs to focus on the           proposed transaction.  For more information about the terms of these change-in-control severance agreements, see the section below entitled "Executive Compensation – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control."
Section 162(m):           U.S. federal income tax law generally prohibits us from taking a tax deduction for certain compensation paid in excess of $1 million to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers).  Historically,           compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" could be excluded from this $1 million limit.  This exception has now been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except for certain compensation           arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 for which transition relief is available.  We continue to evaluate the impact of the recent revisions to Section 162(m) of the Code for their potential impact on the Company.  Regardless of that           impact, the Compensation Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise our ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive           talent needed to compete successfully.  Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.  In addition,           because of the uncertainties associated with the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, there can be no assurance that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under           Section 162(m), as in effect prior to 2018, will in fact be deductible.

Salary: The           amounts reported in the "Salary" column for fiscal 2018 represent base salaries paid to each NEO for fiscal 2018. The targeted annual salary rate for Mr. Whitman increased during the year from $525,000 to $575,000 and the targeted annual salary           rate for Mr. Walker increased from $309,500 to $400,000.
Bonus: The           amounts reported in the "Bonus" column for fiscal 2018 represent the supplemental incentive payments provided to the NEOs in early fiscal 2018 with respect to recognition of deferred revenue created through the execution of multi-year contracts           with our clients in fiscal 2017, which was not billed until fiscal 2018 or will not be billed until later fiscal years. These supplemental payments were calculated using the same formula as was used for prior year's payouts.  These payments are           discussed above in the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Analysis of Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions."
Stock Awards: The              amounts reported in the "Stock Awards" column for fiscal 2018 represent the aggregate grant date fair value (computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or ASC Topic 718), based on           the probable outcome of any applicable performance conditions, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures, for the RSUs granted to NEOs as LTIP awards during fiscal 2018.  The probable outcome of the RSUs granted during fiscal 2018 with           performance conditions were based on the Company meeting the 100% target for both tranches with financial performance conditions (in other words, fiscal 2020 Qualified Adjusted EBITDA and fiscal 2020 Subscription Sales).  If it was probable that           the 200% targets would be met, the reported value of the aggregate LTIP RSUs reported for each of the NEOs in this column would be as follows: Mr. Whitman, to $2,012,500; Mr. Young, to $612,500; Mr. Covey, to $350,000; Mr. Walker, to $525,000 and           Mr. Miller, to $262,500 (for further information regarding these stock awards and the assumptions made in their valuation, refer to Note 11, Stock-Based                Compensation Plans, to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018).
Non-Equity Incentive             Plan Compensation: The amounts reported in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column for fiscal 2018 represent the amounts paid to each NEO under the STIP for formulaic fiscal 2018 achievement, which is discussed above in the           section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Analysis of Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions and Actions."  Payouts are based on achieving objectives established annually and meeting annual financial targets.  Incentive amounts were           approved by the Compensation Committee and were paid following the conclusion of the fiscal year. All Other Compensation:           The amounts reported for fiscal 2018 in the "All Other Compensation" column are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 All Other Compensation Table" below.

Fiscal 2018 Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
We do not offer any pension plans.  The Company's non-qualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan was frozen to new           contributions as of January 1, 2005.  Effective August 15, 2005, NQDC balances invested in our stock are distributable to participants only in the form of shares of our stock.  None of the NEOs participates in the NQDC plan. Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
Severance Benefits Upon Termination Without Cause
Our NEOs are subject to the same general (non-change-in-control) severance policies as for all Franklin Covey employees.            Under our severance policy, Company employees, including each of the NEOs, who are terminated involuntarily by the Company without cause receive a lump sum payment equal to one week's salary for every $10,000 of their annual total targeted cash           compensation.  Additionally, we pay COBRA medical and dental premiums for the term of the severance period.  As a condition to receipt of severance benefits, the NEO must agree to abide by specific non-compete, non-solicitation and           confidentiality requirements.  The target total severance payment equals the target annual cash compensation plus target COBRA premiums for the severance period.  The COBRA benefits are generally limited to 18 months for all NEOs.  The amounts           below assume that each NEO incurred a qualifying termination of employment on August 31, 2018 (the last business day of fiscal 2018).

Change-in-Control Severance Benefit
The Company has entered into a change-in-control severance agreement with each NEO.

The target total severance payment equals the target annual cash compensation plus target COBRA premiums for the severance period.  There are no excise tax gross-ups provided under the           agreements.  The amounts below assume that each NEO incurred a qualifying termination of employment on August 31, 2018.

 Compensation Committee Report
Our Compensation Committee reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A), as prepared by management of           Franklin Covey, and discussed the CD&A with management of Franklin Covey.  Mercer, outside legal counsel and the Company's CFO and Chief People Officer also reviewed the CD&A.  Based on the Committee's review and discussions, the           Committee recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) requires the Company to disclose                      the ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation (under the Summary Compensation Table definition) to that of the Company's median employee (excluding the CEO) using the same methodology.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Our CEO's compensation for fiscal 2018, as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, is $2,729,608. The                      annual total compensation for our median employee is $89,316.29.  The ratio between the CEO's and median employee's annual total compensation as of August 31, 2018 is approximately 31:1.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· To determine the median employee, we prepared a list of our full employee population as of June 30, 2018. The                      population included all US and Non-US employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We established a consistently applied compensation measure inclusive of total cash paid from July 1, 2017,                      through June 30, 2018. We annualized compensation for employees hired during that time. Non-US compensation was converted to US dollars based on applicable exchange rates as of June 30, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K.                      Given the rule's flexibility, the method the Company used to determine the median employee may be different from its peers, so the ratios may not be comparable.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to our audited financial statements for         the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.  The information contained in this report shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or otherwise considered "filed" with the SEC, and such information shall not be incorporated by reference under the Exchange         Act except to the extent that we specifically incorporate such information by reference in such filing.
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and         integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of the Company.  The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and operates in accordance with a written charter, which was adopted by the Board of Directors.  A         copy of that charter is available on our website at www.franklincovey.com.  Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," as required by the         applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the rules of the SEC.
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors.  The Company's         management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an         integrated audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited         financial statements to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.  This review included a discussion of the quality and the acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and system of internal         controls, including the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.  The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the audited financial statements of the Company for the         fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, their judgments as to the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting, and such other matters as are required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards.
The Audit Committee obtained from the independent registered public accountants a formal written statement describing all         relationships between the auditors and the Company that might bear on the auditors' independence consistent with applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and discussed with the auditors any relationships that may         impact their objectivity and independence, and satisfied itself as to the auditors' independence.  The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the         results of the independent registered public accounting firm's examinations and evaluations of the Company's internal control and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
Based upon the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended that the Company's audited         financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

E. Kay Stepp OVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS
This Proxy Statement includes four proposals requiring shareholder action.  Proposal No. 1 requests the election of eight         directors to the Board of Directors.  Proposal No. 2 requests an advisory vote on executive compensation.  Proposal No. 3 requests the ratification of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.          Proposal No. 4 requests the approval of the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  Each of these proposals is discussed in more detail in the pages that follow.
PROPOSAL NO. 1
Election of Directors
At the Annual Meeting, eight directors are to be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until         their successors shall be duly elected and qualified.  Our director nominees have a great diversity of experiences and bring to our Board a wide variety of skills, qualifications, and viewpoints that strengthen their ability to carry out their         oversight role on behalf of our shareholders.  They have developed their skills and gained experience across a broad range of industries and disciplines in both established and growth markets.  The biographies contained in the section of this Proxy         Statement entitled, "Nominees for Election to the Board of Directors" describe the many areas of individual expertise that each director nominee brings to our board.
Unless the shareholder indicates otherwise, each proxy will be voted in favor of the eight nominees listed below.  Each of         the nominees is currently serving as a Director of the Company.  If any of the nominees should be unavailable to serve, which is not now anticipated, the proxies solicited hereby will be voted for such other persons as shall be designated by the         present Board of Directors.
Vote Required
The eight nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them, up to         the eight directors to be elected by those shares, will be elected as directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect         on the election of directors.
Pursuant to the Company's bylaws, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" or "against"         from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election shall immediately offer to tender his or her resignation following certification of such shareholder vote.  The Nominating Committee shall promptly consider the director's resignation         offer and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the offer.  The Board of Directors shall act on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days following         certification of the shareholder vote.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of Anne H. Chow, Clayton M.         Christensen, Michael Fung, Dennis G. Heiner, Donald J. McNamara, Joel C. Peterson, E. Kay Stepp, and Robert A. Whitman. PROPOSAL NO. 2
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act (which was added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street         Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and the related rules of the SEC, the Company is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation as described below.  We believe that it is appropriate to seek         the views of shareholders on the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation program.
The overall goal of our executive compensation program is to attract, motivate, and retain a talented and creative team of         executives who will provide leadership for our success in dynamic and competitive markets.  The Company seeks to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance and that is aligned with shareholders' long-term interests.  We believe that our         executive compensation program, which utilizes both short-term cash awards and long-term equity awards, satisfies this goal and is strongly aligned with the long-term interest of our shareholders.
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis, as presented within this Proxy Statement, describes the Company's executive         compensation program and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018 in more detail.  We believe that the compensation program for the Named Executive Officers is instrumental in helping the Company achieve financial goals.          Please refer to the information contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as you consider this proposal.
We are asking the shareholders to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders hereby approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in         this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative disclosure.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company.  However, the Compensation Committee, which is         responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for the         Named Executive Officers.  We currently intend to include a shareholder advisory vote on our executive compensation program each year at our annual meeting of shareholders.
Vote Required
Approval of Proposal No. 2 requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes         cast in opposition.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR Proposal No. 2. PROPOSAL NO. 3
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected the independent registered public accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, LLP to audit our         financial statements for fiscal 2019.  Deloitte began serving as our independent registered public accounting firm in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  The Board of Directors anticipates that one or more representatives of Deloitte will be present         at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Principal Accountant Fees
The following table shows the fees accrued or paid to our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal         years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Fiscal 2018       Fiscal 2017    
 Audit Fees(1)     $   708,979       $   716,574    
 Audit-Related Fees(2)       -         -    
 Tax Fees(3)       29,400         34,139    
 All Other Fees       -         -    
     $   738,379       $   750,713    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Audit fees represent fees and expenses for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements and the                      effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and reviews of our financial statements contained in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, procedures related to registration statements,                      accounting consultations on actual transactions, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory filings.  
  (2)  Audit-Related Fees primarily consist of accounting consultation on proposed transactions.  
  (3)  Tax Fees consisted primarily of fees and expenses for services related to tax compliance, tax planning, and tax consulting.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee pre-approves all services to be performed by our independent registered public accountants and         subsequently reviews the actual fees and expenses paid to them.  All of the audit-related and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved         by the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee has determined that the fees paid for non-audit services are compatible with maintaining independence as our independent registered public accountants.
Vote Required
The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accountants         requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.
Board Recommendation
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as the         Company's independent registered public accountants. PROPOSAL NO. 4
Approval and Ratification of the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan
We are seeking shareholder approval to adopt the Franklin Covey Co. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2019 Omnibus Plan).
Background
On December 7, 2018, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the 2019 Omnibus Plan. The purpose of the 2019         Omnibus Plan is to promote our interests and the interests of our shareholders by aiding us in attracting and retaining employees, officers, consultants, advisors, independent contractors, and non‑employee directors capable of assuring our future         success, to offer such persons incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of our business and to compensate such persons through various stock and cash‑based arrangements, and provide them with opportunities for stock ownership in the         Company, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with our shareholders.
The use of equity incentive awards has           historically been a key component of our compensation program. We previously awarded stock-based compensation instruments, including performance awards and restricted stock under the Franklin Covey Co. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the         2015 Omnibus Plan) and we have outstanding stock options that were granted under the Second Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Incentive Plan (the 1992 Plan).  As of November 30, 2018, there were (i) 593,614 shares of performance and restricted stock         awards outstanding from the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and (ii) 568,750 shares subject to outstanding stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $11.67 per share and a weighted average remaining term of 1.7 years under the 1992         Plan.  These numbers include all outstanding full value awards and stock options from both plans.  The number of performance awards outstanding under the 2015 Omnibus Plan reflects the maximum potential (rather than target) shares that may be         earned by participants for the fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 long-term incentive plan grants.  Using the targeted (100 percent of the award) number of shares for the fiscal 2018 and 2019 long-term incentive awards, the number of outstanding awards         against the 2015 Omnibus Plan is reduced to 463,607 shares.  Assuming the maximum shares are earned by participants on outstanding awards, as of November 30, 2018, there were no shares available for future grants under the 2015 Omnibus Plan.  Accordingly, the Board has determined that, in order to ensure that there are shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans to meet our needs for future           grants during the coming years, a new tranche of shareholder-approved shares is necessary to continue granting incentives and reward opportunities to eligible individuals while assisting us in retaining a competitive edge in today's competitive           business environment.  Further details about our awards currently outstanding can be found in the section "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018           found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
We believe approval of the 2019 Omnibus Plan will give us flexibility to continue to make stock-based grants and other         awards permitted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan over the next two to three years in amounts determined appropriate by the Compensation Committee, which will administer the 2019 Omnibus Plan (as discussed more fully below); however, this timeline is         simply an estimate used by us to determine the number of new shares to ask our shareholders to approve and future circumstances may require us to change our expected equity grant practices. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the         future price of our common stock, award levels/amounts provided by our competitors, and hiring activity during the next few years. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that equity incentive grants are vital to our interests and our         shareholders, as they play an important role in our ability to attract and retain key management, align a significant percentage of our executives' compensation to her or his performance, as well as ours, and generate in our executives a strategic         long-term interest in our performance.  As discussed below, the 2019 Omnibus Plan will allow for the continued use of stock-based compensation and cash compensation and will permit us significant flexibility in determining the types and specific         terms of awards made to participants.  This flexibility will allow us to make future awards based on the then-current objectives for aligning compensation with shareholder value.  While we are aware of the potential dilutive effect of compensatory equity awards, we also recognize the significant motivational and performance benefits that may be achieved from making such awards.
If the 2019 Omnibus Plan is approved by our shareholders, no additional awards will be granted under the 2015 Omnibus Plan         or the 1992 Plan (although all outstanding awards previously granted under these stock incentive plans will remain outstanding and subject to the terms of these plans); provided, however, that any shares subject to any outstanding awards under         these prior plans that are not purchased or are forfeited or reacquired by the Company will become available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Some of the key features of the 2019 Omnibus Plan include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limit on Shares Authorized.                               Under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued is 700,000, plus in certain circumstances, shares that are forfeited                      under the Company's prior plans.  No eligible person may receive an award for more than 250,000 shares in any year.   
• Limit on Shares Authorized.                               Under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the aggregate number of shares that may be issued is 700,000, plus in certain circumstances, shares that are forfeited                      under the Company's prior plans.  No eligible person may receive an award for more than 250,000 shares in any year.   
• No Repricing or Discounting of                        Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs):  Stock options and SARs may not generally be repriced or granted at a discount under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.   
• Limited Share                        "Recycling."  The 2019 Omnibus Plan provides that any shares surrendered to pay the exercise price of an option, shares covered by a stock-settled stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with settlement upon                      exercise, or shares withheld by the Company or tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to any award will not be                      added back ("recycled") to the available shares under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  
• No Payment of Dividends or                        Voting Rights on Unvested Awards.  The 2019 Omnibus Plan prohibits the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on awards other than with respect to restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for which the applicable                      restrictions have lapsed.  Unvested awards may not be voted at Annual Meetings or at other shareholder meetings.   
• Awards                        Subject to Clawback Policy.  All awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be subject to forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to any clawback                      policy we may adopt or amend from time to time, as determined by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards Are                        Typically Not Transferable.  Awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan are typically not transferable, except pursuant to limited exceptions.  If a transfer is permitted, the transfer shall be for no value.  
• Minimum Vesting Period.                         Stock-based compensation awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant (or, in the case of performance-based objectives, one year from the commencement of the period                        over which performance is evaluated), except for five percent of the shares approved, which may be granted with fully vested terms, and subject to the acceleration of vesting as described in the 2019 Omnibus Plan.   
• Minimum Vesting Period.                         Stock-based compensation awards granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will have a minimum vesting period of one year from the date of grant (or, in the case of performance-based objectives, one year from the commencement of the period                        over which performance is evaluated), except for five percent of the shares approved, which may be granted with fully vested terms, and subject to the acceleration of vesting as described in the 2019 Omnibus Plan.   
[END TABLE]
 Request for Additional Shares and Dilution
We manage our long-term shareholder dilution, in part, by controlling the number of equity incentive awards granted         annually.  The Compensation Committee carefully monitors our annual net burn rate, total dilution, and equity expense in order to maximize shareholder value by granting what it believes are an appropriate number of equity incentive awards to         attract, reward, and retain employees.  Burn rate is a measure of the speed at which companies use shares available for grant under their equity compensation plans and is an important factor for investors concerned about shareholder dilution.  The         burn rate is defined as, in a given fiscal year, the number of equity shares granted subject to time-based awards plus performance-based equity awards that were earned and vested, divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.  In         recommending to our shareholders the number of shares to be authorized under the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee considered our burn rate for the past three fiscal years as shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Fiscal 2018       Fiscal 2017       Fiscal 2016    
 Time-based equity awards granted       66,221   (1)        29,834         25,032    
 Performance-based awards earned and vested(2)       247,619         144,548         7,350    
 Weighted average common shares outstanding       13,849,000         13,819,000         14,944,000

 Performance-based awards granted       128,650   (3)        183,381         231,276    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   Amount consists of our annual unvested stock award to non-employee members of the Board plus the time-based                    component of the fiscal 2018 long-term incentive plan award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (2)   Amount excludes shares purchased by and issued to participants in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (3)   The fiscal 2018 long-term incentive award allows a range of shares to be vested based upon the achievement of                    performance objectives.  Participants may earn a range of shares from 50 percent of the target award to 200 percent of the target award.  The number of shares shown in the table reflects the target number of shares granted to                    participants.  The maximum number of shares that may vest to participants under the 2018 long-term incentive plan is 257,300 shares.  If minimum specified targets are not achieved, no shares will be earned by participants.  For further                    information on our stock-based compensation plans, refer to Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 as filed on Form 10-K with the SEC on November 14, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
A copy of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement.  The following summary of the material         terms of the 2019 Omnibus Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Administration
The Compensation Committee administers the 2019 Omnibus Plan and has full power and authority to determine when and to         whom awards will be granted, and the type, amount and other terms and conditions of each award, consistent with the provisions of the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  Subject to the provisions of the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the Compensation Committee may amend the         terms of, or accelerate the exercisability of, an outstanding award.  The Compensation Committee has authority to interpret the 2019 Omnibus Plan and establish, amend, suspend, or waive rules and regulations for the administration of the 2019         Omnibus Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate its powers under the 2019 Omnibus Plan to one or more officers or directors to the         extent permitted by applicable exchange rules or applicable corporate law, except that such delegated officers or directors will not be permitted to grant awards (i) to officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (ii) in such a         manner as would cause the 2019 Omnibus Plan to not comply with applicable exchange rules or applicable corporate law.
Under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the         Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan.
Shares Available for Awards
The aggregate number of shares that may be issued under all stock-based awards made under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be         equal to (i) 700,000 shares, plus (ii) any shares subject to any outstanding award under the 2015 Omnibus Plan or the 1992 Plan that, after November 30, 2018 are not purchased or are forfeited or reacquired by the Company, or otherwise not         delivered to the participant due to the termination or cancellation of such award, less (iii) any shares subject to any award issued under the 2015 Omnibus Plan or the 1992 Plan after November 30, 2018.  If awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan expire         or otherwise terminate without being exercised, the shares of common stock not acquired pursuant to such awards again become available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  However, under the following circumstances, shares will not again be         available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan: (i) shares unissued due to a "net exercise" of a stock option or exercise of a SAR, (ii) any shares withheld or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations, (iii) shares covered by a         stock-settled SAR issued under the 2019 Omnibus Plan that are not issued in connection with settlement in shares upon exercise, and (iv) shares repurchased using stock option exercise proceeds.  In addition, awards that do not entitle the recipient         to receive or purchase shares shall not be counted against the number of shares available for issuance under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Certain awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan are subject to limitations.  Under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, no person may be         granted options and SARs for more than 250,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate in any fiscal year, and no person may be granted performance awards denominated in shares for more than 250,000 shares of our common stock in the aggregate         in any fiscal year.  Non-employee directors may not be granted awards in any calendar year that exceed in the aggregate $125,000.
In the event that any dividend (other than a regular cash dividend) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash,         shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split‑up, spin‑off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares or other securities of the Company, issuance         of warrants or other rights to purchase shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the shares such that an adjustment is necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or         potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, then the Compensation Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of shares (or other securities or other         property) available under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, (ii) the number and type of shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding awards, (iii) the purchase price or exercise price with respect to any award, and (iv) the share         limitations described above. Eligibility
Any employee, officer, non-employee director, consultant, independent contractor or advisor providing services to Franklin         Covey Co. or an affiliate, or any person to whom an offer of employment has been made, and who is selected by the Compensation Committee to participate, is eligible to receive an award under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  As of November 30, 2018,         approximately 85 persons were eligible as a class to be selected by the Compensation Committee to receive awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Dilution Discussion
In setting the number of shares authorized under the 2019 Omnibus Plan for which shareholder approval is being sought, the         Compensation Committee and the Board considered, among other factors, the historical amounts of equity awards granted by the Company, and the potential future grants over the next several years.  The Committee and the Board also considered         recommendations by the CEO for the other named executive officers.  Neither the Committee nor the Board has authorized specific grants of awards to be made under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, subject to shareholder approval.  However, the Compensation         Committee and the Board believe that the shares being requested should be sufficient for awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan for approximately the next two to three years.
To reduce the dilutive impact of our equity award grants on our shareholders' interests, we actively administer our equity         grant program to make use of our resources as effectively as possible. Equity awards are generally limited to (i) those positions deemed critical to our future success, (ii) individuals whose personal performance makes them highly valuable to us,         and (iii) essential new hires.
Types of Awards and Terms and Conditions
The 2019 Omnibus Plan provides that the Compensation Committee may grant awards to eligible participants in any of the         following forms, subject to such terms, conditions, and provisions as the Compensation Committee may determine to be necessary or desirable:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock options, including both incentive stock options (ISOs) and non-qualified stock options (together with ISOs, options);   
• stock appreciation rights;   
• restricted stock;   
• restricted stock units; and   
• other stock-based awards   
[END TABLE]
Options and SARs
The holder of an option is entitled to purchase a number of shares of our common stock at a specified exercise price         during a specified time period, all as determined by the Compensation Committee. The holder of a SAR is entitled to receive the excess of the fair market value (calculated as of the exercise date) of a specified number of shares of our common stock         over the grant price of the SAR.
Exercise Price.         The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the exercise price and other terms of options and SARs, except that the exercise price will in no event be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of our common stock underlying         the award on the date of grant, unless such option or SAR is granted in substitution for an option or SAR previously granted by a merged or acquired entity. Without the approval of shareholders, we will not amend, replace, or cash out previously         granted options or SARs in a transaction that constitutes a "re-pricing" as discussed in the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Vesting. The         Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine when and under what circumstances an option or SAR will vest.
Exercise. The         Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the time or times, and method or methods by which an option or SAR may be exercised, provided that a participant may elect to exercise using a net exercise.  The Compensation Committee and the         Board are not authorized under the 2019 Omnibus Plan to accept a promissory note as consideration. Expiration. Options              and SARs will expire at such time as the Compensation Committee determines; provided, however, that no option or SAR may be exercised more than ten years from the date of grant, except that, in the case of an ISO held by a 10% shareholder, the         option may not be exercised more than five years from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may provide in the terms of an option (either at grant or by subsequent modification) that, to the extent consistent         with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option, (other than an ISO) (i) the exercise of the Option is prohibited by applicable law or (ii) shares may not be purchased or sold by         certain employees or directors of the Company due to the "black-out period" of a Company policy or a "lock-up" agreement undertaken in connection with an issuance of securities by the Company, the term of the Option shall be extended for a period         of not more than thirty (30) days following the end of the legal prohibition, black-out period, or lock-up agreement.
Special Limitations on           ISOs. The aggregate number of shares that may be issued under all ISOs under the Plan shall be 700,000 shares. In the case of a grant of an option intended to qualify as an ISO, no such option may be granted to a participant who owns, at         the time of the grant, stock representing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock or our subsidiaries unless the exercise price per share of our common stock subject to such ISO is at least 110% of the fair         market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant, and such ISO award is not exercisable more than five years after its date of grant. In addition, options designated as ISOs shall not be eligible for treatment under the Internal         Revenue Code as ISOs to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of shares of common stock (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such ISOs are exercisable for the first time by the participant during any calendar year         exceeds $100,000.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock             Units
The holder of restricted stock will own shares of our common stock subject to restrictions imposed by the Compensation         Committee for a specified time period determined by the Compensation Committee.  The holder of restricted stock units will have the right, subject to restrictions imposed by the Compensation Committee, to receive shares of our common stock at some         future date determined by the Compensation Committee.  The grant, issuance, retention, vesting and/or settlement of restricted stock and restricted stock units will occur at such times and in such installments as determined by the Compensation         Committee.  The Compensation Committee will have the right to make the timing of the grant and/or the issuance, ability to retain, vesting and/or settlement of restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to continued employment, passage of         time and/or such performance conditions as are deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee has the authority to issue restricted stock units that may be settled in stock, cash, or both.  The holders of restricted         stock units shall have no voting rights and shall have no dividend rights.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The Compensation Committee is authorized to grant to any employee, officer, non-employee director, consultant, independent         contractor or advisor providing services to the Company or any affiliate other awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares (including, without limitation,         securities convertible into shares), as are deemed by the Compensation Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of such awards, subject to the terms of the         2019 Omnibus Plan and any applicable award agreement.  Awards granted under this category may not contain a purchase right or an option-like exercise feature. Duration, Termination, and Amendment
The 2019 Omnibus Plan has a term of ten years expiring on December 7, 2028, unless terminated earlier by the Board.  The         Board may at any time and from time to time and in any respect amend, suspend, or terminate the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  The Board shall require the approval of any amendment of the 2019 Omnibus Plan that would: (i) be required under the listing         requirements of the SEC, the NYSE or another exchange or securities market on which our shares are then listed for trading, (ii) increase the number of shares authorized under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, (iii) increase the annual participant share         limits or annual cash award limits, (iv) permit a repricing of options or SARs, (v) permit the award of options or SARs with an exercise price less than 100% of the fair market value of a share on the date of grant, or (vi) increase the maximum         term of options or SARs.  No amendment of the 2019 Omnibus Plan may be made that would adversely affect any outstanding award without the consent of the participant or the current holder of the award.
Effect of Corporate Transaction
Awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan are generally subject to special provisions upon the occurrence of any reorganization,         merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, plan of arrangement, take-over bid or tender offer, Change in Control (as defined in the 2019 Omnibus Plan), repurchase or exchange of shares, or any other similar corporate transaction with         respect to us.  In the event of such a corporate transaction, the Compensation Committee or the Board may provide for one or more of the following to occur upon the occurrence of the event (or immediately prior to such event, provided the event is         consummated):
[BEGIN TABLE]
• termination of any award, whether or not vested, in exchange for an amount of cash and/or other property, if any, equal to the                    amount that would have been attained upon exercise of the award or the realization of the participant's rights under the award. Awards may be terminated without payment if the Compensation Committee or the Board determines that no amount                    is realizable under the award as of the time of the transaction;   
• replacement of any award with other rights or property selected by the Compensation Committee or the Board;   
• the assumption of any award by the successor entity (or its parent or subsidiary) or the arrangement for the substitution for                    similar awards covering the stock of such successor entity, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; or   
• require that the award cannot vest, be exercised or become payable until after a future date, which may be the effective date of                    the corporate transaction.   
[END TABLE]
Time-based awards may only be accelerated for events occurring in connection with a corporate transaction that are         materially adverse to the participant, subject to the exceptions described in the 2019 Omnibus Plan.
Clawback or Recoupment
All awards under the 2019 Omnibus Plan will be subject to forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to any clawback policy we         may adopt or amend from time to time, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Income Tax Withholding
In order to comply with all applicable income tax laws and regulations, we may take appropriate action to ensure that all         applicable taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of the participant, are withheld or collected from the participant.  A participant may satisfy any tax obligation by (a) electing to have a portion of the shares withheld that         otherwise would be delivered upon exercise, receipt or the lapse of restrictions with respect to the award (but only to the extent necessary to satisfy withholding requirements as required by ASC Topic 718 to avoid adverse accounting treatment), or         (b) electing to deliver to us shares of Franklin Covey Co. other than shares received pursuant to the award with a fair market value equal to the amount of the tax obligation.  Any election, if allowed, must be made on or before the date that the         amount of tax to be withheld is determined.  We may not withhold shares for income taxes in such a manner as would result in adverse accounting treatment under FASC Topic 718 regarding the accounting treatment of shares withheld for income taxes.
Limited Transferability of Awards
Except as provided below, no award (other than fully vested and unrestricted shares issued pursuant to any award) and no         right under any such award shall be transferable by a participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and no award (other than fully vested and unrestricted shares issued pursuant to any award) or right under any such         award may be pledged, alienated, attached, or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any affiliate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the         Compensation Committee may permit the transfer of an award other than a fully vested and unrestricted share to family members, provided such permitted transfer shall be for no value and in accordance with the rules of Form S-8.  The Compensation         Committee may also establish procedures as it deems appropriate for a participant to designate a person or persons, as beneficiary or beneficiaries, to exercise the rights of the participant and receive any property distributable with respect to         any award in the event of the participant's death.
Federal Income Tax Consequences
Grant of Options and SARs
The grant of a stock option or SAR is not expected to result in any taxable income to the recipient.
Exercise of Options and SARs
Upon exercising a non-qualified stock option, the optionee must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair         market value of the shares of our common stock acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price, and we generally will be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the same amount.  The holder of an ISO generally will have no         taxable income upon exercising the option (except that an alternative minimum tax liability may arise), and we will not be entitled to an income tax deduction. Upon exercising a SAR, the amount of any cash received and the fair market value on the         exercise date of any shares of our common stock received are taxable to the recipient as ordinary income and generally are deductible by us.
Disposition of Shares Acquired Upon             Exercise of Options and SARs
The tax consequence upon a disposition of shares acquired through the exercise of an option or SAR will depend on how long         the shares have been held and whether the shares were acquired by exercising an ISO or by exercising a non-qualified stock option or SAR. Following exercise of a non-qualified stock option or SAR, any additional gain or loss recognized upon any         later disposition of the shares will be capital gain or loss. If an optionee exercises an ISO and later sells or otherwise disposes of the shares both (i) more than two years after the grant date and (ii) more than one year after the exercise date,         the difference between the sale price and the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain or loss. If an optionee exercise an ISO, but later sells or disposes the shares before the end of the applicable ISO holding periods described above, the         optionee will have ordinary income at the time of the sale equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or the sale price, if less) minus the exercise price of the option. Generally, there will be no tax consequence to us in         connection with the disposition of shares acquired under an option or SAR, except that we may be entitled to an income tax deduction in the case of the disposition of shares acquired under an ISO before the end of the applicable ISO holding periods         described above. Awards Other than Options and SARs
If an award is payable in shares of our common stock that are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, unless a special         election is made by the holder of the award under the Internal Revenue Code, the holder must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of: (i) the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the first time the shares become         transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier) over (ii) the amount (if any) paid for the shares by the holder of the award. We will generally be entitled at that time to an income tax deduction for the         same amount. As to awards other than options and SARs granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan that are payable either in cash or shares of our common stock not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, the holder of the award must recognize ordinary         income equal to: (a) the amount of cash received or, as applicable, (b) the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the date such shares are received) over (ii) the amount (if any) paid for the shares by the         holder of the award.
Income Tax Deduction
Subject to the tax rules requiring that compensation be reasonable in order to be deductible, our obligation to withhold         or otherwise collect certain income and payroll taxes, we generally will be entitled to a corresponding income tax deduction at the time a participant recognizes ordinary income from awards made under the 2019 Omnibus Plan.  However, Section 162(m)         of the Code prohibits publicly held corporations from deducting more than $1 million per year in compensation paid to certain named executive officers.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act), which was signed into law at the end of 2017, makes         significant changes to the deduction limit under Section 162(m), which will be effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018.  The Act eliminated the exception to the deduction limit for qualified performance-based compensation         and broadens the application of the deduction limit to certain current and former executive officers who previously were exempt from such limit.  However, the Act also includes a transition provision, which exempts from the above changes         compensation under a written binding agreement that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and was not subsequently materially amended.  Therefore, compensation paid to a covered executive in excess of $1 million will not be deductible for taxable years         beginning on and after January 1, 2018 unless it qualifies for transition or other regulatory relief.
Special Rules for Executive Officers             Subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
Special rules may apply to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  In particular, unless a special         election is made pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, shares received through the exercise or settlement of an award may be treated as restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a period of up to six         months after the date of exercise.  Accordingly, the amount of any ordinary income recognized and the amount of our income tax deduction will be determined as of the end of that period. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
The Compensation Committee and the Board intend to administer and interpret the 2019 Omnibus Plan and all award agreements         in a manner consistent to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code to avoid any adverse tax results thereunder to a holder of an award.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table gives information, as of August 31, 2018, about shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the         exercise of options and other equity awards under all compensation plans for which equity securities are reserved for issuance.

(2)  Amount includes 790,143 performance share awards that may be awarded under the terms of various long-term incentive plans.  The number of shares eventually                      awarded to participants through our long-term incentive plans is variable and based upon the achievement of specified financial goals.  For performance-based compensation awards where the number of shares may fluctuate within a range                      based on the achievement of the specified goal, this amount includes the maximum number of shares that may be awarded to participants.  The actual number of shares issued to participants therefore, may be less than the amount                      disclosed.  The weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights does not include the impact of performance awards.  For further information on our stock-based compensation plans, refer to the notes to our                      financial statements as presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.

 New Plan Benefits
No awards have yet been granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan, as it will only take effect upon shareholder approval at the         2019 Annual Meeting.  The number and types of awards that will be granted under the 2019 Omnibus Plan in the future are not determinable, as the Compensation Committee will make these determinations in their sole discretion.
Market Value
The closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 2018 was $23.69 per share.
Vote Required
The proposal to approve the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan will be approved if the number of votes cast in favor of the         proposal exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition of the proposal.  Abstentions with respect to this proposal will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.  Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal.
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the approval of the 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors knows of no other matters to be presented for action at the         meeting.  However, if any further business should properly come before the meeting, the persons named as proxies in the accompanying form of proxy will vote on such business in accordance with their best judgment.
PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in Our Proxy Materials
Shareholders may present proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for the annual meeting of         shareholders to be held in calendar year 2020, provided that such proposals must be received by us, at our executive offices (2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331) no later than August 23, 2019, provided that this date may         be changed in the event that the date of the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in calendar year 2020 is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in calendar year 2019.  Such proposals must         also comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC if such proposals are to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy.
Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Brought Before the Annual Meeting
Our bylaws provide that, except in the case of proposals made in accordance with Rule 14a-8, for shareholder nominations         to the Board of Directors or other proposals to be considered at an annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of Franklin Covey not less than 60 nor more than 90 calendar days         prior to the anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting.  To be timely for the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in calendar year 2019, a shareholder's notice must be delivered or mailed to, and received by, our         Secretary at our executive offices (2200 West Parkway Boulevard, Salt Lake City, Utah 84119-2331) between October 28, 2018 and November 27, 2018.  However, in the event that the annual         meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 calendar days of the anniversary of the date on which the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders was called, to be timely, notice by the shareholder must be so received not earlier         than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of either (i) the 60th day prior to such annual meeting, or (ii) the close of business on the tenth         day following the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made by the Company, whichever occurs first.  In no event will the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual         meeting of shareholders commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as provided above.  A shareholder's notice to our Secretary must set forth the information required by our bylaws with respect to each matter the         shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting.
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, if a shareholder intends to propose any matter for a vote at our annual meeting to         be held in calendar year 2019 but fails to notify us of that intention prior to November 7, 2018, then a proxy solicited by the Board of Directors may be voted on that matter in the discretion of the proxy holder, provided that this date may be         changed in the event that the date of the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in calendar year 2019 is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the annual meeting of shareholders held in calendar year 2018.

(b)            Delegation.  The Committee may delegate to one or more officers or           Directors of the Company, subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may establish in its sole discretion, the authority to grant Awards; provided, however, that the Committee shall not delegate such authority (i) with regard to grants of           Awards to be made to officers of the Company or any Affiliate who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (ii) in such a manner as would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of applicable exchange rules or applicable           corporate law. (c)            Power and Authority of the Board.  Notwithstanding anything to the           contrary contained herein, (i) the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan, unless the exercise of such powers and duties by the           Board would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of Rule 16b‑3; and (ii) only the Committee (or another committee of the Board comprised of directors who qualify as independent directors within the meaning of the independence rules           of any applicable securities exchange where the Shares are then listed) may grant Awards to Directors who are not also employees of the Company or an Affiliate.
(d)            Indemnification.  To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no member           of the Board, the Committee or any person to whom the Committee delegates authority under the Plan shall be liable for any action or determination taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award made under the Plan, and (ii) the           members of the Board, the Committee and each person to whom the Committee delegates authority under the Plan shall be entitled to indemnification by the Company with regard to such actions and determinations.  The provisions of this paragraph           shall be in addition to such other rights of indemnification as a member of the Board, the Committee or any other person may have by virtue of such person's position with the Company.

On and after shareholder approval of                      this Plan, no awards shall be granted under the Prior Stock Plans, but all outstanding awards previously granted under the Prior Stock Plans shall remain outstanding and subject to the terms of the Prior Stock Plans.   
(iii)   any Shares subject to any award issued under the Prior Stock Plans after November 30, 2018.  On and after shareholder approval of                      this Plan, no awards shall be granted under the Prior Stock Plans, but all outstanding awards previously granted under the Prior Stock Plans shall remain outstanding and subject to the terms of the Prior Stock Plans.   
[END TABLE]
 (b)            Counting Shares.  For purposes of this Section 4, except as set forth in this Section 4(b) below, if an           Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for           granting Awards under the Plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
            (i)                   Shares Added Back to Reserve.                             Subject to the limitations in (ii) below, if any Shares covered by an Award or to which an Award relates are not purchased or are forfeited or are reacquired by the Company, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number                      of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture, reacquisition by the Company, termination or cancellation, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan.   
           (ii)                       Shares Not Added Back to Reserve.                       Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in (i) above, the following Shares will not again become available for issuance under the Plan:  (A) any Shares which would have been issued upon any exercise of an Option but for the fact that                      the exercise price was paid by a "net exercise" pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii)(B) or any Shares tendered in payment of the exercise price of an                      Option; (B) any Shares withheld by the Company or Shares tendered to satisfy any tax withholding obligation; (C) Shares covered by a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right issued under the Plan that are not issued in connection with                      settlement in Shares upon exercise; or (D) Shares that are repurchased by the Company using Option exercise proceeds.   
          (iii)                   Cash-Only Awards.  Awards that do not                      entitle the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.   
           (iv)                       Substitute Awards Relating to Acquired Entities.                             Shares issued under Awards granted in substitution for awards previously granted by an entity that is acquired by or merged with the Company or an Affiliate shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for                      Awards under the Plan.   
[END TABLE]
(c)            Adjustments.  In the event that any dividend (other than a regular           cash dividend) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split‑up, spin‑off, combination, repurchase           or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is           necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and           type of Shares (or other securities or other property) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the purchase price or           exercise price with respect to any Award and (iv) the limitations contained in Sections 4(d)(i) and (ii) below; provided, however, that the number of Shares           covered by any Award or to which such Award relates shall always be a whole number.  Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee or the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. (d)            Award Limitations Under the Plan.  The limitation contained in this           Section 4(d) shall apply only with respect to any Award or Awards granted under this Plan, and limitations on awards granted under any other           shareholder‑approved incentive plan maintained by the Company will be governed solely by the terms of such other plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
            (i)                      Limitation for Employees and Officers.

            (iii)   Limitation of Awards Granted to Non-Employee                          Directors.

The foregoing limit shall not apply to any Award made pursuant to any election by the Director to receive an Award in lieu of all or a portion of                      annual and committee retainers and annual meeting fees.

Section 5.                          Eligibility
Any Eligible Person shall be eligible to be designated as a Participant.  In determining which           Eligible Persons shall receive an Award and the terms of any Award, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective Eligible Persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the           Company or such other factors as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to employees (which term as used herein includes, without limitation, officers           and Directors who are also employees), and an Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to an employee of an Affiliate unless such Affiliate is also a "subsidiary corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code or           any successor provision.

 (ii)                            Option Term.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may provide in the terms of an Option (either at grant or by subsequent                        modification) that, to the extent consistent with Section 409A, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option (other than an Incentive Stock Option) (i) the exercise of the Option is prohibited by applicable law                        or (ii) Shares may not be purchased or sold by certain employees or directors of the Company due to the "black-out period" of a Company policy or a "lock-up" agreement undertaken in connection with an issuance of securities by the                        Company, the term of the Option shall be extended for a period of not more than thirty (30) days following the end of the legal prohibition, black-out period or lock-up agreement.   
(iii)   Time and Method of Exercise.                         Subject to Section 6(a)(iii)(B), the Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part and                        the method or methods by which, and the form or forms, including, but not limited to, cash, Shares (actually or by attestation), other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value                        on the exercise date equal to the applicable exercise price, in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.

 (A)                            Promissory Notes.  Notwithstanding                        the foregoing, the Committee may not accept a promissory note as consideration.   
(B)   
                        Net Exercises.  Notwithstanding                        anything to the contrary herein, the Participant may, in his or her discretion, exercise an Option by requesting that the Company deliver to the Participant a number of Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of                        the date of exercise) equal to the excess, if positive, of the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Option being exercised on the date of exercise, over the exercise price of the Option for such Shares.   
(B)   
                        Net Exercises.  Notwithstanding                        anything to the contrary herein, the Participant may, in his or her discretion, exercise an Option by requesting that the Company deliver to the Participant a number of Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of                        the date of exercise) equal to the excess, if positive, of the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the Option being exercised on the date of exercise, over the exercise price of the Option for such Shares.

 (b)            Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee is hereby authorized to           grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Persons subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement.

For purposes of clarity and without limiting the Committee's general authority under Section 3(a), vesting of such Awards may, at the Committee's discretion, be conditioned upon the Participant's completion of a minimum period of service with the                      Company or an Affiliate, or upon the achievement of one or more performance goals established by the Committee, or upon any combination of service-based and performance-based conditions.  As provided in Section 6(e)(ix) below, the holders of Restricted Stock will not have any voting, dividend, or other rights until the Restricted Stock restrictions lapse or are waived.  The                      holders of Restricted Stock Units shall have no voting rights and shall have no dividend rights until the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived.   
(i)

For purposes of clarity and without limiting the Committee's general authority under Section 3(a), vesting of such Awards may, at the Committee's discretion, be conditioned upon the Participant's completion of a minimum period of service with the                      Company or an Affiliate, or upon the achievement of one or more performance goals established by the Committee, or upon any combination of service-based and performance-based conditions.  As provided in Section 6(e)(ix) below, the holders of Restricted Stock will not have any voting, dividend, or other rights until the Restricted Stock restrictions lapse or are waived.  The                      holders of Restricted Stock Units shall have no voting rights and shall have no dividend rights until the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived.

                      Acceleration of Vesting or Exercisability.                             No Award Agreement shall accelerate time-based vesting of any Award solely in connection with any corporate transaction as described in Section 7(b);                      provided, that an Award Agreement may accelerate time-based vesting for events occurring in connection with a corporate transaction                      that are materially adverse to the Participant (e.g., termination without cause, resignation for good reason, death or disability,                      as such terms are determined by the Committee).  The Committee may, pursuant to its general authority under Section 3(a), waive the foregoing                      limitation and accelerate time-based vesting under an Award, but only upon the consummation of (or effective immediately prior to the consummation of, provided that the consummation subsequently occurs) a corporate transaction that                      qualifies as a Change in Control where the definitive agreement among the parties to the Change in Control contemplates that the Award will be cancelled in exchange for an immediate right to cash in accordance with Section 7(b)(i).  The foregoing limitation shall not be construed to limit the Committee's ability to modify performance vesting conditions (as                      opposed to time-based vesting provisions) in connection with a corporate transaction.

Except as provided                      in Section 4(c)(with respect to equitable adjustments), the holders of Awards shall have no voting rights and shall have no dividend or                      equivalent rights (including no right to accrue dividends or dividend equivalent amounts that become payable upon vesting, lapse of restrictions, or settlement of an Award).  In the event of any non-regular dividend or similar equitable                      adjustment to an Award under Section 4(c), such dividend or other adjustment amount shall be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions                      as apply to the underlying Award Shares.  The foregoing limitations shall not apply to fully vested, unrestricted Shares issued under any Award.   
(ix)

Except as provided                      in Section 4(c)(with respect to equitable adjustments), the holders of Awards shall have no voting rights and shall have no dividend or                      equivalent rights (including no right to accrue dividends or dividend equivalent amounts that become payable upon vesting, lapse of restrictions, or settlement of an Award).  In the event of any non-regular dividend or similar equitable                      adjustment to an Award under Section 4(c), such dividend or other adjustment amount shall be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions                      as apply to the underlying Award Shares.  The foregoing limitations shall not apply to fully vested, unrestricted Shares issued under any Award.

[END TABLE]
(c)            Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies.  The Committee           may, without prior approval of the shareholders of the Company, correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to           implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan.
Section 8.                          Income Tax Withholding
In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or           regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant, are           withheld or collected from such Participant.  In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, a           Participant may, in his or her discretion, satisfy such tax obligation by (a) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such           Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes (consistent with the guidance provided by ASC Topic 718 to avoid adverse accounting treatment) or (b) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or           receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes.  The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined. Section 9.                          General Provisions
(a)            No Rights to Awards.  No Eligible Person, Participant or other           Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan.  The terms and conditions of Awards           need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
(b)            Award Agreements.  No Participant shall have rights under an Award           granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been signed by the Participant (if requested by the Company), or until such Award Agreement is delivered and accepted through an electronic medium in accordance with           procedures established by the Company.  An Award Agreement need not be signed by a representative of the Company unless required by the Committee.  Each Award Agreement shall be subject to the applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and any           other terms and conditions (not inconsistent with the Plan) determined by the Committee.
(c)            Plan Provisions Control.  In the event that any provision of an           Award Agreement conflicts with or is inconsistent in any respect with the terms of the Plan as set forth herein or subsequently amended, the terms of the Plan shall control.
(d)            No Rights of Shareholders.  Except with respect to Shares issued           under Awards (and subject to such conditions as the Committee may impose on such Awards pursuant to Section 6(c)(i)), neither a Participant nor           the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until such           Shares have been issued.
(e)            No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in           the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation plans or arrangements, and such plans or arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific           cases.
(f)            No Right to Employment.  The grant of an Award shall not be           construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, with or without           cause, in accordance with applicable law.  In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the           Plan or in any Award Agreement.  Nothing in this Plan shall confer on any person any legal or equitable right against the Company or any Affiliate, directly or indirectly, or give rise to any cause of action at law or in equity against the           Company or an Affiliate.  Under no circumstances shall any person ceasing to be an employee of the Company or any Affiliate be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit under the Plan which such employee might otherwise           have enjoyed but for termination of employment, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful or unfair dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise.  By participating in the Plan, each Participant shall be deemed to have           accepted all the conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee and shall be fully bound thereby. (g)            Governing Law.  The internal law, and not the law of conflicts, of           the State of Utah shall govern all questions concerning the validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award.
(h)            Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or           becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to           applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or           Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
(i)            No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall           create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person.  To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from           the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
(j)            Other Benefits.  No compensation or benefit awarded to or realized           by any Participant under the Plan shall be included for the purpose of computing such Participant's compensation or benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, disability, severance, termination pay, welfare           or other benefit plan of the Company, unless required by law or otherwise provided by such other plan.
(k)            No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or           delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Share or whether such fractional Share or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise           eliminated.
(l)            Headings.  Headings are given to the sections and subsections of the           Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Section 10.                          Clawback or Recoupment
All Awards under this Plan shall be subject to forfeiture or other penalties pursuant to (i) any           Company clawback policy, as may be adopted or amended from time to time, (ii) any applicable law, rule or regulation or applicable stock exchange rule, including, without limitation, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Section 954 of           the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and any applicable stock exchange listing rule adopted pursuant thereto, and (iii) such forfeiture and/or penalty conditions or           provisions as determined by the Committee.  By accepting an Award hereunder, the Participant agrees to such recovery or other penalties. Section 11.                          Effective Date of the Plan
The Plan was adopted by the Board on December 7, 2018.  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the           shareholders of the Company at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company to be held on January 25, 2019, and the Plan shall be effective as of the date of such shareholder approval.  On and after shareholder approval of the Plan, no           awards shall be granted under the Prior Stock Plan, but all outstanding awards previously granted under the Prior Stock Plan shall remain outstanding and subject to the terms of the Prior Stock Plan.
Section 12.                          Term of the Plan
No Award shall be granted under the Plan, and the Plan shall terminate, on December 7, 2028 or any           earlier date of discontinuation or termination established pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Plan.  Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an           applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such dates, and the authority of the Committee provided for hereunder with respect to the Plan and any Awards, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall           extend beyond the termination of the Plan. APPENDIX  B
ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION TO NET INCOME (LOSS)
For fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018, Adjusted EBITDA means net income or loss from operations excluding the impact of interest         expense, income tax expense, amortization, depreciation, share-based compensation expense and non-recurring items.  The Company references this non-GAAP financial measure in its disclosure and decision making because it provides supplemental         information that facilitates consistent internal comparisons to the historical operating performance of prior periods and the Company believes it provides investors with greater transparency to evaluate operational activities and financial results.
