Letter from the Independent Directors of the Board 
Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
We are writing to you as the independent members of the Huron board of directors. As fellow shareholders, we are committed to working to ensure that Huron's management compensation programs align with the long-term interests of the Company and our shareholders. At last year's annual meeting, you made your feelings known to us through the Say on Pay approval vote and we want you to know we heard your feedback and have taken action. Last year's Say on Pay vote received 40% support, after an average of 98.5% support since 2011. In response, last fall our chairs of the board and of the Compensation Committee, along with Huron's CFO, solicited feedback from holders of over 70% of the Company's outstanding shares and met in person or on the telephone with holders of 41% of the Company's shares. This shareholder engagement took place after the annual meeting and the primary focus areas were the NEO compensation program and corporate governance. We sincerely thank those of you who provided your feedback. 
As added context, in response to the significant changes in the demand for our services discussed below, the board and executives reviewed the Company strategy in 2017 and took a number of actions to improve our long-term revenue growth and EBITDA margins, while at the same time retaining and attracting the best talent. In 2018, we implemented a new multi-year strategy and have begun to see important business performance improvements. Additionally in 2018, we carefully considered the feedback we received from our shareholders and made certain modifications to compensation programs to more clearly align long-term compensation for NEOs with our strategic plan and the interests of our shareholders. Given the transformational strategy currently underway, we believe that our revised compensation plan will be an effective way to reward management for creating long-term shareholder value. 
Outlined below is what we heard from you and how we addressed it. 
Long-Term Incentive 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◆ You objected to the increase in our CEOs long-term  incentive target from 225% of base salary to 300% of base salary for 2017.◆ In lieu of any base salary increases over  the past four years, the Compensation Committee elected to place emphasis on long-term performance. In light of feedback, while still not increasing base salary for a fifth year, and maintaining the emphasis on long-term performance, aligned with  the strategic actions described above, we have reduced the CEO LTI target back to 225% of salary for 2019. 
◆ You did not support a portion of the long-term incentive plan being tied to one-year measurements.◆ Beginning in 2018, the long-term incentive plan contains only aggregate  three-year measurements. We kept this change in place for 2019.   
◆ You did not support a portion of the long-term incentive plan being tied to one-year measurements.◆ Beginning in 2018, the long-term incentive plan contains only aggregate  three-year measurements. We kept this change in place for 2019.   
[END TABLE]
Annual Incentive 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◆ `     You wanted to see less emphasis on subjective strategic measures and to better understand how  the performance on the strategic measures was assessed.◆ For 2018, 30% of our NEOs target annual incentive opportunity was tied  to strategic measures. The strategic measures contain 60% quantitative elements, resulting in only 12% of the annual incentive plan being determined by subjective measures. We have been more explicit in the CD&A section of this proxy about how  we assessed performance in 2018 against the strategic measures.

We have been more explicit in the CD&A section of this proxy about how  we assessed performance in 2018 against the strategic measures.   
◆ You wanted to see more emphasis on organic revenue  growth.◆ Beginning in 2018, we replaced the revenue  measure with organic revenue growth to appropriately emphasize our organic growth imperatives. 
◆ Some of you wanted TSR to have an influence on  payout.◆ We capped the annual incentive award payout  at target if total shareholder return is not positive during the year. 
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◆ You encouraged us to continue our refreshment process of our  board of directors and, in particular, to reflect age and gender diversity.◆ In February 2018, Mr. Sawyer joined  our board. As the Company announced in July 2018, Mr. Edwards notified the board of directors of his intention to retire from the board at the expiration of his current term. In March 2019, Ms. Singh-Bushell was nominated to the board with  her election to be voted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. More information regarding Mr. Sawyer and Ms. Singh-Bushell can be found in the board of directors section of this Proxy Statement. We remain committed to continuing our structured  multi-year board refreshment process. 
◆ You would like to see the stock ownership requirements for the  CEO and non-employee directors be more in line with the Companys peers.◆ We increased the stock ownership  requirements for the CEO and non-employee directors to 5X base salary or annual cash retainer, respectively. 
[END TABLE]
More details concerning our compensation plans can be found in the CD&A section of this Proxy Statement. The board and management remain focused on generating superior shareholder returns through the realization of Huron's long-term strategy. We are collectively focused on driving Huron to sustainable organic revenue growth while increasing margins and deploying capital strategically to strengthen Huron's competitive position and maximize shareholder value. As a consulting firm, our people are our assets. We believe that Huron's culture, which focuses on a strong mission and vision, and the Company's values of humility, inclusion, intellectual curiosity, integrity, impact, collaboration and excellence, create an attractive environment for our people and our clients, and therefore provides the Company with a strong competitive advantage. Finally, while still early, we are seeing the results of our five-year strategy taking hold as the Company returned to organic revenue growth in 2018. This is also reflected in a stock price increase in excess of 25% during 2018. 
Our Say on Pay Proposal is found in Proposal 3 of this Proxy Statement, and the board recommends that you vote 'FOR' this proposal. We also invite you to consider additional information on our compensation philosophy and decisions in the CD&A. We are confident that our programs are designed to pay for performance and are aligned with shareholder interests. 
We are also requesting additional shares for our Long-Term Incentive Program. We annually grant a sizable portion of equity to our managing directors. An average of 76% of total equity granted in the last three years was awarded to our non-NEO managing directors. As a professional services firm, we recognize that our managing directors are critical to developing and maintaining client relationships, generating revenue and driving the overall success of Huron. We use stock as both a retention tool and an incentive to encourage behaviors that will benefit our shareholders and the Company. Approximately 50% of the annual bonus compensation of our Practice Leaders and client-facing managing directors consists of restricted stock that vests over four years and is awarded based on prior-year performance. We believe this element of our compensation aligns the interests of each of our businesses with the Company as a whole and importantly differentiates Huron's compensation program from our competitors by aligning our managing directors with Huron's long-term value creation. We ask that you vote in favor of Proposal 2. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Huron Consulting Group Inc. (the "Company," "Huron," "we" or "us"). The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") will be held on Friday, May 3, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. Central Time, at the Company's corporate headquarters located at 550 West Van Buren Street, Chicago, Illinois 60607. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card are first being mailed to stockholders on or about March 22, 2019. 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING 
QUORUM AND VOTING REQUIREMENTS
The Company has one class of common stock. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 22,880,993 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
The accompanying proxy is solicited from the holders of record of the common stock on behalf of the board of directors of the Company and is revocable at any time by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company prior to the Annual Meeting or by executing and delivering a later-dated proxy by mail prior to the Annual Meeting. Furthermore, the stockholders of record who are present at the Annual Meeting may revoke their proxies and vote in person. 
If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, you will receive proxy materials from your bank or broker, which will include a voting instruction form. If you would like to revoke voting instructions given to your bank or broker, you must follow its instructions. If you would like to attend the Annual Meeting and vote these shares in person, you must obtain a proxy from your bank or broker. You must request the proxy from your bank or broker; it will not automatically supply one to you. 
All shares of the Company's common stock represented by properly executed and unrevoked proxies will be voted by the proxies in accordance with the directions given therein. Where no instructions are indicated, properly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement for consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
A quorum, consisting of at least one-third of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted. Shares of common stock entitled to vote and represented by properly executed, returned and unrevoked proxies, including shares with respect to which votes are withheld, abstentions are cast or there are broker non-votes on some proposals but not others, will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Company's third amended and restated certificate of incorporation divides the Company's board of directors into three classes, with each class being elected to a three-year term. 
The board of directors has nominated John McCartney, James H. Roth and Ekta Singh-Bushell as Class III Directors to be voted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. H. Eugene Lockhart and George E. Massaro are Class I Directors serving terms ending at the 2020 Annual Meeting. John S. Moody, Hugh E. Sawyer and Debra Zumwalt are Class II Directors serving terms ending at the 2021 Annual Meeting. Mr. Edwards previously notified the board of directors of his intention to retire from the board as a Class III Director at the expiration of his current term, as the Company announced on July 27, 2018. 
This Proxy Statement relates only to the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders with respect to the election of the three nominees as Class III Directors and the other matters described herein. The board of directors knows of no reason that Mr. McCartney, Mr. Roth and Ms. Singh-Bushell might be unavailable to serve as the Class III Directors, and each has expressed an intention to serve, if elected. If Mr. McCartney, Mr. Roth or Ms. Singh-Bushell is unable to serve, the shares represented by all valid proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of such substitute nominee as the board of directors may recommend. There are no arrangements or understandings between any of the persons nominated to be a Class III Director and any other person pursuant to which any of such nominees was selected. 
The election of a director requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting that are voted, provided that a quorum is represented at the meeting. A "plurality" means that the individuals who receive the largest number of votes are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at the meeting. Therefore, abstentions and "broker non-votes" will have no impact on the election of directors. Properly executed proxies submitted pursuant to this solicitation will be voted "FOR" the election of Mr. McCartney, Mr. Roth and Ms. Singh-Bushell as Class III Directors, unless specified otherwise. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF MR. MCCARTNEY, MR. ROTH AND MS. SINGH-BUSHELL AS CLASS III DIRECTORS.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Our board of directors makes an annual determination regarding the independence of each of our directors. The board also makes this determination for new director nominees. The board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Edwards, Lockhart, Massaro, McCartney, Moody, Ms. Zumwalt and Ms. Singh-Bushell is 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  Mr. Roth also served as President until February 2019.  
[END TABLE]
  "independent" as defined in the applicable listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market Inc. ("NASDAQ"). In making its determination, the board of directors considered the standards of independence set forth in the NASDAQ Corporate Governance Listing Standards and all relevant facts and circumstances to ascertain whether there was any relationship between a director or nominee and the Company that, in the opinion of the board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of the director or any material relationship with the Company (either directly, or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). In determining that Ms. Zumwalt is independent, the board of directors conducted a thorough review of payments made by Stanford University, which employs Ms. Zumwalt, to the Company for consulting services provided by the Company. After taking into consideration that revenues from Stanford University comprised 0.14% of Huron's revenues for the year 2018, 0.12% of Huron's revenues for the year 2017 and 0.60% for the year 2016, the board of directors determined that this relationship would not interfere with Ms. Zumwalt's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out her responsibilities as a director. Mr. Sawyer previously served as a managing director at Huron, beginning in January 2010, and led the Operational Improvement Service Line for Huron's Business Advisory Practice until 2017, and, therefore, is not deemed independent. 
BOARD COMPOSITION, LEADERSHIP STRUCTUREAND RISK OVERSIGHT 
BOARD COMPOSITION
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in conjunction with the Chair and the full board, is actively evaluating the future composition of the board in light of the age, tenure and experience of its current members. This multi-year refresh process is intended to ensure that the board has the best mix of knowledge, skills and business acumen, derived from high quality professional experience, to evaluate and support the Company's strategy going forward. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that its current directors, several of whom have extensive experience leading and managing professional service businesses, provide significant insight into the Company and its operations and provide valuable contributions to the board. The Committee also recognizes the potential benefits of the fresh perspectives that highly qualified new directors might bring to the board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider a variety of factors as it works to enhance the composition of the board, increase diversity, reduce average tenure and ensure structured and orderly board succession through a process of both board member additions and retirements. As a result, during the next several years, the board may occasionally expand or contract as the refresh process is executed. It is the expressed desire of the board that it continue to remain relatively small in number and composed principally of non-executive directors. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider as director candidates qualified individuals recommended by stockholders through the process described below and, although it has not done so in the past, may consider candidates identified by professional search firms. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP 
Huron formally separated the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 2010. Our Non-executive Chairman is John McCartney and our Chief Executive Officer is James H. Roth. As Non-executive Chairman, Mr. McCartney, in consultation with Mr. Roth, develops the agendas for board meetings, determines the appropriate scheduling for board meetings, assesses the quality, quantity and timeliness of information provided from management to the board, assists the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in monitoring and implementing our Corporate Governance Guidelines and otherwise takes steps to ensure that the board is acting in the long-term best interests of the Company. Mr. McCartney also chairs executive sessions of the board. In addition, George E. Massaro serves as Vice Chairman. 
The board has determined that our current board leadership structure is appropriate for the Company, as it believes the separation of powers is beneficial for our organization.  RISK OVERSIGHT 
One of the board's responsibilities is to review the adequacy of the Company's systems for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, for safeguarding the Company's assets and for managing the major risks it faces. The board executes its responsibility for risk management directly and through its committees in a variety of ways, including the following: 
BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES 
The board of directors conducts its business through meetings of the full board, actions taken by written consent in lieu of meetings, and by the actions of its committees. During 2018, the board of directors held nine meetings. 
During 2018, each board member attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of board meetings and meetings of all the committees on which the director served. Although the Company does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual meetings, we encourage directors to attend. All of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The board of directors operates in part through its three committees: Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance. All committee members are "independent" as defined in the applicable listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, all Compensation Committee members are "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). All Audit Committee members meet the criteria for independence set forth in SEC Rule 10A-3(b)(1). A detailed discussion of each committee's mission, composition and responsibilities is contained within the committee charters available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's web site at www.huronconsultinggroup.com.  Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee responsibilities include overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of our financial statements, and the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight and evaluation of the work of any registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing audit, review or attest services for us. As such, the Audit Committee approves audit and permitted non-audit services and applicable fees. The Audit Committee met seven times in 2018. The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Lockhart (Chair), McCartney and Moody. The board of directors has determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and auditing matters to serve on the Audit Committee. The board of directors has also determined that each of Messrs. Lockhart, McCartney and Moody is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the applicable securities regulations, and that each member of the Audit Committee satisfies the applicable NASDAQ listing standards for audit committee membership. 
The Report of the Audit Committee for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 appears below under the caption "PROPOSAL 4—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM—Report of the Audit Committee." 
Compensation Committee 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee responsibilities include overseeing our compensation and benefit plans, including all compensation arrangements for executive officers and directors, each of which the Compensation Committee reviews annually and makes changes as it deems appropriate. The Compensation Committee met seven times in 2018. The members of the Compensation Committee are Ms. Zumwalt (Chair), Mr. Lockhart and Mr. Moody. 
Management assists the Compensation Committee in the performance of its duties as described in more detail below under "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Role of Management." In addition, during 2018, the CEO participated in all of the Compensation Committee's meetings and in all of the executive sessions, except for those in which the Compensation Committee considered the CEO's performance, compensation and incentives. The Committee engaged the firm of Pay Governance LLC as its outside compensation advisor to assist the Committee in the execution of its charter. The support provided by the advisor is described in more detail below under "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Role of Compensation Advisor." The Report of the Compensation Committee on Executive Compensation appears below under the caption "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION—Compensation Committee Report." 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee responsibilities include identifying and recommending to the board of directors appropriate director nominee candidates and providing oversight with respect to corporate governance matters. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met four times in 2018. 
The members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Mr. Edwards (Chair), Mr. Massaro and Ms. Zumwalt. As noted above, Mr. Edwards is retiring from the board at the end of his current term. 
Directors may be nominated by the board of directors or by stockholders in accordance with the bylaws of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review all candidates for nomination to the board of directors, including those proposed by stockholders as provided below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the person's judgment, experience, independence, understanding of the Company's business or other related industries, and such other factors as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines are relevant in light of the needs of the board of directors and the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects qualified candidates and reviews its recommendations with the board of directors, which will decide whether to invite the candidate to be a nominee for election to the board of directors. 
If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receives a nominee recommendation in accordance with the rules of the SEC from a stockholder or group of stockholders that has beneficially owned more than 5% of the Company's voting common stock for at least one year as of the date of the recommendation, the name of the candidate, the name(s) of the stockholder(s) who recommended the candidate, and whether the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chose to nominate the candidate will be disclosed in the proxy statement, if the consent of both the stockholder and the candidate has been received.  For a stockholder to submit a candidate for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a stockholder must notify the Company's Corporate Secretary. In addition, the Company's bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors at a stockholders' meeting. To make a director nomination at the annual meeting, a stockholder must notify the Company's Corporate Secretary within the time periods specified under "SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS" below. Notices should be sent to: Corporate Secretary, Huron Consulting Group Inc., 550 West Van Buren Street, 17th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60607, or corporatesecretary@huronconsultinggroup.com. In either case, the notice must meet all of the requirements contained in the bylaws. 
DIVERSITY OF BOARD SKILLSAND EXPERIENCE 
Huron does not have a formal policy on board member diversity. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in discussing board composition, has focused on diversity of experience in relation to the development of the business, and believes it should reflect over time a diversity of gender, race, ethnicity and age, although the Committee follows no strict criteria when making decisions. In addition to the considerations mentioned above under the "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee" section, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates with prior management experience, experience on public company boards and in relevant industries. 
DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than "for" his or her election shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors following certification of the election results, subject to acceptance by the board of directors. For purposes of this policy, (i) an "uncontested" election is one in which the number of persons properly nominated for election as directors as of the date that is ten (10) days before the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting is not greater than the number of directors to be elected, and (ii) broker non-votes will not be counted as either votes "withheld" from or "for" such person's election. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall determine whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken, in its sole discretion, and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation within ninety (90) days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the board of directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. 
If any director's resignation is not accepted by the board of directors, such director shall continue to serve until such director's successor is duly elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this policy, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 2 of Article III of the bylaws of the Company or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to Section 1 of Article III of the bylaws of the Company. 
STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS POLICY 
The Company's board of directors has established a process for stockholders to send communications to the board of directors. Stockholders may communicate with any member of the board of directors, including the chairperson of any committee, an entire committee or the independent directors or all directors as a group, by sending written communications to: 
Corporate Secretary 
Huron Consulting Group Inc. 
550 West Van Buren Street 
17th Floor 
Chicago, Illinois 60607 
E-mail messages should be sent to corporatesecretary@huronconsultinggroup.com.  A stockholder must include his or her name and address in any such written or e-mail communication. The communication must indicate that the sender is a Company stockholder. 
Each communication intended for the board of directors and received by the Corporate Secretary that is related to the operation of the Company and is not otherwise commercial in nature will be forwarded to the specified party following its clearance through normal security procedures. If the communication is mailed as personal, it will not be opened, but rather will be forwarded unopened to the intended recipient. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
The Huron non-employee director compensation program is designed to enhance our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and to align their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. The program consists of both a cash component, designed to compensate non-employee directors for their service on the board and its committees, and an equity component, designed to align the interests of non-employee directors and stockholders. Mr. Roth receives no compensation for his service on the board.

   Compensation  Strategy   
 Our compensation philosophy has three key elements:     Motivate and reward performance in the long-term best interests  of shareholders.   Deliver competitive total compensation  generally targeted at the median of our peer group (+/-15%).   Place a substantial portion of the compensation of our named executive officers at risk; actual payouts should vary based on the Companys financial and operational performance. The performance  measures that determine our incentive awards, as approved annually by the Compensation Committee, are directly aligned with our business strategy and drive shareholder value.

 Business Results   
 Business Results   
   The Companys financial and strategic performance determines  the majority of our NEOs compensation.   2018 business  results were as follows4:     In 2018, we began executing against our new, enterprise-wide  strategy to drive sustainable organic growth and margin expansion over time. We also created a unified sense of purpose for our employees through a new vision, mission, set of values and brand positioning that align closely with our strategy.   We have evolved our strategic planning process and  organizational governance model to accelerate our ability to execute and more aggressively strengthen our competitive position.   Net revenues were $795.1 million in 2018, compared to  $732.6 million in the prior year, driven by 8% organic revenue growth.   As anticipated, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $91.0 million  in 2018, or 11.4% of revenues, compared to $104.6 million in 2017, or 14.3% of revenues. In 2016 and 2017, we experienced lower margins for two primary reasons. First, margins within our largest segment, Healthcare, declined as healthcare  providers shifted away from buying large, comprehensive performance improvement engagements that typically involved multiple service lines and a higher mix of performance-based fees to smaller, more discrete engagements involving a single service  line and a greater percentage of fixed fees at lower margin. Second, demand increased across all segments for our technology implementation offerings, which tend to have lower margins than other service offerings, resulting in a less favorable  margin mix of services. As a result of these challenges, bonus funding for our employees was at a low level in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to see increased demand for our services, particularly in the Healthcare segment. Healthcare  segment revenue increased more than 20% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2017 when we experienced record utilization of 84.5%. As the U.S. labor market strengthened, we concurrently saw increased competition for talent for our  consultants. In the interest of driving shareholder value for the long term, the Committee made the decision to establish 2018 EBITDA targets for each business that would make full bonus payouts possible if these revised financial targets were  achieved. This decision negatively affected 2018 EBITDA, but the Committee believes it was critical to the recruitment and retention of revenue-generating talent in a highly competitive market. The board believes the retention and recruitment of  talent is essential to our ability to grow revenues and expand margins over time, which will drive increased shareholder value.   We believe that the strategic positioning we developed in 2017 and executed in 2018 is taking hold. We grew Company-wide revenues 8%  organically for the full year 2018 and Healthcare segment revenues grew organically for the full year 2018, which is the first time this occurred since 2014. While there continues to be intense competition for talent, we believe we have been  successful at retaining our revenue-generating professionals and creating an attractive platform to recruit new talent. We have also benefited from the use of equity to retain our managing directors. Based on our Revenue Growth and  efficiency-focused initiatives at the practice level and the continued leveraging of our corporate SG&A expenses, the Company has planned for and guided to expanding margins in 2019 and the Compensation Committee has set the NEO compensation  targets accordingly.     Adjusted Diluted EPS was $2.08 in 2018, compared to $2.15 in 2017, reflecting the Adjusted EBITDA headwinds described above, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.   We also continued to align our corporate infrastructure with the  evolving needs of our business to gain efficiencies and leverage our SG&A expense, lowering SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 220 basis points in 2018, compared to 2017.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to see increased demand for our services, particularly in the Healthcare segment. Healthcare  segment revenue increased more than 20% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2017 when we experienced record utilization of 84.5%. As the U.S. labor market strengthened, we concurrently saw increased competition for talent for our  consultants. In the interest of driving shareholder value for the long term, the Committee made the decision to establish 2018 EBITDA targets for each business that would make full bonus payouts possible if these revised financial targets were  achieved. This decision negatively affected 2018 EBITDA, but the Committee believes it was critical to the recruitment and retention of revenue-generating talent in a highly competitive market. The board believes the retention and recruitment of  talent is essential to our ability to grow revenues and expand margins over time, which will drive increased shareholder value.   We believe that the strategic positioning we developed in 2017 and executed in 2018 is taking hold. We grew Company-wide revenues 8%  organically for the full year 2018 and Healthcare segment revenues grew organically for the full year 2018, which is the first time this occurred since 2014. While there continues to be intense competition for talent, we believe we have been  successful at retaining our revenue-generating professionals and creating an attractive platform to recruit new talent. We have also benefited from the use of equity to retain our managing directors. Based on our Revenue Growth and  efficiency-focused initiatives at the practice level and the continued leveraging of our corporate SG&A expenses, the Company has planned for and guided to expanding margins in 2019 and the Compensation Committee has set the NEO compensation  targets accordingly.     Adjusted Diluted EPS was $2.08 in 2018, compared to $2.15 in 2017, reflecting the Adjusted EBITDA headwinds described above, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.   We also continued to align our corporate infrastructure with the  evolving needs of our business to gain efficiencies and leverage our SG&A expense, lowering SG&A as a percentage of revenue by 220 basis points in 2018, compared to 2017.   
   The Companys financial and strategic performance determines  the majority of our NEOs compensation.   2018 business  results were as follows4:     In 2018, we began executing against our new, enterprise-wide  strategy to drive sustainable organic growth and margin expansion over time. We also created a unified sense of purpose for our employees through a new vision, mission, set of values and brand positioning that align closely with our strategy.   We have evolved our strategic planning process and  organizational governance model to accelerate our ability to execute and more aggressively strengthen our competitive position.   Net revenues were $795.1 million in 2018, compared to  $732.6 million in the prior year, driven by 8% organic revenue growth.   As anticipated, Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $91.0 million  in 2018, or 11.4% of revenues, compared to $104.6 million in 2017, or 14.3% of revenues. In 2016 and 2017, we experienced lower margins for two primary reasons. First, margins within our largest segment, Healthcare, declined as healthcare  providers shifted away from buying large, comprehensive performance improvement engagements that typically involved multiple service lines and a higher mix of performance-based fees to smaller, more discrete engagements involving a single service  line and a greater percentage of fixed fees at lower margin.

4  In the discussion of the Company's 2018 performance, the Compensation Committee discusses certain of  Huron's results of operations using non-GAAP financial measures, which are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K"), Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the subheading "Non-GAAP Measures." These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS. EBITDA is  defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted by adding back restructuring charges, other gains and losses, non-operating income and expense, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net revenues. Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted  earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations adjusted by adding back the same items as adjusted EBITDA, in addition to amortization of intangible assets, non-cash interest on convertible notes, all on  a tax effected basis, as well as tax expense related to the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

 Impact of Results on NEO Compensation   
 Impact of Results on NEO Compensation   
[END TABLE]
Our compensation philosophy and incentive plan design strive to incentivize management by aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. In 2018, approximately 80% of total direct compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and approximately 67% on average for our other NEOs, was performance-based and not guaranteed. The graphs below illustrate this performance-based mix of pay components. 
In 2018, we were able to achieve a number of our annual incentive goals, including outperforming our Organic Revenue Growth goal. As a result, our NEOs earned 117% of their target annual incentive awards. However, our performance-based long-term incentive awards eligible to vest in 2018 were not earned, resulting in executives not realizing their full target equity award values. For 2018, our CEO's actual pay was 63% of target and on average our NEOs' actual pay was 73% of target. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to be aligned with shareholder value. This is reflected in a comparison of Mr. Roth's target and realizable compensation. The graph below illustrates the target compensation opportunity provided to Mr. Roth from 2014-2018, the compensation he has earned, and the compensation he still has the potential to earn over this same period (LTI At-Risk). The realizable compensation values are compared with our TSR performance over the same period. Mr. Roth's reduced target opportunity for 2019 is presented on the right side of the chart for additional context.  Realizable pay includes salary, actual annual incentive earned and equity incentives earned or remaining eligible to be earned, valued at the December 31, 2018 share price. The shortfall between realizable pay and target pay can be attributed to lack of achievement of annual or long-term incentive goals, which resulted in target opportunity being forfeited, and the decline in share price. For all completed and known vesting and performance periods as of December 31, 2018, Mr. Roth had earned 62% of his target opportunity. The At-Risk portion outstanding is purposefully tied to the achievement of our strategic objectives and requires achievement of rigorous Adjusted Diluted EPS and Revenue Growth goals in order to be earned, which demonstrates the challenging nature of the incentive goals set by the board.

Shareholder Outreach 
We contacted shareholders representing ownership of over 70% of our shares outstanding to solicit their feedback and sought their input related to our NEO compensation programs. Shareholders representing 41% of our shares outstanding agreed to meet with us. These engagements took place after the annual shareholder meeting and the primary focus was on the NEO compensation program and on governance. These discussions were facilitated by our Chair of the board, Mr. John McCartney, and Chair of our Compensation Committee, Ms. Debra Zumwalt, with assistance from our CFO, Mr. John Kelly. While these meetings provided the opportunity for Mr. McCartney and Ms. Zumwalt to share the board's rationale behind the NEO compensation decisions, the majority of the time was spent listening to shareholders' views.

The 2018 EBITDA target was set below the 2017 actual EBITDA performance level 
The Compensation Committee and management discuss the business plan and related goals over the course of multiple meetings. Goals are set in consideration of our business plan and are intended to reflect a considerable amount of stretch, while remaining achievable. While our EBITDA Margin goal for 2018 was below the prior year's actual level of performance, NEOs only achieved a threshold level of performance in 2017, for which a 25% of target award was earned. 
In 2016 and 2017, we experienced lower margins for two primary reasons. First, margins within our largest segment, Healthcare, declined as healthcare providers shifted away from buying large, comprehensive performance improvement engagements that typically involved multiple service lines and a higher mix of performance-based fees to smaller, more discrete engagements involving a single service line and a greater percentage of fixed fees at lower margin. Second, demand increased across all segments for our technology implementation offerings, which tend to have lower margins than other service offerings, resulting in a less favorable margin mix of services. As a result of these challenges, bonus funding for our employees was at a low level in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to see increased demand for our services, particularly in the Healthcare segment. Healthcare segment revenue increased more than 20% sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2017 when we experienced record utilization of 84.5%. As the U.S. labor market strengthened, we concurrently saw increased competition for talent for our consultants. In the interest of driving shareholder value for the long term, the Committee made the decision to establish 2018 EBITDA targets for each business that would make full bonus payouts possible if these revised financial targets were achieved. This decision negatively affected 2018 EBITDA, but the Committee believes it was critical to the recruitment and retention of revenue-generating talent in a highly competitive market. The board believes the retention and recruitment of talent is essential to our ability to grow revenues and expand margins over time, which will drive increased shareholder value. 
We believe that the strategic positioning we developed in 2017 and executed in 2018 is taking hold. We grew Company-wide revenues 8% organically for the full year 2018 and Healthcare segment revenues grew organically for the full year 2018, which is the first time this occurred since 2014. While there continues to be intense competition for talent, we believe we have been successful at retaining our revenue-generating professionals and creating an attractive platform to recruit new talent. We have also benefited from the use of equity as well to retain our managing directors. Based on our revenue growth and efficiency-focused initiatives at the practice level and the continued leveraging of our corporate SG&A expenses, the Company has planned for and guided to expanding margins in 2019 and the Compensation Committee has set the NEO compensation targets accordingly.  Targeting of Total Direct Compensation 
The Compensation Committee generally targets total direct compensation to be within +/-15% of the median of the Executive Pay Peer Group for our NEOs. In addition to peer group data, the Compensation Committee also reviews survey data for companies with revenues between $500M and $1B from the Radford Global Technology Survey. The Compensation Committee considers Huron's competition for talent to be broader than just the peer group companies, including other public and private consulting, strategy and also technology organizations, for the NEOs as well as our managing directors. When making compensation determinations, the Compensation Committee applies its judgment in incorporating these various factors. 
2018 NEO Compensation Opportunity 
The Compensation Committee approved 2018 compensation levels (base salary and target annual and long-term incentive) in February of 2018. The only changes approved for 2018 were to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly's base salary and long-term incentive opportunity increased given he is at the lower end of the comparator range. The Compensation Committee will continue to review competitiveness on an annual basis.

2018 Annual Incentive 
The Compensation Committee approved a NEO Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 that included multiple measures of Company performance. Based on the actual results for each of the performance measures, a total annual cash incentive payout of 117% of target was earned. 
The 2018 Annual Incentive Plan was structured as shown in the table below:

2019 NEO Compensation Program 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee made the following compensation adjustments: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Roth's LTI award was reduced to 225% of salary, reducing his target total compensation opportunity by nearly  15% in response to shareholder concerns.  
• Mr. Kelly's base salary increased from $400,000 to $460,000 and long-term incentive opportunity increased from  125% to 150%. This change was part of a multi-year strategy to position his pay closer to market median as this is his third year in the role.  
• There were no other compensation changes for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
The 2019 Annual Incentive Program design is summarized in the table below. Changes to the design from 2018 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reducing the weighting of the Strategic Measures from 30% to 20% at target.  
• Increasing the weighting of Adjusted EBITDA Margin from 30% to 40%.  
[END TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee has also implemented a cap under the annual incentive program, limiting actual awards to target payout if TSR is not positive for 2019.

[END TABLE]
No changes were made to the Long-Term Incentive Program for 2019.  Executive Pay Peer Group 
The peer group for 2018 was identified based on the following process: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  All companies were identified that met the following criteria:  
• U.S. headquartered and publicly traded.  
• Revenue between one-half to two times Huron's trailing 12 months'  revenue.  
• Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes: Research and Consulting Services, Human Resource &  Employment Services, Application Software, Health Care Services or Technology, or Data Processing and Outsourced Services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Companies were then screened and selected that best met the following set of factors:  
• Business and/or labor market competitor to Huron.  
• Similar revenue per employee.  
• Predominantly U.S. revenue.  
• Principal business was to provide value-added consulting or advisory services to companies and organizations.   
[END TABLE]
As a result of the review and application of these criteria, the Compensation Committee approved modifications for the 2018 peer group—removing Gartner and MAXIMUS to better reflect our scope and reduce the median revenues of the peer sample to be closer to those of Huron. The 2018 peer group consisted of the following 15 companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Acxiom Corporation       Heidrick & Struggles International, Inc.

[END TABLE]
In addition to peer group data, the Compensation Committee also reviews survey data for companies with revenues between $500M and $1B from the Radford Global Technology Survey. The Compensation Committee considers Huron's competition for talent to be broader than just the peer group companies, including other public and private consulting, strategy and also technology organizations, for the NEOs as well as our managing directors. When making compensation determinations, the Compensation Committee applies its judgment in incorporating these various factors. 
Employment Agreements with Mr. Roth, Mr. Hussey, Mr. Kelly and Ms. Ratekin 
Huron has entered into agreements with each of the named executive officers that provide for benefits upon termination of employment under certain circumstances, including in connection with a change of control of the Company. Huron provides these benefits as a means of remaining competitive, retaining executive officers, focusing executive officers on shareholder interests when considering strategic alternatives, and providing income protection in the event of involuntary loss of employment. In general, these arrangements provide for severance benefits upon Huron's termination of the executive's employment without cause or resignation by the executive for good reason (constructive termination). In the event of a change of control of Huron and if the executive's employment is terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason, the executive will receive enhanced severance benefits. Huron provides these enhanced severance benefits only with a "double trigger" because the Company believes that the executive officers would be materially harmed in a change of control only if it results in reduced responsibilities or compensation or loss of employment for the executive. Huron employment agreements do not provide for any gross-ups.  More information on our use of employment agreements, including the estimated payments and benefits payable to the named executive officers, is provided under the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" section of this Proxy Statement. 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for administering our executive compensation program in a manner consistent with our compensation philosophy and objectives. The principal functions of the Compensation Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• set salaries and annual and long-term incentive levels for the CEO and other named executive officers, so that the  program is promoting shareholder value;  
• evaluate annually the performance of the CEO (in coordination with the full board) and review the CEO evaluations of  the other named executive officers;  
• review and approve the design and competitiveness of our compensation plans, executive benefits and perquisites;   
• review and approve the total cash and stock bonus pools for the organization, and approve the individual incentive  payout awards for the named executive officers;  
• review director compensation and make recommendations to the board;  
• review and approve goals used for the annual and long-term incentive plans;  
• retain or terminate, in its sole discretion, any independent compensation consultant used to assist the Compensation  Committee;  
• review and evaluate compensation arrangements to assess whether they could encourage undue risk taking; and   
• create a Compensation Committee report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee acts independently, and works closely with our board of directors and the executive management team, in making many of its decisions. To support its decision making, the Compensation Committee has retained the services of an independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to amend or terminate the services of its independent consultant. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee was comprised entirely of independent directors, none of whom has at any time been an officer or employee of the Company. 
Role of Management 
Our CEO works together with the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Compensation Committee of our board to establish, review and evaluate compensation packages and policies for our executive officers. Our CEO reviews the performance of each named executive officer and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on his review. Our CEO, COO, CFO and General Counsel provide input into our strategic goals for future performance periods. The Compensation Committee carefully reviews all information before finalizing incentive goals, however, as we believe such a process is consistent with good governance. Prior to determining the size of the bonus pool for all employees other than NEOs, management reviews Company and practice-level performance with the board so that the bonus pool and Company profitability strike the right balance between shareholder returns and retention of employees. Our CEO does not participate in any discussions related to his own compensation. 
Role of Compensation Advisor 
The Compensation Committee retains an independent advisor to assist in the ongoing assessment of our executive compensation strategy and program. The Committee's independent advisor reports directly to the Compensation Committee and serves at its sole discretion and does not perform any services for the Company other than those in connection with its work for the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance served as the Compensation Committee's independent advisor for the second half of 2017, during which 2018 pay decisions were made, and in 2018, during which 2019 pay decisions were made. 
The Compensation Committee annually assesses whether the independent advisor's work has raised any conflict of interest. The Compensation Committee has determined, based on its analysis of NASDAQ requirements, that the work of Pay Governance and the individual compensation advisors employed by Pay Governance as compensation consultants to the Company has not created any conflict of interest.  2018 Say on Pay Vote 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 40% of shareholder votes were cast in support of the named executive officer compensation. As we have discussed herein, we took this response from our shareholders very seriously. We engaged with many shareholders and made program design changes to incorporate their feedback. We will continue to listen carefully to our shareholders and incorporate their feedback into our deliberations about executive compensation. Between 2011 to 2017, an average of 98.5% of the votes cast on Say on Pay were in favor of the fiscal year compensation of our named executive officers. 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
The named executive officers are eligible for the same health and welfare benefits generally available to Huron employees. 
Deferred Compensation 
The Company also offers a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the "DCP") to all managing directors, corporate vice presidents, named executive officers and non-employee directors. The DCP allows participants to elect to defer up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of their annual cash incentive into a deferred compensation account and to choose from a number of investment alternatives. Non-employee directors may elect to defer up to 100% of their board fees into the DCP. 
Perquisites 
Huron did not provide material perquisites that are not provided widely within Huron to any named executive officer in 2018. The Company provides enhanced disability and life insurance benefits to all of its managing directors, corporate vice presidents and executive officers. Named executive officers and practice leaders are also offered reimbursement of the cost of an annual executive physical examination. 
Clawback Provisions 
In 2014, we adopted an incentive compensation recoupment policy (commonly referred to as a "clawback policy") that provides for the potential recoupment of bonuses or awards paid to executive officers and such other individuals designated by our non-employee directors under our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans, where the payout or actual award received was determined based in part on the financial performance of the Company. In the event of a material restatement of our quarterly or annual financial results, our non-employee directors will review all incentive compensation awarded to those individuals covered by the policy based upon the achievement of financial results that were the subject of the restatement. The non-employee directors have the authority to recoup all or a portion of the incentive compensation to the extent that the amount of such compensation would have been lower than the amount actually awarded, granted, paid, earned, deferred or vested based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently reduced due to such restatement. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Requirements 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee revised stock ownership guidelines for Huron's named executive officers and non-employee directors. The guidelines, set forth below, are consistent with peer practices and designed to promote alignment with the interests of stockholders and the Company's commitment to sound corporate governance. 
The Compensation Committee made three changes to the guidelines in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased the required CEO guideline from 3X to 5X base salary  
• Increased the required non-employee director guideline from 3X to 5X annual  retainer for all non-employee directors  
• Removed the "lesser of" provision, which had previously required ownership of a multiple of salary or a  defined number of shares - whichever was less  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO    5x salary 
 COO and CFO    2x salary 
 Other Executive Officers    1x salary 
 Non-employee  Directors    5x annual retainer 
[END TABLE]
 Until the relevant stock ownership target is achieved, executive officers and non-employee directors are required to retain a number of shares equal to at least 60% of the net after tax proceeds from the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock and performance units. Only shares owned outright count towards ownership requirements. Unexercised stock options and unvested performance units or unvested restricted stock do not count. All of our NEOs and non-employee directors are in compliance with the terms of our share ownership guidelines. 
Hedging and Pledging 
The Company has an insider trading policy that prohibits directors, officers, employees and contractors from entering into transactions in publicly traded puts, calls or other derivative securities with respect to Huron's stock and prohibits any other transaction that "hedges" the ownership in Huron's stock or holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in excess of $1 million for any fiscal year to a company's chief executive officer or other named executive officers (excluding the company's principal financial officer, in the case of tax years commencing before 2018). However, in the case of tax years commencing before 2018, the statute exempted qualifying performance-based compensation from the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Section 162(m) was amended in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to eliminate the exemption for performance-based compensation (other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017) and to expand the group of current and former executive officers who may be covered by the deduction limit under Section 162(m). While the Company's shareholder approved incentive plans were previously structured to provide that certain awards could be made in a manner intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation exemption, that exemption will no longer be available for future tax years (other than with respect to certain "grandfathered" arrangements as noted above). In addition, while the Compensation Committee intended that certain incentive awards granted to our NEOs on or prior to November 2, 2017 be deductible as "performance-based compensation" and has assessed the possibility that certain awards will be grandfathered from the changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it cannot guarantee that result. The Compensation Committee has taken the potential impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into consideration when approving payout amounts for performance periods ending on December 31, 2018. The Compensation Committee expects in the future to authorize compensation in excess of $1 million to named executive officers that will not be deductible under Section 162(m) when it believes doing so is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Section 280G. Section 280G of the Code disallows a company's tax deduction for certain payments in connection with a change of control defined as "excess parachute payments," and Section 4999 of the Code imposes a 20% excise tax on certain persons who receive excess parachute payments. The Compensation Committee amended Senior Management Agreements in 2010 to ensure that any covered payments would be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of such payments is subject to the excise tax. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the information contained under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and, based on this review and discussion, has recommended to the board of directors that it be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Company is providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median-paid employee to the annual total compensation of Mr. Roth, our CEO. We believe that the pay ratio disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
For 2018, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of our median employee, was $121,004.  
• Mr. Roth's annual total compensation, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy  Statement, was $4,791,261.  
• Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Roth to the annual total compensation  of our median employee is estimated to be 39.6 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total compensation for all individuals using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2018. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We annualized the base compensation and bonus for all employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018 unless they were designated as temporary or seasonal positions. 
In addition, in order to identify our median employee, we (i) utilized the exemption permitted under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K to exclude a total of 142 employees from Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Switzerland (which, in the aggregate, comprised less than 5% of our total employee population as of December 31, 2018), resulting in a net employee population of 3,195 and (ii) adjusted non-U.S. employee pay applying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018. 
We identified our median employee for the 2017 Proxy Statement by calculating total compensation exclusive of one-time, special and retention awards. For the 2018 Proxy Statement, we included all forms of compensation, including one-time, special and retention awards to identify our median employee. This resulted in identifying a median employee with compensation substantially similar to that of our median employee in the prior year. 
After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  2018 GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS 
The following table summarizes the grants of equity awards and annual cash incentive awards for 2018 to each named executive officer.

(2)  The 2018 grant of Performance Share Units (PSUs) is based on performance (Adjusted Diluted EPS and Revenue Growth) over  a three-year period from 2018-2020. The PSUs are earned from 25% of target for threshold performance to 200% of target for maximum performance; however, if threshold performance is not achieved, the award will be forfeited. The PSUs that are earned  will vest on March 1, 2021.  
(3)  Restricted stock granted under the Company's 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan.  
(4)  The full grant date fair value of the March 1, 2018 restricted stock and PSU grants are based on the closing price  of Huron stock of $35.25 on March 1, 2018.

(1)  There were no executive contributions made to the DCP for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The Company maintains the DCP, which became effective July 1, 2006. The DCP permits managing directors, corporate vice presidents and named executive officers to elect to defer up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of their annual cash incentive into a deferred compensation account and to choose from a number of generally available investment vehicles. Earnings are credited based on earnings of the investment options selected by the participant. Huron does not match any amounts deferred or otherwise contribute to the DCP except to make restoration payments to the accounts of participants who do not receive the maximum eligible 401(k) match as a result of participation in the DCP. Deferral elections for base salary and any guaranteed bonus must be made in the calendar year prior to earning such base salary or within 30 days of becoming eligible for the plan. The Company requires that deferral elections of the annual cash incentive must be made 12 months prior to the end of the applicable performance period. Non-employee directors may also defer up to 100% of their retainer and meeting fees into the DCP. 
Payments from the plan automatically begin upon termination of employment or separation from service as a director. Key employees, including executive officers, must wait six months after termination to receive payment from the plan. Participants may elect payment in a lump sum or annual installments for up to 15 years. Upon proof of financial hardship and approval from the Compensation Committee, a participant may be allowed an early distribution. Participants may also elect to receive payments prior to termination through a scheduled distribution.

[END TABLE]
Background 
We have entered into agreements and maintain plans and arrangements that require us to pay or provide compensation and benefits to each of the named executive officers in the event of certain terminations of employment or a change of control. After a comprehensive review of the agreements in 2016, the Company entered into Amended and Restated Agreements with each of our NEOs, effective as of January 1, 2017. The provisions of these agreements, summarized below, are aligned with best practices. 
Senior Management Agreements 
Mr. Roth's agreement covers a term beginning on January 1, 2017, and continues for three years from that date. Following the expiration of that initial three-year term, his agreement will be automatically renewed every year, unless Mr. Roth or the Company provides 60 days' notice to the other that such automatic renewal shall cease. The agreement may be earlier terminated by Mr. Roth or the Company pursuant to its terms. 
Mr. Hussey, Mr. Kelly and Ms. Ratekin's agreements provide that employment will continue unless either the Company or the executive delivers to the other 60 days' advance written notice of the cessation of employment. These may be earlier terminated by the executive or the Company pursuant to their terms. 
The following table summarizes how unvested equity awards will be addressed in the event of a termination under the Senior Management Agreements that were in effect during 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Normal Vesting   33% annual vesting over 3 years for awards granted on or after 3/15/2017; 25% annual vesting over 4 years for those awards granted prior to 3/15/2017 and  for the award granted to C. Mark Hussey on 8/21/2017.    One-Year Performance Units: 33% of earned One-Year Performance Shares vest in each of Q1 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Golden Parachute Cutback 
All four Senior Management Agreements provide that, if any amount, right or benefit paid or payable to the executive under his or her Senior Management Agreement or any other plan, program or arrangement would constitute an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code, subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then the amount of payments payable to the executive under his or her Senior Management Agreement will be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of such payments is subject to such excise tax. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATIONOR CHANGE OF CONTROL 
The estimated amount payable or provided to each named executive officer in each situation is summarized below. These estimates are based on the assumption that the various triggering events occurred on the last day of 2018, along with other material assumptions noted below. The actual amounts that would be paid to a named executive officer upon termination or a change of control can only be determined at the time the actual triggering event occurs. The estimated amount of compensation and benefits described below does not take into account compensation and benefits that a named executive officer has earned prior to the applicable triggering event, such as equity awards that have previously vested in accordance with their terms or vested benefits otherwise payable under our compensation programs.  The following table and summary set forth potential payments we would be required to make to our named executive officers upon termination of employment or change of control. The table assumes termination of employment on December 31, 2018 and uses a share price of $51.31, the closing price of our stock on December 31, 2018.

(1)  Pro rata bonus for termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason is based on actual performance from 2018.  For retirement eligible individuals, executive would receive the full bonus earned payable at the originally scheduled payout date consistent with other executives and thus is not included in the table.

(2)  The acceleration of equity varies by grant and type of termination as outlined in the preceding sections. The value  shown is equal to the number of accelerated shares times the closing price on the last day of the fiscal year. These amounts do not include the value of stock that continues to vest per the original schedule post termination, including:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  A portion of the 2018 performance units would continue to vest for each of the named executive officers with the number  of shares determined based on actual performance through December 31, 2020 and prorated for the number of days that the executive was employed during the performance period.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During 2018, there were no Compensation Committee interlocks and no insider participation in Compensation Committee decisions that were required to be reported under the rules and regulations of the 1934 Act. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to review and approve, ratify or disapprove proposed transactions or courses of dealings with respect to which executive officers or directors or members of their immediate families have an interest (including all transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to the SEC's related person disclosure requirements). In addition, it is the policy of management and board members to discuss at a meeting of the board of directors, or the appropriate board committee, those transactions requiring disclosure pursuant to the SEC's related person disclosure requirements between Huron and a board member or a principal stockholder and members of their immediate families. 
On and effective February 8, 2018, the board of directors of Huron elected Hugh E. Sawyer as a Class II Director of Huron, to serve until the May 2018 Annual Meeting, at which time he was re-elected as a director by Huron's shareholders. Since April 2017, Mr. Sawyer has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director, of Regis Corporation ("Regis"), a company that owns, franchises and operates beauty salons worldwide. Prior to that, Mr. Sawyer served as a managing director at Huron. 
The Company has provided general business advisory and transaction advisory services to Regis beginning in 2016. The aggregate revenues from Regis were $299,164 in 2018 and $462 through February, 2019. 
In addition, Huron has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Conduct"), a copy of which is posted on our web site at www.huronconsultinggroup.com, that applies to directors and employees and their family members. The Code of Conduct, among other things, has a policy governing conflicts of interest generally and, in particular, prohibiting certain business arrangements with the Company and clients of the Company, entering into relationships that may be perceived as impairing the ability of the individual or Huron from performing his or its duties, as the case may be, in an impartial manner, and use of corporate property for improper personal gain. Any exceptions require disclosure and approval by the Chief Compliance Officer and, in the case of officers and directors, by the Audit Committee of the board of directors. The Code of Conduct also prohibits Huron from making any personal loans or guaranteeing any personal obligations of board members and executive officers.  PROPOSAL 2 
TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
Background and Reasons for Amending the Plan 
The board of directors believes that the continued growth and profitability of the Company depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Our Amended and Restated 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") was approved by stockholders at our 2012 annual meeting and authorized for issuance up to 1,398,204 shares of our common stock for stock-based incentive compensation to eligible employees, non-employee directors and independent contractors. At our 2014 annual meeting, stockholders approved and authorized an additional 850,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. At our 2017 annual meeting, stockholders approved and authorized an additional 804,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Plan. As of March 6, 2019, we had issued 1,608,392 shares of common stock under the Plan that are no longer subject to outstanding awards, 1,107,917 shares of common stock that are subject to unexercised options or unvested restricted stock awards and up to 412,660 shares that may be issued pursuant to outstanding performance share awards, leaving 451,971 shares of common stock available for grant. In addition, we have 117,680 shares of common stock that are subject to unexercised options under the 2004 Omnibus Stock Plan. The weighted average exercise price and remaining contractual life of the 154,297 total stock options outstanding from all plans were $30.52 and 2.34 years, respectively. The total number of unvested restricted stock awards and performance share awards outstanding from all plans was 1,366,280. See the summary table below.

[END TABLE]
In order to increase the number of shares of common stock available as equity compensation to our employees, non-employee directors, and independent contractors and those of our subsidiaries, our board of directors has approved an amendment to the Plan to increase the number of shares available for grant thereunder by 600,000 shares of common stock, subject to stockholder approval. We believe the additional shares authorized under the Plan will enable us to offer competitive compensation packages that reward performance while also creating a compelling reason to remain at Huron and deliver results that benefit all constituents. We annually grant a sizable portion of equity to our managing directors. (An average of 76% of total equity granted in the last three years was awarded to our managing directors; by contrast, approximately 19% of total equity granted in the last three years was awarded to our NEOs with the remaining 5% awarded to our directors and other employees.) As a professional services firm, we recognize that our managing directors are key to growing our business, generating revenue, enhancing our market reputation, and developing our people. As such, they are critical to the overall success of Huron. We use stock as both a retention tool and an incentive to encourage behaviors that will benefit our shareholders and the Company. Approximately 50% of the annual bonus compensation of our Practice Leaders and client-facing managing directors consists of restricted stock that vests over four years and is awarded based on prior year performance. We believe the amount of equity provided below the NEO level aligns the interests of our individual practices with the Company as a whole and significantly differentiates Huron's compensation program from the programs of our competitors. Our ability to offer equity as a long-term component of compensation also helps us recruit talent that is critical for Huron's continued growth. We believe that our ability to offer long-term equity incentives encourages a balanced focus on short-term goals, long-term goals and performance that cannot be as effectively achieved with cash awards alone.  Approval Required 
The approval of the amendment to the Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total shares of common stock present in person, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on the proposal, provided that a quorum is represented at the meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be considered shares entitled to vote with respect to approval of the proposal and will not be counted as votes for or against the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Executed proxies will be voted "FOR" the approval of the proposal, unless specified otherwise. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED 2012 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN. 
Description of the Plan 
The summary of the material features of the Plan set forth below is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Plan attached as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement in connection with the Company's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on March 27, 2017. A copy of the amendment to the Plan is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. 
There are several types of awards that may be granted under the Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock options (including both incentive stock options ("ISOs"), within the meaning of Section 422 of the  Code and nonqualified options ("NQSOs"), which are options that do not qualify as ISOs);  
• SARs;  
• full value awards, which means a grant of one or more shares of common stock or a right to receive one or more shares  of common stock, subject to one or more of the conditions, restrictions and contingencies determined at the time of the award; and  
• cash incentive awards.  
[END TABLE]
If this proposal is approved by stockholders, there would be approximately 1,051,971 shares available for issuance under the Plan as of May 3, 2019.8 
Shares subject to an award under the Plan that remain unissued upon the cancellation, surrender, exchange, forfeiture or termination of the award without having been exercised or settled will again become available for award under the Plan. In addition, to the extent an award under the Plan is paid or settled in cash, the number of shares of common stock with respect to which such payment or settlement is made shall again be available for grants of awards pursuant to the Plan. Any shares subject to an award under the Plan that are retained by us as payment of the exercise price of an option or to satisfy (A) all tax withholding obligations with respect to a stock option or stock appreciation right, or (B) tax withholding obligations in excess of the minimum required withholding amount with respect to a full value award, and any shares purchased by us using stock option exercise proceeds, will not again be made available for future grants under the Plan. Further, for stock-settled stock appreciation rights (to the extent they are utilized in the future), the shares subject to the award shall be counted against the plan reserve, regardless of the number of shares issued. 
The Plan does not permit dividend payments on stock options and SARs, and requires dividends and dividend equivalents (if any) on unvested awards to be held until the underlying award is vested. The Plan adds a minimum one-year vesting requirement to all equity awards with a limited carve out of 5% of the total pool to allow for exceptions, as necessary. In addition, the Plan limits the ability of shares withheld for taxes or exercise price of an award to be returned to the Plan to be made available for future grants. The Plan provides a limit on awards to non-employee directors for any calendar year (along with cash retainer and meeting fees). 
In addition, if a corporation acquired by (or combined with) Huron or any subsidiary has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for awards under the Plan and will not reduce 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8  May 3, 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
  the shares authorized for grant under the Plan. Any such awards may not, however, be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and may only be made to individuals who were not employees or directors of Huron or any subsidiary prior to such acquisition or combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such shares may not increase the number of shares available for awards of incentive stock options unless such additional share limit is approved by the shareholders in accordance with Section 422 of the Code. 
The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. Our executive officers and Huron's other officers, employees numbering approximately 3,200 in total, and outside directors as of March 1, 2019, will be eligible to receive awards under the Plan at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the authority to administer the Plan and to exercise all of the powers and authorities specifically granted to it under the Plan as necessary or advisable in the administration of the Plan, including the authority to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• grant awards;  
• determine the individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, awards will be granted;  
• determine the type and number of awards to be granted, the number of shares of common stock or cash or other property  to which an award may relate and the terms, conditions, restrictions and performance criteria relating to any award;  
• determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances an award may be settled, cancelled, forfeited, exchanged  or surrendered;  
• conclusively interpret the Plan and all awards;  
• prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan;  
• determine the terms and provisions of any award agreements; and  
• make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the operation and administration of the Plan.   
[END TABLE]
Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Compensation Committee may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerate the date on which any ISO, NQSO or SAR becomes exercisable;  
• waive or amend the operation of the Plan provisions respecting exercise of an option or a SAR after termination of  employment to a period no longer than 10 years from the date of grant of the award;  
• accelerate the vesting date, or waive any condition imposed by the Plan, with respect to any full value award; and   
• otherwise adjust any of the terms applicable to any award in a manner consistent with the terms of the Plan.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may delegate some of its authority under the Plan to one or more of our officers, to act on behalf of the Compensation Committee with respect to any matter that is the responsibility of the Compensation Committee, as described above, and to approve awards for certain other employees. 
Our board of directors may suspend or terminate the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect, subject to stockholder approval where required to satisfy legal or applicable stock exchange requirements. No amendment may be made without the approval of our stockholders if such amendment would: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• materially increase the benefits accruing to a participant under the Plan;  
• increase the aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the Plan;  
• modify the requirements as to eligibility to participate in the Plan; or  
• result in the repricing or buy-back of options where the exercise price of the  option is greater than the then current fair market value of a share of common stock (that is, if it is "underwater").  
[END TABLE]
The Plan will terminate no later than May 1, 2027. Awards granted before the termination of the Plan may extend beyond that date in accordance with their terms. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant awards to persons who are foreign nationals on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may be necessary or desirable to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan, subject in any specific case to   applicable requirements, such as stockholder approval. Specifically, the Compensation Committee may make such modifications, amendments, procedures and subplans as may be necessary or advisable to comply with provisions of laws in other countries or jurisdictions in which Huron operates or has employees. 
Except for adjustments pursuant to the Plan or reductions of the exercise price approved by stockholders, the exercise price of any outstanding option or SAR may not be decreased after the date of grant, nor may an outstanding option or SAR granted under the Plan be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a replacement option or SAR with a lower exercise price. Except as approved by the Company's stockholders, in no event may any option or SAR be surrendered to the Company in consideration for a cash payment if, at the time of the surrender, the option or SAR is underwater. Finally, no repricing of an option may be made without the approval of the Company's stockholders if approval is required under the rules of any stock exchange on which the Company's common stock is listed. 
Vesting terms of any award will be specified at the time an award is made, although vesting of an award will be accelerated if a participant's employment is terminated by Huron or its successor for reasons other than cause within 12 months of a change of control or if the Plan is terminated within 12 months of a change of control without provision for the continuation of outstanding awards. In addition, if a participant is terminated for cause, all of that person's outstanding unexercised awards will expire on the date prior to the termination. Except for awards that do not exceed 5% of the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, in no event will the required period of service for full vesting be less than one year (subject, to the extent provided by the Compensation Committee, to acceleration of vesting in the event of a participant's death, disability, or change of control). 
Under the Plan, the maximum number of shares of stock that may be granted to any participant during any calendar year period with respect to full value awards that are intended to be performance-based compensation shall not exceed 500,000 shares in the aggregate (subject to equitable adjustment as provided). The maximum number of shares of stock to which ISOs relate that may be granted to any participant under the Plan is 325,000 (subject to equitable adjustment as provided). In addition, the maximum amount payable to any person for any 12-month performance period with respect to a cash incentive award that is intended to be performance-based compensation, which we discuss in further detail in the next subsection, is $10,000,000. Finally, for any participant who is an outside director, the aggregate grant date fair value of awards granted to such individual during any calendar year, along with any regular cash retainer or meeting fees paid to such participant during such calendar year, will not exceed $1,500,000. 
Performance Criteria 
The exercisability or payment of awards may be based upon one or more of the following business criteria as established by the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• return on total stockholder equity;  
• earnings or book value per share of Company common stock ("EPS");  
• adjusted EPS;  
• net income (before or after taxes);  
• earnings before all or any interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization ("EBIT," "EBITA" or  "EBITDA") measured as a dollar amount or a percentage of revenue;  
• adjusted EBITDA measured as a dollar amount or a percentage of revenue;  
• return on assets, capital or investment;  
• market share;  
• market capitalization;  
• cost reduction goals;  
• levels of expense, costs or liabilities;  
• department, division or business unit level performance;  
• operating income;  
• sales or revenues;  
• stock price appreciation;  
• total stockholder return (TSR);  
• implementation or completion of critical projects or processes;  
• days sales outstanding (DSO);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• financial coverage ratios;  
• other non-GAAP financial measures; and  
• any combination of the foregoing.  
[END TABLE]
These business criteria may be applied to results including or excluding discontinued operations, expressed in terms of attaining a specified level of the particular criteria or the attainment of a percentage increase or decrease in the particular criteria, and may be applied to one or more of the Company, an affiliate of the Company, or a department, division or strategic business unit of the Company and/or one or more affiliates of the Company. The business criteria also may be applied to the performance of the Company and/or one or more affiliates of the Company relative to a market index, a group of other companies or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The business criteria may be subject to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a threshold level of performance below which no payment will be made (or no vesting will occur);  
• levels of performance at which specified payments will be made (or specified vesting will occur); and   
• a maximum level of performance above which no additional payment will be made (or at which full vesting will occur).   
[END TABLE]
Each of the business criteria will be determined, where applicable, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and will be subject to certification by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the authority to make equitable adjustments to the business criteria in recognition of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• special, unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or any of its  affiliates or the financial statements of the Company or any of its affiliates;  
• changes in applicable laws or regulations;  
• gains, losses or expenses determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to  the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principles;  
• asset write-downs;  
• litigation, claim judgments, settlements or restatement related expenses;  
• accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs;  
• acquisitions or divestitures (including expenses related thereto);  
• foreign exchange gains and losses;  
• non-cash interest; and  
• an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within reasonable control of the  Company's management.  
[END TABLE]
Tax Consequences 
The following provides only a general description of the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to certain awards under the Plan. This discussion is intended for the information of our stockholders considering how to vote at the Annual Meeting and not as tax guidance to participants in the Plan, as the consequences may vary with the types of awards made, the identity of the recipients and the method of payment or settlement. Different tax rules may apply, including in the case of variations in transactions that are permitted under the Plan (such as payment of the exercise price of an option by surrender of previously acquired shares of common stock). This summary does not address in any detail the effects of other federal taxes (including possible "golden parachute" excise taxes) or taxes imposed under state, local or foreign tax laws. 
We generally will be entitled to withhold any required taxes in connection with the exercise or payment of any award, and may require the participant to pay such taxes as a condition to the exercise or payment of an award. ISOs may only be granted to our employees and employees of certain of our subsidiaries. 
Stock Options. ISOs and NQSOs are treated differently for federal income tax purposes. ISOs are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. NQSOs need not satisfy such requirements. 
Generally, a participant is not taxed on the grant of an ISO and is not taxed on the exercise of an ISO, except as described in the next sentence and provided that the participant has been an employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code rules) from the date the ISO was granted until three months before the date of exercise. The difference between the exercise price and the fair market   value of the shares on the exercise date, however, will be a preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, and thus a participant could be subject to the alternative minimum tax as a result of the exercise of an ISO. If a participant holds the shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO for at least two years following the ISO grant date and at least one year following exercise, the participant recognizes capital gain (or loss, as applicable), if any, upon a subsequent disposition of such shares. The measure of the gain is the difference between the proceeds received on disposition and the participant's basis in the shares (which generally equals the exercise price). 
If a participant disposes of shares acquired pursuant to exercise of an ISO before satisfying the one-year and two-year holding periods described above, then: (i) if the proceeds received exceed the exercise price of the ISO, the participant will recognize long-term or short-term capital gain (as applicable) equal to the excess, if any, of the proceeds received over the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, and will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, if any, of the lesser of the proceeds received or the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of an ISO; or (ii) if the proceeds received are less than the exercise price of the ISO, the participant will recognize a capital loss equal to the excess of the exercise price of the ISO over the proceeds received. 
We are not entitled to an income tax deduction on the grant or exercise of an ISO or on the participant's disposition of the shares after satisfying the holding period requirements described above. If the holding periods are not satisfied, we will be entitled to a deduction (subject to the limit under Section 162(m) of the Code discussed below) in the year the participant disposes of the shares in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
A recipient generally will not realize any taxable income upon the grant of an NQSO. Upon exercise of an NQSO, the participant will realize ordinary income in an amount generally measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the stock option exercise price. We will generally be entitled to a deduction (subject to the limit under Section 162(m) of the Code) in the same amount as the ordinary income realized by the participant. Upon the sale of shares acquired upon exercise of an NQSO, the participant will realize short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, depending upon the length of time the shares are held. Such gain or loss will be measured by the difference between the sale price of the shares and the fair market value on the date of exercise. 
SARs. A participant generally will not realize any taxable income upon the grant of a SAR. Upon the exercise of such right, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the amount of cash and/or the fair market value, at the date of such exercise, of the shares received by the participant as a result of such exercise. We will generally be entitled to a deduction (subject to the limit under Section 162(m) of the Code) in the same amount as the ordinary income realized by the participant. 
Full Value Awards. If a restriction on transferability and substantial risk of forfeiture applies to shares of common stock or other property actually distributed to a participant under an award (such as, for example, a grant of restricted stock), the participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the transferred amounts at the earliest time either the transferability restriction or risk of forfeiture lapses. In the usual case, we can claim a tax deduction (subject to the limit under Section 162(m) of the Code) in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, except as discussed below. A participant may elect to be taxed at the time of grant of restricted stock or other property rather than upon lapse of restrictions on transferability or the risk of forfeiture, but if the participant subsequently forfeits such shares of common stock or property he or she would not be entitled to any tax deduction, including as a capital loss, for the value of shares of common stock on which he or she previously paid tax. 
If no substantial risk of forfeiture applies to property distributed to a participant, the participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of shares of common stock actually received. 
If an award does not consist of property (such as stock units), the participant generally must recognize ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes when the award is paid in an amount equal to the amount payable or, if the award is settled in shares of common stock, the fair market value on the date of distribution, and we would normally be entitled to a corresponding deduction (subject to the limit under Section 162(m) of the Code).  In general, under Section 162(m) of the Code, income tax deductions of publicly held corporations may be limited to the extent total compensation (including base salary, annual bonus, stock option exercises and nonqualified benefits) for certain executive officers exceeds $1.0 million (less the amount of any "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in any taxable year of the corporation. The exception for qualified "performance-based" compensation was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a result, any new equity awards under the Plan will be subject to the $1 million deduction limitation. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the term "covered employee" now includes any individual who served as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers for the taxable year. Once an individual becomes a covered employee, that individual will remain a covered employee for all future years, including after termination or death.  PROPOSAL 3 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the SEC, Huron annually is asking its stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation, which includes the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosures, all as described in the section entitled "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION— Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The vote solicited by this proposal, commonly known as "Say on Pay," is advisory in nature and will not be binding on the board of directors, the Compensation Committee or Huron. However, the board of directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders, will review the voting results and, to the extent determined appropriate, take into account the outcome of the vote during future deliberations on executive compensation arrangements. 
Huron believes that its executive compensation program is structured to support Huron and its business objectives. This vote is not intended to address any one specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total shares of common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal, is required to approve the advisory vote on the compensation arrangements of our named executive officers. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be considered shares entitled to vote with respect to the proposal and will not be counted as votes for or against the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Proxies submitted pursuant to this solicitation will be voted "FOR" the approval of the advisory vote on the compensation arrangements of our named executive officers, unless specified otherwise. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SECTION AND THE ACCOMPANYING COMPENSATION TABLES AND NARRATIVE DISCUSSION IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.  PROPOSAL 4 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), which has been the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company since its inception, has been appointed by the Audit Committee as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. This appointment is being presented to the stockholders for ratification. The ratification of the appointment of PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal, provided that a quorum is represented at the meeting. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against ratification. Broker non-votes will not be considered shares entitled to vote with respect to ratification of the appointment and will not be counted as votes for or against the ratification and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Proxies submitted pursuant to this solicitation will be voted "FOR" the ratification of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, unless specified otherwise. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be provided an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate inquiries from stockholders. 
AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by PwC for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and fees for other services rendered by PwC during those periods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 1,411               $ 1,686    
 Audit-Related Fees    $ 44               $ 53    
 Tax Fees    $ 140               $ 35    
 All Other Fees    $ 3               $ 3    
 Total    $     1,598               $     1,777    
[END TABLE]
For fiscal year 2018, 100% of All Other Fees were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the de minimis exception to the preapproval requirements under 17 CFR 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C). These fees include $545 paid for a real estate survey provided by PwC. 
Audit Fees—all services, including tax services and accounting consultation, necessary to perform an audit of the consolidated financial statements of Huron; services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, comfort letters, statutory audits, attest services and consents; and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. 
Audit-Related Fees—consultation and procedures performed concerning new financial accounting and reporting standards and attest services that are not required by statute or regulations. 
Tax Fees—tax compliance (review of original and amended tax returns, claims for refund and tax payment-planning services); tax planning; and other tax advice (assistance with tax audits and appeals, tax advice related to structural matters, and requests for rulings or technical advice from taxing authorities). 
All Other Fees—any other work that is not audit, audit-related or a tax service.  The Audit Committee considers whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and has determined such services for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were compatible. 
POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PREAPPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding preapproval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee, on a periodic basis, determines certain services that have the general preapproval of the Committee. The Audit Committee must separately preapprove any services not receiving such general preapproval. Requests for such approval must be submitted by both the independent registered public accounting firm and the CFO and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. Except for those non-audit services discussed above, in 2018 no services were undertaken that were not preapproved. The Audit Committee will establish preapproved fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. On a periodic basis, the CFO and the independent registered public accounting firm report to the Audit Committee regarding the actual spending for such projects and services compared to the approved amounts. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the board of directors in its general oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee conducted its oversight activities for Huron Consulting Group Inc. and subsidiaries ("Huron") in accordance with the duties and responsibilities outlined in the Audit Committee charter. 
Huron's management is responsible for the preparation, consistency, integrity and fair presentation of the financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, systems of internal control and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. Huron's independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, is responsible for performing an independent audit of Huron's financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee, with the assistance and support of the Huron finance department and management of Huron, has fulfilled its objectives, duties and responsibilities as stipulated in the Audit Committee charter and has provided adequate and appropriate independent oversight and monitoring of Huron's systems of internal control for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
These activities included, but were not limited to, the following for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discussed with Huron's internal auditors their continuing work in support of examination of internal controls and  financial compliance controls.  
• Reviewed and discussed with management and PwC the audited financial statements and the quarterly financial statements  for the year ended December 31, 2018. Management has the primary responsibility for such financial statements.  
• Discussed with PwC the matters requiring discussion under current auditing standards.  
• Received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence.  
[END TABLE]
In reliance on the Committee's review and discussions of the matters referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in Huron's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

John McCartney 
John S. Moody  SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
In order to be included in the Company's proxy statement relating to its next annual meeting, stockholder proposals must be received no later than November 23, 2019 by the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices. Pursuant to the Company's bylaws, stockholders who intend to present an item for business at the next annual meeting (other than a proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials) must provide notice to the Corporate Secretary no earlier than January 4, 2020 and no later than February 3, 2020. Notice of stockholder proposals must contain the information required by the Company's bylaws. The inclusion of any such proposal in such proxy material shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the 1934 Act. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Management does not now intend to bring before the Annual Meeting any matters other than those disclosed in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and it does not know of any business that persons, other than management, intend to present at the meeting. Should any other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders arise, the proxies in the enclosed form confer discretionary authority on the board of directors to vote on any other matter proposed by stockholders in accordance with their best judgment. 
The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. The Company has retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to provide general advice and potential assistance in the solicitation process for a fee of approximately $50,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
