    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING         
      When and Where Is the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Being Held?         
        The 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Arch Coal, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Arch" or the "Company"), will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019. The Annual Meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m., Central time, in the lower level auditorium at the Company's headquarters located at CityPlace One, One CityPlace Drive, St. Louis, Missouri 63141. 
      Who May Vote at the Annual Meeting?         
        Stockholders of the Company on March 7, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting. On the record date, the Company had 17,419,096 shares of Common Stock outstanding, consisting of 17,418,839 shares of Class A Common Stock and 257 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. 
      How Do I Gain Admission to the Annual Meeting?         
        If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, you must be a stockholder on the record date, register to attend the Annual Meeting, and request an admission ticket on or before April 25, 2019. Each stockholder planning to attend the Annual Meeting will be asked to present an admission ticket and a valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. You may request an admission ticket by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions provided or by calling 1-844-318-0137.

        Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order in which they are received. Please note that seating is limited and will be on a first-come, first-served basis. 
        No cameras, camcorders, videotaping equipment, other recording devices, bags or large packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting.

      What Items Will Be Voted on at the Annual Meeting?         
        Stockholders will vote on the following items at the Annual Meeting: Table of Contents
      What Are the Board's Voting Recommendations?         
        The Board recommends you vote your shares:
      How Do I Vote?         
        If you are a registered stockholder, you may vote your shares in advance using any of the following voting alternatives: 
        By Internet —  You can vote over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the instructions provided (you will need the Control Number from the Notice or proxy card you receive). 
         By Phone —  You can vote by phone by calling the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card or voting instruction card (you will need the Control Number from the Notice or proxy card you receive). 
        By Mail —  If you received your proxy materials by mail, you can vote by signing, dating and returning the accompanying proxy card. 
        Alternatively, you may vote your shares in person at the meeting. 
        When your proxy is properly submitted, your shares will be voted as you indicate. If you do not indicate your voting preference, the appointed proxies (John W. Eaves and Robert G. Jones) will vote your shares FOR each of the director nominees to the Board under Proposal No. 1, FOR Proposal No. 2 and FOR Proposal No. 3. If your shares are owned in joint names, all joint owners must vote by the same method, and if joint owners vote by mail, all of the joint owners must sign the proxy card. The deadline for voting by telephone or via the Internet, is 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day before the Annual Meeting. 
        If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, follow the instructions provided by your nominee to vote your shares. In most instances, you will be able to vote by the same methods as indicated above. You must have a legal proxy from the stockholder of record in order to vote the shares in person at the Annual Meeting. 
      May I Change My Vote?         
        You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the voting deadline for the Annual Meeting. After your initial vote, you may vote again on a later date any time prior to the Annual Meeting via the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the voting deadline for the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual  Table of Contents
Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked. 
      How Many Votes Do I Have?         
        You have one vote for each share of the Company's Class A Common Stock and one vote for each share of the Company's Class B Common Stock that you owned at the close of business on the record date. These shares include:
      Is My Vote Confidential?         
        Yes. Voting tabulations are confidential except in extremely limited circumstances. Such limited circumstances include contested solicitation of proxies when disclosure is required by law to defend a claim against the Company or to assert a claim by the Company and when a stockholder's written comments appear in a proxy or other voting material. 
      What Are Broker Non-Votes and How Are They Counted?         
        A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank, or other nominee holding shares on behalf of a beneficial owner is prohibited from exercising discretionary voting authority for a beneficial owner who has not provided voting instructions. Brokers, banks, and other nominees may vote without instruction only on "routine" proposals. On "non-routine" proposals, nominees cannot vote without instructions from the beneficial owner, resulting in so-called "broker non-votes." Proposal No. 3, the ratification of Ernst & Young, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, is the only routine proposal on the ballot for the Annual Meeting. All other proposals are non-routine. If you hold your shares with a broker, bank, or other nominee, they will not be voted on non-routine proposals unless you give voting instructions to such nominee. Broker non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum at the meeting, but are not counted for purposes of determining the number of shares present and entitled to vote on non-routine matters. 
      What Is the Voting Requirement to Approve Each of the Proposals?         
        For Proposal No. 1, the eight nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them will be elected as directors to serve for one-year terms and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Abstentions are not counted for the purpose of the election of directors, and neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will have any effect on the voting results. 
        Approval of Proposals No. 2 and No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting. The vote on Proposal No. 2, the approval of the Company's named executive officer compensation, is a non-binding advisory vote only.  Table of Contents
        Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast. Accordingly, neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will affect the outcome of the voting on Proposals No. 2 and No. 3. 
        If a submitted proxy does not specify how to vote, the shares represented by that proxy will be considered to be voted FOR each of the eight nominees recommended by the Board in Proposal No. 1, and FOR each of Proposals No. 2 and No. 3. Unless a stockholder checks the box on the proxy card or provides instructions to withhold discretionary voting authority, the appointed proxies may use their discretion to vote on any other matters properly brought before the meeting. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Company knows of no other matter that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than those matters discussed in this proxy statement. 
      What "Quorum" Is Required for the Annual Meeting?         
        In order to have a valid stockholder vote, a quorum must exist at the Annual Meeting. For the Company, a quorum exists when stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are present or represented at a meeting. For these purposes, shares that are present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting will be counted toward a quorum, regardless of whether the holder of the shares or proxy fails to vote on a particular matter or whether a broker with discretionary voting authority fails to exercise such authority with respect to any particular matter. 
      What Is Householding?         
        As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Company may deliver only one copy of this proxy statement and its 2018 annual report to stockholders residing at the same address, unless the stockholders have notified the Company of their desire to receive multiple copies of these documents. This is known as householding. 
        The Company will promptly deliver, upon request, a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report to any stockholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed. Requests for separate copies for the current year or future years, or to receive a single copy in the future for stockholders sharing an address, should be directed to the Secretary, Arch Coal, Inc. One CityPlace Drive., Suite 300, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, or by telephone at (314) 994-2700. 
      Where Can I Find the Voting Results?         
        The Company intends to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. The Company will publish the final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company expects to file within four business days after the Annual Meeting is held. You can obtain a copy of the Current Report on Form 8-K by logging on to the Company's website at archcoal.com or through the EDGAR system at sec.gov.

    DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES         
      Overview         
        Arch is dedicated to being a global leader in the coal industry and to creating long-term value for the Company's stockholders. It is the Company's policy to conduct the Company's business with integrity and an unrelenting passion for providing the best value to the Company's customers. The Company's key corporate governance materials, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Board committee charters, are published under the "Investors" section of the Company's website at archcoal.com. Information on the Company's website does not constitute part of this proxy statement. The Board regularly reviews these materials and modifies them as warranted based upon Delaware law, the rules and listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC regulations, as well as best practices recommended by recognized governance authorities. 
      Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct         
     Corporate Governance Guidelines       
        The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth a framework within which the Board, assisted by its committees, directs the affairs of the Company. These Guidelines address, among other items, the composition and functions of the Board, director independence, compensation of directors, and director qualification standards. 
    Code of Conduct       
        The Company's Code of Business Conduct is applicable to all employees of the Company, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, as well as all directors of the Company. 
        The  Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Code of Business Conduct are available on the Company's website under the "Investors" section at archcoal.com and in print to any stockholder who requests them from the Company's Secretary. The Company intends to post amendments to or waivers from (to the extent applicable to one of the Company's directors or executive officers) the Code of Business Conduct at the same location on the Company's website. Information on the Company's website does not constitute part of this proxy statement. 
      Our Commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship         
        Safety and environmental stewardship are core values at Arch Coal. Our commitment to the safety of our employees and to the environmental care of our planet are an essential and ongoing part of our business. We strive for the ultimate goal of zero safety incidents, and we deploy a variety of safety programs to help us continuously improve. We are proud of our award-winning reclamation and strong environmental compliance. 
        Our Board provides oversight and regularly reviews the company's safety and environmental performance. Our executive leadership team actively manages the Company's performance and strives to ensure these core values are ingrained in the Company's culture. We believe that our performance in the areas of safety and environmental compliance is integral to our operational and financial performance and to enhancing long-term  Table of Contents stockholder value. Additional information regarding these core values and our long-standing commitment to sustainability is available on the Company's website at archcoal.com. 
      Director Independence         
        It is the Board's objective to have a substantial number of directors who are independent. The Corporate Governance Guidelines incorporate the criteria established by the New York Stock Exchange to assist the Board in determining whether a director is independent. The Board has determined, in its judgment, that all but one member, John W. Eaves, meet the New York Stock Exchange standards for independence. 
        All members of the Company's Audit, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Personnel and Compensation Committees must be independent directors in accordance with the Company's  Corporate Governance Guidelines. Members of the Audit Committee must also satisfy a separate SEC independence requirement, which provides that they may not accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries other than their directors' compensation. 
      Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight         
        Mr. James N. Chapman has served as the chairman of the Company's Board since October 2016. The Board has no fixed policy with respect to the separation of the offices of chairman and chief executive officer. Instead, the Board retains the discretion to make this determination on a case-by-case basis from time to time as it deems to be in the best interest of the Company and the Company's stockholders. The Company's current structure is that Mr. Chapman serves as chairman of the Board, and Mr. Eaves serves as chief executive officer of the Company. 
        Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company's non-management directors meet regularly in executive session without management present. The chairman of the Board presides over these executive sessions. However, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, if the chairman of the Board is the chief executive officer, or is not an independent director, the independent directors of the Board shall elect a lead director to lead executive session meetings of the independent members of the Board. 
        Our full Board is responsible for oversight of the Company's risk management processes. In fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities, the Board receives periodic reports on management's enterprise risk assessment process and assessment of current and future risks. To increase the Board's effectiveness, the standing committees of the Board are actively involved in risk oversight. The committees' involvement also allows for a deeper review of specific risks. Each committee reports on its activities to the full Board. 
      Director Qualifications, Diversity and Biographies         
        The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board will consider candidates for the Company's Board who possess the following principal qualities: strength of character, an inquiring and independent mind, practical wisdom, and mature judgment. In addition to these qualities, the selection criteria for nomination include recognized achievement, an ability to contribute to some aspect of the Company's business, and the willingness to make the commitment of time and effort required of a director.  Table of Contents
        As described in more detail below, the Company's Board believes that each of the Company's directors meets such criteria and has attributes and experience that make him well qualified to serve. In order to find the most valuable talent available to meet these criteria, the Company's Board generally considers candidates diverse in geographic origin, gender, ethnic background, and professional experience (private, public, and non-profit), pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Company's goal is to include members with the skills and characteristics that, taken together, will assure a strong Board. 
        The Company's directors have diverse backgrounds and provide experience and expertise in a number of critical areas. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the particular experience, attributes, reputation and qualifications of directors standing for re-election and potential nominees for election, as well as the needs of the Company's Board as a whole and its standing committees. 
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has identified nine areas of expertise that are particularly relevant to service on the Board and has identified the directors whose key areas of expertise qualify them for each of the listed categories. The categories identified by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are: Table of Contents

Mr. Hamill was recommended to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as a director candidate by a stockholder, and Ms. Koeppel was recommended to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as a director candidate by a third-party search firm engaged by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to assist in identifying potential director candidates.

        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, the following items:
        The Board has determined, in its judgment, that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is published under the "Investors" section of the Company's website at archcoal.com. 
    Personnel and Compensation Committee       
        The Personnel and Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, the following items:
        The Board has determined, in its judgment, that the Personnel and Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. In making its determination, the Board considered, among other things, the factors applicable to members of the Personnel and Compensation Committee pursuant to New York Stock Exchange listing standards and Rule 10C-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Personnel and Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the entire Board, a copy of which is published under the "Investors" section of the Company's website at archcoal.com. The report of the Personnel and Compensation Committee can be found under "Personnel and Compensation Committee Report" in this proxy statement. 
    Audit Committee       
        The Audit Committee is responsible for the following items: Table of Contents
        The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board has determined, in its judgment, that the Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent directors in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is published under the "Investors" section of the Company's website at archcoal.com. 
        The Board has determined, in its judgment, that each of the three members of the Audit Committee is "financially literate" and is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in SEC regulations. Under the Audit Committee's charter, no member of the committee may serve on more than two other public company audit committees unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service will not impair the ability of the member to serve effectively on the committee. None of the members of the Audit Committee currently serve on the audit committees of more than two other public companies. The report of the Audit Committee can be found under "Audit Committee Report" in this proxy statement. 
      Board and Committee Self-Assessments         
        The Board conducts annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively and whether its governing documents continue to remain appropriate. Each committee also annually reviews its own performance and assesses the adequacy of its charter and reports the results and any recommendations to the Board. 
      Director Retirement/Resignation Policies         
        The Corporate Governance Guidelines require any nominee for director in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election to offer his or her resignation to the Board. In the event a resignation is tendered, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board will evaluate the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and make a determination on the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation, which may include (i) accepting the resignation, (ii) maintaining the director but addressing the underlying cause of the withheld votes, (iii) resolving that the director will not be re-nominated in the future for election, or (iv) rejecting the resignation. Following a determination by the Board, the Company will disclose the Board's decision in a filing with the SEC, a press release, or another broadly disseminated means of communication. The Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to nominate for election or re-election only those candidates who agree in advance in writing to tender a resignation letter in accordance with these terms. Each nominee for election at the Annual Meeting has agreed to follow this policy as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
        The Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that outside directors tender their resignation for consideration by the Board following such director's 72nd birthday. 
        Vacancies on the Board may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy, or a new directorship created by an increase in the size of the Board, serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, incapacitation or removal from office, and except as otherwise required by law.  Table of Contents
      Conflicts of Interest         
        The Company's Code of Business Conduct reflects the Company's policy that all of the Company's employees, including the Company's named executive officers and directors must avoid any activity that creates, or may create, a conflict of interest that might interfere with the proper performance of their duties or that might be hostile, adverse or competitive with the Company's business. In addition, each of the Company's directors and executive officers is encouraged to notify the Company's Board when confronted with any situation that may be perceived as a conflict of interest, even if the person does not believe that the situation would violate the Company's  Code of Business Conduct or Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board will then determine, after consultation with counsel, whether a conflict of interest exists. Directors who have a material personal interest in a particular issue may not vote on any matters with respect to that issue. 
      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation         
        James N. Chapman, Patrick J. Bartels, Jr. and Scott D. Vogel each served on the Personnel and Compensation Committee during 2018. None of the directors who served on the Personnel and Compensation Committee during 2018 has been an officer or employee of the Company. None of the Company's executive officers has served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Company's Board or Personnel and Compensation Committee. See "Transactions with Related Persons" below for certain transactions involving Mr. Bartels. 
      Nomination Process for Election of Directors         
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for assessing the need for new directors to address specific requirements or to fill a vacancy. All candidates must meet the requirements specified in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Candidates who meet those requirements and otherwise qualify for membership on the Company's Board are identified, and the committee initiates contact with preferred candidates. The committee regularly reports to the Board on the progress of the committee's efforts. The committee meets to consider and approve final candidates who are then presented to the Board for consideration and approval. The Company's chairman or the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may extend an invitation to join the Board. 
        Stockholder recommendations must be submitted in writing to Robert G. Jones, the Company's Secretary, and must include information regarding nominees required under the Company's Bylaws. Individuals properly recommended by stockholders will receive the same consideration received by individuals identified to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through other means. 
        The Company's Bylaws include a proxy access provision that allows stockholders who meet the requirements set forth in the Bylaws to include a specified number of director nominees in the Company's proxy materials. 
      Communicating with the Board of Directors         
        The Company's Board has established procedures intended to facilitate communication by stockholders and interested parties directly with the Board as a whole, any of the Company's Board committees, the chairman of the Board, and any other individual director or group of directors, including the Company's non-employee directors as a whole. Such communications may be confidential or anonymous, and may be reported by phone to  Table of Contents the Company's confidential hotline at 866-519-1881 or by writing to the individual directors or group in care of Arch Coal, Inc., One CityPlace Drive, Suite 300, St. Louis, Missouri 63141, Attention: Senior Vice President-Law, General Counsel and Secretary.

    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS   (PROPOSAL NO. 1)

Edmiston III, Robert B. Hamill, Holly Keller Koeppel, Patrick A. Kriegshauser and Richard A. Navarre for election as directors, each to serve for a term that will expire at the Company's 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, until a successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. 
        To the knowledge of the Board, no nominee will be unwilling or unable to serve as a director. All nominees have consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. If, however, a nominee is unavailable for election, your proxy authorizes the Company to vote for a replacement nominee if the Board names one. As an alternative, the Board may reduce the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting. 
Recommendation of the Board  
        The Board recommends a vote "FOR" each nominee.   Table of Contents
       ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION   (PROPOSAL NO. 2)         
        Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are seeking advisory stockholder approval of the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs"), or "say-on-pay" vote, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement entitled "Executive Compensation." Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following advisory resolution: 
        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Arch Coal, Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material)."
        The compensation of our NEOs is designed to tie a substantial percentage of each officer's compensation opportunity to the attainment of financial and other performance measures that the Board believes promote the creation of long-term stockholder value and position the Company for long-term success. As described more fully in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), the total mix of compensation that the Company offers its NEOs is designed to enable the Company to attract and maintain top talent while, at the same time, creating a close relationship between performance and compensation. The Personnel and Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the design of the program, and as a result, the compensation awarded to NEOs under the program, fulfills this objective. 
        Stockholders are urged to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement, the compensation tables and accompanying narratives, which discuss in detail how our compensation policies and procedures implement our compensation philosophy. 
        Although the vote on this Proposal No. 2 is non-binding, the Board will review the voting results in connection with its ongoing evaluation of the Company's compensation program. The final decision on the compensation and benefits of our NEOs remains with the Board. The Board has adopted a policy that provides for this vote annually. At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders voted, on an advisory basis, to hold annual "say-on-pay" votes. 
Recommendation of the Board  
        The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:  
        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Arch Coal, Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material)."

    RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF   INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   (PROPOSAL NO. 3)         
        Ernst & Young LLP was the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. The Audit Committee and the Board are requesting that stockholders ratify this appointment. In the event the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if the Audit Committee believes such a change would be in the Company's best interests and the best interests of the Company's stockholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be available at the Annual Meeting to make a statement if they desire to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
      Fees Paid to Auditors         
        The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

 All Other Fees     —     —   
[END TABLE]
        The Audit Committee has adopted an audit and non-audit services pre-approval policy that requires the Audit Committee to pre-approve services to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee will consider whether the services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm are prohibited by the SEC's rules on auditor independence and whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service. The Audit Committee is mindful of the relationship between fees for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve such services. The Audit Committee has delegated to the chairman of the Audit Committee pre-approval authority between committee meetings, and the chairman must report any pre-approval decisions to the committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting. All non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young LLP in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved in accordance with the procedures established by the Audit Committee. 
      Recommendation of the Board         
        The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Table of Contents 
 OTHER MATTERS  
        The Company knows of no other matters to be submitted to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the stockholders at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named on the proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         
        Our compensation program for 2018 was focused on incentivizing our NEOs to create long-term value for our stockholders and other stakeholders. We accomplished the following goals in 2018: Table of Contents
   2018 Key Compensation Decisions and Actions  
        Our key compensation decisions and actions relating to our NEOs' compensation for 2018 included the following:  Table of Contents
   Overview  
        Our compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain highly talented executives, while keeping them focused on promoting our strategic objectives. We believe these compensation programs encourage sustained long-term profitability by making a significant portion of each named executive officer's total direct compensation variable and dependent on our achievement of safety, environmental and financial performance. Thus, most of our executives' total compensation is performance-based and not guaranteed. 
        The type and amount of compensation for each NEO is determined after considering a variety of factors, including the executive's position and level of responsibility within our organization, comparative market data and other external market-based factors. The Personnel and Compensation Committee, or the Committee, uses this information when establishing compensation in order to achieve a comprehensive package that emphasizes pay-for-performance and is competitive in the marketplace. For the 2018 fiscal year, the pay mix at target for the CEO and other NEOs is displayed below.  Table of Contents
        The components of the NEO compensation program for 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Incentive Compensation Program     Performance-based cash compensation opportunity tied to annual goals of Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and safety and environmental measures             Financial metrics focus NEOs on achieving key annual financial goals and objectives based on budgeted expectations for the year.    Safety and environmental measures focus   NEOs on these important areas of performance. 
 Benefits     Standard range of medical, dental, life insurance, disability and retirement plans available to other employees, as well as executive benefits described below under "Other Benefits"             Provide market-competitive level of support in the event of injury, illness and retirement.    Limited executive benefits are provided to address unique situations or   expectations for our executives. 
[END TABLE]
   Our Compensation Process  
        The Committee, with advice and analysis from its independent compensation consulting firm, considers current compensation levels, benchmarking and other data of peer companies, individual and Company performance, long-term career goals, future leadership potential and succession planning, among other factors, in determining appropriate target compensation levels for our NEOs. The Committee does not use a formula to weight these factors, but instead uses these factors to provide context within which to assess the significance of comparative market data and to differentiate the level of target compensation among our NEOs. 
        After the end of the performance period to which a particular incentive award relates, the Committee reviews our performance relative to the applicable performance targets and recommends payouts based on that  Table of Contents performance. The Committee generally retains the ability to recommend payouts that are above or below actual performance levels for the applicable performance period. For purposes of determining the amount of a payout to recommend, the Committee may also consider infrequent or non-recurring items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, the effects of major corporate transactions or other items that the Committee determines, in its judgment, significantly distort the comparability of our actual performance against the performance targets. 
        Annually, the Committee reviews the design of our named executive officer compensation program, including whether the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In doing so, the Committee assesses whether compensation programs used in prior years have successfully achieved our compensation objectives. The Committee also considers the extent to which our compensation program is designed to achieve our long-term financial and operating goals. The Committee has retained the independent compensation consultant referenced below under "Role of Compensation Consultants" to help analyze certain comparative market data. Certain members of management participate in this process by assembling and summarizing data used by the Committee. The Committee and its independent compensation consultant reviewed our compensation policies and practices, and the Committee has determined that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In 2018, the Company prepared "tally sheets" that summarize the past and present values of each component of each NEO's total compensation. This tool is available to assist Committee members in the evaluation and approval of changes to compensation. 
      Role of Compensation Consultants       
        During 2018, the Committee continued to retain Lyons, Benenson & Company Inc. ("LB") as an independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation matters. LB assisted the Committee in determining the compensation peer group, which is described in more detail below. LB also advised the Committee on competitive compensation practices, mix of compensation elements and comparative market data, which the Committee considered in addressing and determining the appropriate levels of compensation for each NEO relative to the marketplace. 
        The Committee has reviewed the independence of its independent compensation consultant and has determined that no conflicts of interest exist. The Committee has sole authority to retain or replace the independent compensation consultant. The Committee regularly reviews the performance and independence of its independent compensation consultant, as well as fees paid. A representative of the independent compensation consultant attends Committee meetings as requested to serve as a resource on compensation matters. In order to encourage independent review and discussion of compensation matters, the Committee has the authority to, and does from time to time, meet with such representative in executive session. 
      Role of Management       
        Annually, the Committee reviews the performance of our chief executive officer and makes recommendations to the Board regarding his compensation. In doing so, the Committee uses information provided by the independent compensation consultant and certain historical financial and operating performance data provided by management. Our chief executive officer reviews the performance of the other NEOs with the Committee and  Table of Contents makes recommendations on their base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term incentive opportunities. The Company's human resources department provides support for this process. 
      Compensation Peer Group       
        In July 2018, the Committee, in consultation with LB, conducted a review of potential peer group companies based primarily upon criteria including size (both in terms of revenues, market capitalization and EBITDA), business alignment, industry relevance and competition for executive talent. The Committee determined that updates to our prior peer group, which was established in October 2016 upon our emergence from bankruptcy, were appropriate and timely. This updated peer group (listed below) has median revenues of approximately $2.3 billion (with a range of $860 million to $6.0 billion) and median market capitalization of approximately $2.6 billion (with a range of $279 million to $17.0 billion). The Committee recognizes that the companies in this group generally are larger than the Company under the market capitalization measure; nevertheless, the Committee views this peer group as appropriate in light of the importance it ascribes to providing competitive compensation opportunities that are sufficient to attract and retain the talented executives needed to lead the Company.

        When evaluating benchmark data for these peer companies, the median market data is applied to each individual pay component in addition to a total compensation analysis. General industry compensation data is also reviewed by the Committee to provide an additional reference point. This data is based on a broad spectrum of public companies (excluding financial services and retail companies) that had median revenues similar to the Company. 
        The Committee assesses the appropriateness of the peer groups used to benchmark our compensation programs on an annual basis and adds or subtracts members of the peer groups as appropriate. 
    Evaluation of Stockholder "Say-on-Pay" Vote Results       
        This year we are again providing stockholders with the right to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs (see "Proposal No. 2 — Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation"). Approximately 80% of the votes cast at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders voted to approve our executive compensation programs and policies. Although we view this as an endorsement of our executive compensation program, during 2018 we engaged in additional stockholder outreach efforts as discussed in the "Stockholder Engagement Program" section below. The Committee takes stockholder feedback, as well as the results of the "say-on-pay" vote, into account when establishing or modifying our compensation programs.  Table of Contents
    Stockholder Engagement Program       
        Following our 2018 Annual Meeting, we reached out to our largest stockholders representing more than 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We subsequently met with the holders of approximately 45% of our outstanding common stock to discuss our corporate governance program and executive compensation practices. Additionally, two other large stockholders declined our request for a meeting, noting that there were no questions or concerns that would warrant a discussion. 
        The stockholders that we spoke with were generally supportive of our corporate governance program and executive compensation practices. Specific topics discussed included our commitment to diversity, safety and environmental stewardship. Information regarding our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship appears in the "Our Commitment to Safety and Environmental Stewardship" section of this Proxy Statement. Also, with respect to gender diversity on our Board, we are pleased that Holly Keller Koeppel joined our Board in February 2019 and will be standing for election at the Annual Meeting. A summary of Ms. Koeppel's background and qualifications appears in the "Directors Nominated for Election at the Annual Meeting" section of this Proxy Statement. 
        Regarding our executive compensation program, we received positive feedback on the structure of both our annual and long-term incentive plans. Certain stockholders asked that our Committee review our use of volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") as the sole metric under our long-term incentive plan. Our Committee and Board are appreciative of stockholder feedback and considered changes to the VWAP metric in designing our 2018 long-term incentive plan, but ultimately determined, in consultation with our compensation consultant, that the current structure was the appropriate way to align Company performance with long-term stockholder value. Our Committee and Board evaluate our annual and long-term incentive plans annually, including the use of specific metrics like VWAP. 
    Elements of Our Compensation Program       
        The Committee believes that our named executive officers, together with our other executives who have an ability to influence the achievement of our financial and operating objectives, should have a higher percentage of total compensation that is variable and, therefore, subject to greater risk. This provides closer alignment between those executives' total compensation with the short- and long-term interests of stockholders and other stakeholders. 
        In order to achieve the compensation objectives established by the Committee, the Company uses the following compensation elements:
        In general, as the position and amount of responsibility for an executive increase, a greater percentage of that executive's total compensation will be variable. Executives with the highest level and amount of responsibility generally have the lowest percentage of their total compensation fixed as base salary and the highest percentage of their total compensation dependent upon our performance, as reflected in short- or long-term incentive awards.  Table of Contents 
        The following table shows the allocation of total target compensation for each NEO for each of the last three years:

[END TABLE]
      Base Salary —         
        We provide each named executive officer with an annual base salary. Base salaries for our named executive officers depend on each executive's experience and scope of responsibilities as well as the median market data for comparable job positions at companies within our peer group. We increase base salary primarily in response to notable achievements or for additions in scope of responsibilities. In addition, we may increase base salary to remain competitive in the marketplace. 
        During 2018, as part of the Committee's annual compensation review process, the Committee determined that the base salaries for our NEOs should not be increased. Our NEOs have not received base salary increases since 2015. 
      Annual Incentive Compensation Program —         
      Overview —       
        The Committee designed the Annual Incentive Compensation Program to focus our organization on meeting and exceeding certain annual financial and operating objectives by rewarding those key employees with the greatest ability to influence our results. 
        For 2018, the Committee selected Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as the financial performance measures for the program. Adjusted EBITDA constitutes 50% of the total target award, and Free Cash Flow represents 20% of the total target award. Consistent with prior years, the Committee chose environmental and safety metrics as the operating performance measures for the program, each of which constitute 15% of the total target award. The environmental and safety measures continue to be part of the 2018 program because these goals reflect our core values. 
        Early each year, the Committee determines the compensation plan design for the annual cash incentives based on performance from the prior year, as well as other factors. The Committee recommends the annual plan design, as well as the performance targets, to the Board for approval. Annual cash awards contain various  Table of Contents incentive levels based on the participant's accountability and impact on our performance, with target opportunities established as a percentage of base salary based on the median market data. 
        The following table shows the target opportunities available to the NEOs as a percentage of their base salaries and the actual payouts as a percentage of their base salaries for each of the last three years: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
        The following table shows the performance measures used in the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Program for our NEOs, together with the percentage of the total annual cash incentive grant that such component comprises. Each of the components for the NEOs is described in greater detail below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted EBITDA     50% 
 Free Cash Flow     20% 
 Safety Incident Rate     15% 
 Environmental Compliance     15% 
[END TABLE]
        We believe that these performance measures align our compensation packages with both stockholder and employee interests by targeting specific performance goals and operational standards. By identifying meaningful performance measures and by assigning certain measures greater weight, we are able to more closely align compensation to the achievement of those business objectives over which particular employees have the greatest impact. 
        If the target level of performance is achieved with respect to a particular performance measure, the applicable payout percentage for that performance measure will equal 100%. Achievement at the threshold performance level results in an applicable payout percentage that varies based on the performance measure, as shown in the table below. If the maximum level of performance is achieved with respect to a particular performance measure, the payout percentage for that measure will equal 200% of target performance. We interpolate payouts under the  Table of Contents annual cash incentive awards for performance levels that fall between the threshold, target and maximum performance levels. There is no payout for performance that does not meet the threshold level criteria. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted EBITDA     25%   100%   200% 
 Free Cash Flow     25%   100%   200%

 Environmental Compliance     50%   100%   200% 
[END TABLE]
      Adjusted EBITDA —       
        "Adjusted EBITDA" is determined based on our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and excludes items such as acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired sales contracts. The Committee reviewed the budget approved by the Board for 2018, which included Adjusted EBITDA, and set the "target" level for this performance measure at 100% of budget. The threshold payout value for 2018 was set at 70% of the Adjusted EBITDA budget and the maximum payout value was set at 130% of the Adjusted EBITDA budget. The following table shows the threshold, target and maximum levels for the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted EBITDA      $ 242,900,000      $ 347,000,000      $ 451,100,000   
[END TABLE]
      Free Cash Flow —       
        A Free Cash Flow performance measure was added to the program for 2018. "Free Cash Flow" is defined as cash flow from operating activities minus royalty payments and capital expenditures used for maintaining the asset base. Capital spending, if any, applied to new mine development is not deducted from the Free Cash Flow calculation. The Committee reviewed the budget approved by the Board and set the "target" level for this performance measure at 100% of budget. The threshold payout value was set at 70% of the Free Cash Flow budget and the maximum payout value was set at 130% of the budget. The following table shows the threshold, target and maximum levels for the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Free Cash Flow      $ 176,100,000      $ 251,600,000      $ 327,100,000   
[END TABLE]
      Safety Incident Rate —       
        Safety is an important emphasis for the Company and, the Board believes, each of the Company's stakeholders. Strong safety performance leads to improved employee performance and lower costs associated with regulatory citations, insurance and litigation matters, which in turn lead to improved operating performance.  Table of Contents
Because of these factors, the Committee uses Safety Incident Rate as a component of the annual incentive compensation program. "Safety Incident Rate" is determined based on the Company's historical performance and is the number of reportable injuries per 200,000 man hours. The "target" goal for 2018 was set at the Company's three-year average, while the threshold and maximum goals were set at 10% higher than the Company's three-year average and 10% improvement over the Company's three-year average, respectively. In addition, there is no payout for this performance measure if there is a work-related fatality during the fiscal year. The following table shows the threshold, target and maximum levels for the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Safety Incident Rate     1.39     1.26     1.13   
[END TABLE]
      Environmental Compliance —       
        Like safety, environmental compliance is an important goal for the Company. Improved environmental compliance can improve the areas in which our employees live and operate and reduce long-term costs and expenses associated with fines, remediation issues and litigation matters. The Committee has established an environmental compliance component based on Notices of Violation, or NOVs, received by the Company and its subsidiaries. The "target" goal for 2018 was set at the Company's three-year average, while the threshold and maximum goals were set at the Company's three-year average plus one NOV and the Company's three-year average minus one NOV, respectively. The following table shows the threshold, target and maximum levels for the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Program.

      Long-Term Incentive Program         
      Overview —       
        The Committee designed our long-term incentive program to promote decision-making that creates long-term value for our stockholders and other stakeholders. The Committee believes that an effective LTIP should also create strong retention incentives for those key employees who are most likely to influence our long-term performance. 
        The following table shows the components of our long-term incentive program for each of the last three years, together with the percentage associated with such portion of the award compared to the total award granted in that year. Long-term incentive awards contain various incentive levels based on the participant's accountability and potential influence on our performance, with target opportunities established as a percentage of base salary based on the median market data.

 Table of Contents
      2018 Annual Grants —       
        On October 25, 2018, each of our NEOs received awards of restricted stock units ("RSUs") as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 John W. Eaves     19,350     19,350   
 John T. Drexler     8,550     8,550   
 Paul A. Lang     11,750     11,750   
 John A. Ziegler, Jr.      5,050     5,050   
 Robert G. Jones     6,100     6,100   
[END TABLE]
        The time-based and performance-based RSU awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. The performance-based RSU award is earned based on the VWAP of a share of our common stock for any 45-day trading period during the three-year performance period (the "45-day VWAP"), subject to achieving threshold performance of a 45-day VWAP of no less than $99. On the date of grant, the 45-day VWAP was $91.63. The NEOs may earn up to 150% of the target number of performance-based RSUs based on achievement of 45-day VWAP performance levels. While we have not disclosed the target 45-day VWAP performance level for the performance-based RSUs granted in 2018 because we believe this forward-looking measure is not material to an understanding of the compensation earned by our NEOs in the last completed fiscal year, at the time this measure was established, the Committee determined it was appropriately challenging to promote the creation of long-term value for our stockholders. 
      2016-2018 Performance Unit Award Achievement —       
        Our compensation program for 2016 included long-term incentive plan awards of performance units for the 2016-2018 performance period. The performance units were granted prior to the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 and were approved by our prior Personnel and Compensation Committee and Board. Only the performance unit component of the 2016 LTIP was approved, representing a 70% reduction in the long-term incentive awards to our NEOs. The performance unit awards, which are tied to our safety and environmental performance, have historically paid out in cash. In early 2019, the Committee evaluated the level of achievement of the various performance measures for the 2016-2018 performance period and made the following determinations for such performance unit awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Safety Incident Rate   1.04   1.31     50%   0% 
 Environmental Compliance   7 NOVs   2 NOVs     50%   100% 
[END TABLE]
        Total actual amounts paid to each NEO under the 2016 performance unit awards for the Company's 2016-2018 performance are set forth in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table below.  Table of Contents 
      2018 Retention Awards         
        Our Board is keenly focused on senior management succession planning. In consultation with LB, in October 2018 the Board determined to grant one-time retention awards, payable in the form of cash and time-based RSUs, to each of Messrs. Eaves, Drexler and Lang to facilitate the retention of these executives and in execution of the Company's long-term succession plan. These awards represent the Board's increasing focus on the need to retain the key executives who currently lead the Company, as well as executives who may succeed to the key leadership positions in the future. 
        The cash-based retention award will become payable in three equal installments on each of October 25, 2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to the executive's continued service with us through each applicable vesting date. 
        The time-based retention RSUs vest as to 20%, 30% and 50% of the award on October 25, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, subject to the executive's continued service with us through each applicable vesting date. 
        The retention awards are subject to accelerated vesting and payment under certain circumstances as described in more detail below in the section entitled "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control." 
        The following table sets forth the amount of each retention award granted to Messrs. Eaves, Drexler and Lang: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 John W. Eaves      $ 750,000      $ 1,461,200   
 John T. Drexler      $ 340,000      $ 647,424   
 Paul A. Lang      $ 480,000      $ 939,664   
[END TABLE]
      Other Benefits         
         Executive Benefits —  We provide a limited number of executive benefits such as financial planning services to our NEOs and certain other key employees. The purpose of these benefits is to attract and retain executives with a comprehensive compensation package. Executive benefits are taxable to the executives. Executives do not receive any tax gross-up payments on these benefits. 
        Participation in Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Arrangements —  Each of our NEOs is eligible to participate in the same health and welfare plans as our other eligible employees. These plans include medical and dental insurance, life, travel and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short- and long-term disability coverage and participation in our qualified defined benefit pension plan (which was frozen at the end of 2014) and a 401(k) plan. The following is a summary of certain benefit plans and other compensation arrangements available to our NEOs but for which our other employees generally may not be eligible: 
        Supplemental Retirement Plan Benefits —  We maintain a supplemental retirement plan that historically provided eligible employees, including the NEOs, with retirement benefits that would otherwise have been available under our defined benefit pension plan but for certain limitations contained in the Internal Revenue Code. We froze this supplemental retirement plan on December 31, 2014, the same date that we froze our  Table of Contents defined benefit pension plan. No participants earn any service credit after such date. For more information about our defined benefit pension plan and our supplemental retirement plan, including the accumulated benefits attributable to our NEOs, see "Pension Benefits" below. 
         Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan —  We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that historically has allowed eligible employees, including our NEOs, to defer receipt of a portion of their base salaries and certain annual and long-term cash incentive awards until the dates elected by the employees. We have not allowed deferrals under this non-qualified plan since 2015. For more information about our deferred compensation plan, including information about amounts attributable to our NEOs, see "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" below. 
         Change in Control Agreements —  To provide our NEOs and certain other key employees with some financial security in the event their employment with our organization is terminated without cause or under certain circumstances following a change in control, we provide the executives with change in control agreements that provide for cash payments and certain other severance benefits upon a qualifying termination. As a condition to receiving payments under the change in control agreements, the NEO is required to execute a waiver of claims against us and abide by certain non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation requirements. We believe that the change in control agreements provide a meaningful mechanism by which to retain those individuals who are most capable of affecting our future performance. For more information about the change in control agreements with our NEOs, see "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" below. 
    Stock Ownership Guidelines       
        Our Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines which are intended to promote meaningful stock ownership by our NEOs. These guidelines specify a number of shares of our common stock, including unvested RSUs, that our NEOs must accumulate within the later of five years of the implementation of the guidelines or their first receiving an equity grant. The specific shareholding guidelines are determined based on a multiple of base salary, as follows:

 Chief Operating Officer   3 × Salary 
 Chief Financial Officer   3 × Salary 
 Chief Commercial Officer   3 × Salary

[END TABLE]
    Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy       
        Each of our NEOs and directors is subject to the terms of our securities trading policies. Those policies prohibit entering into hedging transactions involving our stock, including trading in or writing "puts" and "calls" or engaging in "short sales," "margining" or any other action designed to offset any change in the value of the Company's stock. Those policies also prohibit NEOs and directors from pledging any Company securities.  Table of Contents
    Impact of Section 162(m) on Compensation       
        Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") that was signed into law December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited to $1 million the U.S. federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid in one year to a company's CEO or any of its three next-highest-paid executive officers (other than its Chief Financial Officer). Compensation that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m) of the Code was exempt from this $1 million limitation. As part of Tax Reform, the ability to rely on this "qualified performance-based compensation" exception was eliminated, and the limitation on deductibility was generally expanded to include all named executive officers. Although we maintain compensation arrangements that were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) prior to Tax Reform, subject to certain transition relief rules, we may no longer take a deduction for any compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1 million. Furthermore, although the Committee may have taken action intended to limit the impact of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, it also believes that the tax deduction is only one of several relevant considerations in setting compensation. The Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's flexibility in structuring compensation programs, even though such programs may result in non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.

 Table of Contents forfeitures. The determination of the grant date fair value is subject to certain estimates and assumptions described in Note 19, Stock-Based Compensation and Other Incentive Plans, to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The actual value, if any, that the NEOs will realize from the stock awards is a function of a value of the underlying shares if and when the awards vest and, for performance-based awards, the level of attainment of the applicable performance goal.  
Amounts for the performance-based RSU awards were calculated based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. For these amounts, see the "Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards" column of the "Grants of Plan Based Awards for the Year Ended December 31, 2018" table below. The following are the values of the performance-based awards as of the grant date assuming attainment of the maximum level of performance: Mr. Eaves — $3,024,986; Mr. Drexler — $1,336,622; Mr. Lang — $1,836,878; Mr. Ziegler — $789,467; Mr. Jones — $953,613.

      Pension Benefits         
         Defined Benefit Pension Plan.    We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering all of our eligible employees, including our NEOs. We froze our pension plan on December 31, 2014. No participants earn any service credit after such date. Under the plan, a cash balance account was established for each participant. Participants become vested in their cash balance accounts after serving three years with us. Upon retirement or upon termination of employment following three years of service with us, participants or their beneficiaries may elect to receive benefits in a lump sum, in installments over a period of time or at a later date. Under the terms of the plan, normal retirement occurs on the first day of the month following the date a participant turns 65. We credit each participant's cash balance account with an interest amount based on the U.S. Treasury rate, subject to an annual minimum rate of 4.25%. 
        Supplemental Retirement Plan.    We sponsor a supplemental retirement plan covering all of our eligible employees, including our NEOs, whose retirement benefits under our defined benefit pension plan are limited by the Internal Revenue Code. We froze our supplemental retirement plan on December 31, 2014. Subject to the limitations contained in the Code, benefits under the supplemental retirement plan will be paid six months after termination in a lump sum.  Table of Contents

      Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation         
        We maintain a deferred compensation plan that historically has allowed eligible employees to defer receipt of their base salaries and/or incentive awards until the dates elected by the employees. We have not allowed deferrals under the plan since 2015. The cash amounts previously deferred are invested in accounts that mirror the gains and/or losses of a number of different investment funds. These investment funds are substantially similar to the investment alternatives offered to participants in our 401(k) plan. The plan has never offered any above-market rates of return to any of our NEOs. Participants are always vested in their deferrals under the plan and any related earnings. 
        Under the plan, we credit each participant's account with the number of units equal to the number of shares or units that the participant could purchase or receive with the amount of compensation deferred under the plan on the date we credit the participant's account, based upon the fair market value of the underlying investment on that date. We will pay the amount of compensation deferred under the plan to the participant (or to their designated beneficiary in the event of death) in annual installments or in a lump sum, at the participant's election, following the participant's termination of employment or on the date or dates specified by the participant in his payment election. The amount we pay will be based on the number of units credited to each participant's account, valued on the basis of the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares or units of the underlying investment on the date payment occurs. We may also pay a participant the amount of  Table of Contents compensation deferred under the plan prior to the date the participant initially elected to receive payment if we determine that the employee has a demonstrated financial hardship.

      Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control         
        We maintain certain agreements or arrangements with each of our NEOs and other executives that provide for the payment or acceleration of certain benefits in the event that the executive's employment is terminated under certain circumstances or following a change in control. In addition to the benefits described below, the NEOs would also be entitled to receive certain benefits under our defined benefit and pension plan, supplemental retirement plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plan. See the subsection entitled "Pension Benefits" for more information on the benefits accumulated under our defined benefit pension plan and our supplemental retirement plan that are attributable to each of the NEOs and the subsection entitled "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" for more information on the aggregate balance maintained under our deferred compensation plan by each of the NEOs. 
        Our NEOs' change in control agreements provide "double trigger" payments on involuntary termination of employment in connection with a change in control. 
    Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment       
        We maintain change in control agreements with our NEOs and other executives. Under the change in control agreements, we may be required to provide compensation in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control of the Company. As a condition to each executive's entitlement to receive payments under the change in control agreements, the executive is required to execute a waiver of claims against us and to abide by certain non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation requirements. 
         Voluntary termination and termination for cause —  Each of the NEOs may terminate his employment at any time. In addition, we may terminate the employment of the NEOs for cause for any of the following reasons: Table of Contents 
        Under the terms of the change in control agreements, if we terminate an executive's employment for cause or if an executive voluntarily terminates his employment, then we will pay the executive an amount equal to the executive's accrued and unpaid base salary. 
        The RSU award agreements provide that, if an executive voluntarily terminates his employment (other than for good reason or due to retirement), his unvested RSUs will be forfeited. If we terminate an executive's employment for cause, his RSUs, whether vested or unvested, will be forfeited. 
         Involuntary termination prior to a change in control —  Under the change in control agreements, each of the NEOs may be entitled to certain benefits on an involuntary termination. If we terminate an executive without cause prior to a change in control, then under the terms of the change in control agreement we will pay the executive a lump sum cash amount equal to the following:
        Also, we have agreed to reimburse the NEOs for the cost of financial counseling services (up to a maximum of $5,000) for a period of 12 months (24 months for Mr. Eaves), and the cost of reasonable outplacement services for a period of 12 months (24 months for Mr. Eaves). 
        The RSU award agreements provide for the following treatment of the awards if an NEO's employment is terminated by us without cause or by the NEO for good reason: Table of Contents
        The retention awards granted to Messrs. Eaves, Drexler and Lang in October 2018 provide for the following treatment if the executive's service with us is terminated by us without cause or by the executive for good reason:

         Termination in connection with a change in control —  Under the change in control agreements, each of the NEOs may be entitled to certain benefits if we terminate the executive's employment for reasons other than cause following a change in control or if the executive terminates his employment for "good reason" (as defined in the executive's change in control agreement) during the two years following a change in control. 
        The change in control agreements define a "change in control" to mean any of the following: Table of Contents holders of our common stock immediately prior to the merger maintain substantially the same proportionate ownership of the common stock of the surviving entity immediately after the merger; 
        If we terminate an NEO for reasons other than cause following a change in control or if the NEO terminates his employment for good reason during the two years following a change in control, then, under the terms of the change in control agreement, we will pay the executive a lump sum cash amount equal to the following:
        Also, we have agreed to reimburse each NEO for the cost of financial counseling services (up to a maximum of $5,000) for a period of 24 months (36 months for Mr. Eaves), and the cost of reasonable outplacement services for a period of 24 months (36 months for Mr. Eaves). 
        The RSU award agreements provide for accelerated vesting immediately on a change in control (see below under "Potential Payments upon Change in Control"). As a result, the NEOs would not receive any additional benefits with respect to their RSUs on termination of employment following a change in control. 
        The retention awards granted to Messrs. Eaves, Drexler and Lang in October 2018 provide for accelerated vesting immediately on a change in control (see below under "Potential Payments upon Change in Control").

      Pay Ratio Disclosure         
        As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO. We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
        There were no changes to the employee population or compensation programs from 2017 to 2018 that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. As a result, we are using the same median employee identified in the CEO Pay Ratio disclosure included in our 2018 proxy statement. This employee represented the median employee following an examination of the W-2 reported earnings for all employees who were employed by us on October 1, 2017, excluding our CEO. We included all employees in this analysis, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis, and annualized the earnings for any employee who was hired after January 1 or had a break in employment between January 1, 2017 and October 1, 2017. 
        The median employee is a full-time hourly employee who works in our eastern operations and had no change in role and no significant change to compensation from 2017 to 2018. For the median employee, we calculated the annual total compensation for such employee for 2018 using the same methodology we used for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table earlier in this section. 
        For 2018, the value of the annual total compensation of this employee was $103,884, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $9,227,715. The resulting pay ratio is 89:1.  Table of Contents 
    DIRECTOR COMPENSATION         
        Our director compensation program is designed to compensate our non-employee directors for the amount of work required for a company of our size and scope and to align the interests of our non-employee directors with the long-term interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders. 
        The Committee annually reviews the compensation structure and amounts for our non-employee directors. From time to time, the Committee engages a compensation consultant to provide survey or proxy benchmarking data on the structure and amount of director compensation for the Company's peer group. During 2018, the Committee retained LB to conduct such a benchmarking analysis. Based upon the analysis and guidance from LB, the Committee recommended that the Board not make any changes to the Company's director compensation program. The Committee believes the amount of compensation provided is reasonable for the amount of work required by our non-employee directors, and the elements of this program align the interests of our non-employee directors with the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
         Compensation of Our Board.    The compensation structure for our non-employee directors for 2018 is set forth below:

         Stock Ownership Guidelines.    In order to align the interests of our non-employee directors with the long-term interests of our stockholders, the Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. Each newly elected non-employee director is expected to satisfy this goal within five years of becoming a director. 
        Under the guidelines, each non-employee director is required to own a number of shares of our common stock equal in value to three times the value of the annual retainer. Each non-employee director's ownership is reviewed annually, with each share of common stock held by a non-employee director being valued at the Company's average closing price for the 90 days prior to the measurement date. In the event that a non-employee director does not meet the applicable guideline at any time after the initial five-year period, the director is required to hold a minimum of 67% of the net shares resulting from any future vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units until the guideline is met.

Management is primarily responsible for the financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal controls, while the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
        In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and has met with and held discussions with management, the Company's internal auditors and with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss those financial statements and related matters. The Audit Committee reviewed with the Company's internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee also met, at least quarterly, with the auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed with the independent auditors their judgment as to the quality and the appropriateness of the Company's accounting principles and financial controls and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. 
        The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter prescribed by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors that firm's independence, including those matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee considered whether the performance by Ernst & Young LLP of non-audit services was compatible with their independence. 
        In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the audited consolidated financial statements to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has retained Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
        While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in its charter, it is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate or are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the responsibility of management and the independent auditor.

    SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE         
        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's directors, executive officers and any persons beneficially holding more than 10% of the Company's common stock to report their ownership of common stock and any changes in that ownership to the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. The SEC has established specific due dates for these reports, and the Company is required to report in this proxy statement any failure to file by these dates. Based solely on a review of the copies of the reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other such statements were required, the Company believes that all such reports of the Company's directors and executive officers were filed on a timely basis.

    Transactions with Related Persons       
   Registration Rights Agreement 
        On November 17, 2016, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with Monarch Alternative Capital LP and certain other affiliated funds (collectively, "Monarch"). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has agreed that, upon Monarch's request, it will file a registration statement to permit Monarch to sell shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Demands for registration by Monarch are subject to (i) a minimum aggregate proceeds size of $35 million, (ii) a limit of one demand per any six-month period and (iii) a limit of three demands in the aggregate. If the Company is eligible to use Form S-3, Monarch has the right to request that the Company file a shelf registration statement. Monarch's right to sell shares pursuant to the shelf registration statement is subject to the same limitations described above for demand registration rights. If the Company undertakes a registered public offering (subject to customary exceptions), the Company must notify Monarch and offer it the opportunity to participate in such offering, subject to customary cutback rights. Monarch's registration rights are subject to customary blackout restrictions. The Registration Rights Agreement also provides restrictions on Monarch's ability to transfer ownership of its Class A Common Stock to competitors, with certain exceptions, set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement. 
        The Company has agreed to pay customary expenses associated with any registration under the Registration Rights Agreement, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions. 
        The Registration Rights Agreement terminates in the event (i) Monarch provides written notification of termination to the Company, (ii) Monarch's shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the Registration Rights Agreement have been sold and are freely tradeable, or (iii) Monarch owns less than 5% of the outstanding Class A Common Stock.
