Dear Fellow Stockholders: 
We invite you to join us at the 2019 Annual Stockholders' Meeting (the "Annual Meeting") of Great Elm Capital Corp., beginning at 8:30 a.m. local time, on May 8, 2019, at the Westin Waltham Boston, 70 3rd Avenue, Waltham, MA 02451. 
The Notice of Annual Stockholders' Meeting and proxy statement accompanying this letter describe the business that will be discussed and voted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
This year, we have elected to deliver our proxy materials to the majority of our stockholders over the Internet. On or about March 29, 2019, we will mail a notice of Internet availability (the "Notice") and make our proxy materials available to our stockholders over the Internet. The Notice contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet, as well as how to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials. This new approach conserves natural resources, reduces our printing and distribution costs and expedites stockholders' receipt of proxy materials. 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote and submit your proxies over the Internet or by mail as soon as possible. This will not prevent you from voting in person. If you attend the Annual Meeting you will have the right to revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person. If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee of record, please follow the voting instructions appearing on your voting instruction card. Your vote and participation in our governance is very important to us. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors, I want to thank you for your continued support. 
Sincerely, 
/s/ Peter A. Reed

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Proxy Materials 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Why did I receive the Notice about GECC's proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
Since you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on March 22, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"), you are considered a stockholder of record.

[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Why did I receive the Notice instead of a paper copy of the full set of proxy materials?   
[END TABLE]
We will be utilizing the "notice and access" delivery method under the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Rule 14a-16, which allows companies to provide their proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing the Notice instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials to a majority of our stockholders. The Notice contains instructions on how to access the proxy materials and submit your vote over the Internet and how you may request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, if you wish. If you previously requested printed copies of the proxy materials, we have provided you with printed copies of the proxy materials instead of the Notice.

[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
You may elect that your identity and individual vote be held confidential by marking the appropriate box on your proxy card, online ballot or the ballot you receive at the Annual Meeting. Confidentiality elections will not apply to the extent that voting disclosure is required by law or is necessary or appropriate to assert or defend any claim relating to voting. 
Confidentiality will also not apply with respect to any matter for which votes are solicited in opposition to the director nominee or voting recommendations of our Board of Directors, unless the persons engaging in the opposing solicitation provide stockholders with confidential voting comparable to that which we provide. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Where can I find the voting results?  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  What shares can I vote?  
[END TABLE]
You are entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date. You may vote all shares owned by you on the Record Date, including (a) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record and (b) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a bank, broker or other nominee. On the Record Date, 10,652,401 shares of our common stock were outstanding. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?   
[END TABLE]
Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee rather than having the shares registered directly in their own name. Summarized below are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
Stockholder of Record 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are the stockholder of record of the shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant a proxy to vote your shares to representatives from the Company or to another person, or to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial Owner 
If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, it is likely that they are registered in the name of the nominee and you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name. 
As the beneficial owner of shares held for your account, you have the right to direct the registered holder to vote your shares as you instruct, and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Your bank, broker, plan trustee or other nominee has provided a voting instruction card for you to use in directing how your shares are to be voted. However, since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, unless you obtain a legal proxy from the registered holder of the shares giving you the right to do so. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  How can I vote?  
[END TABLE]
For directions on how to vote, please refer to the following instructions and those included on the Notice or your proxy card or voting instruction card. Whether you hold your shares as a stockholder of record or as a beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are to be voted without attending the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Voting in Person – You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, those shares that you hold in your name as the stockholder of record. You may vote in person shares for which you are the beneficial owner only by obtaining a legal proxy giving you the right to vote the shares from the bank, broker or other nominee that is the registered holder of your shares. We will provide a ballot to you when you arrive. 
Voting by Internet – Stockholders may vote over the Internet by following the instructions on the Notice, proxy card or voting instruction card. 
Voting by Telephone – Most stockholders who are beneficial owners of their shares and have received a voting instruction card may vote by phone by calling the number specified on the voting instruction card provided by their bank, broker or nominee. These stockholders should check the card for telephone voting availability. Stockholders of record may vote by phone by calling the number specified on the Notice or proxy card.  Voting by Mail – Stockholders who have received a paper copy of the proxy materials may vote by mail by signing, dating and returning their proxy card or voting instruction card in the envelope provided. If you only received the Notice and wish to vote by proxy via mail, you may do so by requesting printed copies of the proxy materials and then filling out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  How will my shares be voted?  
[END TABLE]
Your shares will be voted as you specifically instruct on your online ballot, proxy card or voting instruction card, as applicable. If you complete and submit your online ballot or sign and return your proxy card or voting instruction card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board of Directors and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matters that properly come before the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.  Will shares I hold in my brokerage account be voted if I do not provide timely voting instructions?   
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held through a brokerage firm, they will be voted as you instruct on the voting instruction card provided by your broker. If you sign and return your card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board of Directors and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
If you do not provide timely instructions as to how your brokerage shares are to be voted, your broker will have the authority to vote them only on the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Your broker will be prohibited from voting your shares on the election of the Class III director. "Broker non-votes" will be counted only for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting and not as votes cast. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
19.  Will shares that I own as a stockholder of record be voted if I do not timely complete and submit my  online ballot or return my proxy card?  
[END TABLE]
Shares that you own as a stockholder of record will be voted as you instruct on your online ballot, proxy card or voting instruction card, as applicable. If you complete and submit your online ballot or sign and return your proxy card without giving specific instructions, they will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board of Directors and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
If you do not timely complete and submit your online ballot or return your proxy card, your shares will not be voted unless you or your proxy holder attends the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof and votes in person as described in Question 16. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
20.  When is the deadline to vote  
[END TABLE]
If you hold shares as the stockholder of record, your vote by proxy must be received before the polls close at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. The deadline for voting by Internet or telephone is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 7, 2019. 
If you hold shares as a beneficial owner, please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
21.  May I change or revoke my vote?  
[END TABLE]
You may change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting.  If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote by granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy), by providing a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth in Question 24 prior to your shares being voted, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request. 
For shares you hold as a beneficial owner, you may change your vote by timely submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee (which revokes your earlier instructions), or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from the nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
22.  Who will serve as inspector of elections?  
[END TABLE]
The inspector of elections will be a representative of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. 
Attending the Annual Meeting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
23.  Who can attend the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
You may attend the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof only if you were a stockholder of ours at the close of business on the Record Date, or you hold a valid proxy to vote at the meeting. You should be prepared to present photo identification to be admitted to the meeting. 
If you are not a stockholder of record but are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide proof of beneficial ownership on the Record Date, such as your most recent account statement prior to the Record Date, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your nominee, or other similar evidence of share ownership. 
The meeting will begin promptly at 8:30 a.m. local time. Please allow ample time for check-in procedures.

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Stockholders who wish to (1) submit director nominees for inclusion in our proxy materials for next year's Annual Stockholders' Meeting or (2) nominate director candidates or present other items of business directly at   next year's Annual Stockholders' Meeting must give written notice of their intention to do so in accordance with the deadlines described below to our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth in Question 24. Any such notice also must include the information required by our Bylaws and must be updated and supplemented as provided in the Bylaws. 
Notice of director nominees submitted must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time at least 120 days but not more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date the proxy statement was first sent to stockholders in connection with the last Annual Stockholders' Meeting. The period for the receipt from stockholders of any such notice for the 2020 Annual Stockholders' Meeting will begin on October 31, 2019 and end on November 30, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. 
In the event that the date of the Annual Stockholders' Meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's Annual Stockholders' Meeting, notice by stockholders must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time at least 120 days but not more than 150 days prior to the date of such Annual Stockholders' Meeting, as originally convened, or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. 
These above-mentioned notice requirements applicable under our advance notice Bylaw provisions do not apply to stockholder proposals intended for inclusion in our proxy materials under the SEC's Stockholder Proposal Rule (Rule 14a-8).

[END TABLE]
Stockholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors by writing to our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth in Question 24. A recommendation must be accompanied by a statement from the candidate that he or she would give favorable consideration to serving on the board and should include sufficient biographical and other information concerning the candidate and his or her qualifications to permit the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to make an informed decision as to whether further consideration of the candidate would be warranted.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEE NAMED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.  Proposal 2: Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The members of the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors believe the continued retention of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm is in our best interest. We do not anticipate representatives of Deloitte will be present at the Annual Meeting. Thus, it is not expected that they will have an opportunity to make a statement regarding their services, or be available to respond to questions. The Board of Directors does not know of any direct or indirect financial interest of Deloitte in the Company. Ratification requires the receipt of "FOR" votes constituting a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting, assuming a quorum is present. 
Deloitte served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The audit reports of Deloitte on the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the period ended December 31, 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
Principal Accountant Fees and Services. The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by Deloitte for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit fees    $ 412,500      $ 400,500   
 Audit-related fees      —        —   
 Tax fees      20,000        20,000   
 All other fees      —        —   
 Total fees    $ 432,500      $ 420,500   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audits of our financial statements, review of financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by Deloitte in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. 
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 
Tax Fees. Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and local tax compliance. 
All Other Fees. All other fees would include fees for products and services other than the services reported above. 
Pre-Approval Policy. Our Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that our Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the auditor's independence. 
Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to our Audit Committee for specific pre-approval, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of our Audit Committee. However, our Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to our Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Our Audit Committee has not delegated its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management as of December 31, 2018. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 2.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
As of December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors was composed of the three directors named below, each of whom have been determined by our Board of Directors to be independent directors. Our Board of Directors also has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and that Mr. Horsey is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee's charter, adopted by the board, is posted on our website at www.greatelmcc.com. 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities include appointing our independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approving both audit and non-audit services to be provided by the firm and assisting the Board of Directors in providing oversight of our financial reporting process. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with our independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. 
It is not the Audit Committee's responsibility to plan or conduct audits or to determine that our financial statements and disclosures are complete, accurate and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and applicable laws, rules and regulations. Management is responsible for our financial statements, including the estimates and judgments on which they are based, as well as our financial reporting processes, accounting policies, internal audit function, internal accounting controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and risk management. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte, is responsible for performing an audit of our annual financial statements, expressing an opinion as to the conformity of the annual financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and reviewing our quarterly financial statements. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, which requires the independent registered public accounting firm to communicate information to the Audit Committee regarding the scope and results of its audit of our financial statements, including information with respect to the firm's responsibilities under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, significant accounting policies, management judgments and estimates, any significant unusual transactions or audit adjustments, any disagreements with management and any difficulties encountered in performing the audit and other such matters required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by those standards. 
The Audit Committee also received from Deloitte a report providing the disclosures required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. Deloitte also has discussed its independence with the Audit Committee and confirmed in the report that, in its professional judgment, it is independent of us within the meaning of the federal securities laws. 
The Audit Committee also has reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's reports on the financial statements and internal controls. Management has confirmed to the Audit Committee that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that management has maintained an effective system of internal controls. Deloitte has expressed its professional opinions that the financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and former Chief Financial Officer have reviewed with the Audit Committee the certifications that each filed with the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the policies and procedures management has adopted to support the certifications. 
Based on these considerations, the Audit Committee has recommended to our Board of Directors that our audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Mark Kuperschmid 
Michael C. Speller  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Independence 
The Nasdaq Rules require listed companies to have a board of directors with at least a majority of "Independent Directors" (as such term is defined in the Nasdaq Rules). Under the Nasdaq Rules, in order for a director to be deemed independent, the board of directors must determine that the individual does not have a relationship that would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. 
In accordance with the Nasdaq's Rules, our Board of Directors will annually determine each director's independence. We will not consider a director independent unless our Board of Directors has determined that he or she has no material relationship with us or GECM. We will monitor the relationships of our directors and officers through a questionnaire each director will complete no less frequently than annually and update periodically as information provided in the most recent questionnaire changes. In order to evaluate the materiality of any such relationship, our Board of Directors will use the definition in Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), which provides that a director of a BDC shall be considered to be independent if he or she is not an "interested person" of the BDC, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act. Our Board of Directors determined that each of the directors is independent and has no relationship with us, except as a director and stockholder, with the exception of Messrs. Reed and Stuart. 
Our governance guidelines require any member of our Board of Directors who has previously been determined to be independent to inform the Chairman of our Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Corporate Secretary of any change in circumstance that may cause his or her status as an Independent Director to change. Our Board of Directors limits membership on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to Independent Directors. 
Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight 
As is the case with virtually all investment companies, including externally managed BDCs such as GECC (as distinguished from operating companies), service providers to GECC, primarily GECM (located at 800 South Street, Suite 230, Waltham, MA 02453), have responsibility for the day-to-day management of GECC, which includes responsibility for risk management (including management of investment performance and investment risk, valuation risk, issuer and counterparty credit risk, compliance risk and operational risk). 
Our Audit Committee (which consists only of Independent Directors) meets regularly, and between meetings the Audit Committee Chair maintains contact with our independent registered public accounting firm and our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our Audit Committee from time to time meets with the independent valuation services that evaluate certain of our securities holdings for which there are not readily available market values. Our Board of Directors also receives periodic presentations from senior personnel of GECM regarding risk management generally, as well as periodic presentations regarding specific operational, compliance or investment areas such as business continuity, personal trading, valuation, credit and investment research. Our Board of Directors has adopted policies and procedures designed to address certain risks. In addition, GECC, GECM and our other service providers have adopted a variety of policies, procedures and controls designed to address particular risks to us. However, it is not possible to eliminate all of the risks. Our Board of Directors also receives reports from our legal counsel or lawyers of GECM regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. The Board of Directors oversight role does not make our Board of Directors a guarantor of our investments or activities or the activities of any of our service providers. 
Our Board of Directors also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of the Chief Compliance Officer. Our Board of Directors will annually review a written report from our Chief Compliance Officer discussing the adequacy and effectiveness of our and our service providers' respective compliance policies and procedures.  Our Board of Directors believes its role in risk oversight is effective and appropriate given the extensive regulation to which it is already subject as a BDC. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements that control the levels of risk in our business and operations. For example, our ability to incur indebtedness is limited such that our asset coverage must equal at least 150% immediately after each time we incur indebtedness, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our gross assets in "qualifying assets" and are not generally permitted to invest in any portfolio company in which one of our affiliates currently has an investment. 
Board of Directors Composition and Leadership Structure 
The Investment Company Act requires that at least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors be independent directors. Currently, three of our five directors are independent directors. The Chairman of our Board of Directors is an interested person with respect to GECC. Our Board of Directors has designated Mark Kuperschmid as our Lead Independent Director. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Kuperschmid is responsible for coordinating the activities of the other independent directors and for such other duties as are assigned, from time to time, by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that its leadership structure, in which over 80% of the directors are not affiliated with GECM, is appropriate in light of the services that GECM and its affiliates provide to us and the potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships. 
Information About Each Director's Experience, Qualifications, Attributes or Skills 
Our Board of Directors believes that the significance of each director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience that is important for one director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the board level, with no single director, or particular factor, being indicative of board effectiveness. However, our Board of Directors believes that directors need to have the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with our management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties – our Board of Directors believes that its members satisfy this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a director's educational background; business, professional training or practice (e.g., medicine, accounting or law), public service or academic positions; experience from service as a board member (including our Board of Directors) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other life experiences. To assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the directors are counseled by our internal and outside legal counsel, who interact with GECM, and also may benefit from information provided by our or GECM's legal counsel. Our Board of Directors and its committees have the ability to engage their own legal counsel and other experts as appropriate. The Board of Directors evaluates its performance on an annual basis. 
Committees of our Board of Directors 
As of December 31, 2018, GECC maintains an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our Board of Directors held four regular board meetings and two special meetings, seven Audit Committee meetings, one Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting and two Compensation Committee meetings. All directors who were directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 attended 100% of the aggregate number of meetings of our Board of Directors and of the respective committees on which they served. Other than Peter A. Reed, no other member of our Board of Directors attended last year's Annual Stockholders' Meeting. 
We require each director to make a diligent effort to attend all Board of Directors and committee meetings, and encourage directors to attend the Annual Stockholders' Meeting. 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to an Audit Committee Charter approved by our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee Charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee, which include selecting or retaining each year an independent registered public accounting firm (the "auditors") to audit   our annual financial statements; reviewing and discussing with management and the auditors our annual audited financial statements, including disclosures made in management's discussion and analysis, and recommending to our Board of Directors whether the audited financial statements should be included in our annual report on Form 10-K; reviewing and discussing with management and the auditors our quarterly financial statements prior to the filing of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; pre-approving our auditors' engagement to render audit and/or permissible non-audit services; evaluating the qualifications, performance and independence of the auditors; reviewing preliminary valuations of the investment adviser and independent valuation firms and recommending valuations to our Board of Directors; and recommending compensation of our Chief Financial Officer to our Board of Directors for determination. Our Audit Committee is currently composed of three persons: Messrs. Horsey, Kuperschmid and Speller, all of whom are considered independent directors under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). Mr. Horsey currently serves as Chair of the Audit Committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Horsey qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee Charter is available on our website (http://www.greatelmcc.com). 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for selecting qualified nominees to be elected to our Board of Directors by stockholders; identifying, selecting or recommending qualified nominees to fill any vacancies on our Board of Directors or a committee hereof; developing and recommending to our Board of Directors a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the Company; overseeing the evaluation of our Board of Directors and management; and undertaking such other duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be delegated by our Board of Directors to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is composed of three persons: Messrs. Horsey, Kuperschmid and Speller, all of whom are considered independent directors under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). Mr. Kuperschmid currently serves as the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a written Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter which is available on our website (http://www.greatelmcc.com). 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholder recommendations for possible nominees for election as directors when such recommendations are submitted in accordance with our Bylaws, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding director nominations. Nominations should be sent to Corporate Secretary, Great Elm Capital Corp., 800 South Street, Suite 230, Waltham, MA 02453. To have a candidate considered by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a stockholder must submit the recommendation in writing and must include the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ The name of the stockholder and evidence of the persons ownership of our stock, including the number of  shares owned and the length of time of the ownership;  
▪ The name of the candidate, the candidates resume or a listing of his or her qualifications to be a  director and the persons consent to be named as a director if selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and nominated to our Board of Directors; and  
▪ If requested by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a completed and signed directors and  officers questionnaire in our customary form.  
[END TABLE]
Criteria considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in evaluating the qualifications of individuals for election as members of our Board of Directors include, to the extent required, compliance with the independence and other applicable requirements of the federal securities laws, the Nasdaq Rules, and any other applicable laws, rules, or regulations; the ability to contribute to the effective management of GECC, taking into account the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with our management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties; educational background, business, professional training or practice (e.g., medicine, accounting or law), public service or academic positions, experience from service as a board member (including our Board of Directors) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or   significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations, and/or other life experiences; and personal and professional integrity, character, time availability in light of other commitments, dedication, conflicts of interest and such other relevant factors that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers appropriate. Our Board of Directors also believes it is appropriate for members of our management to serve as a member of our Board of Directors. In addition, although our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider whether a potential candidate's professional experience, education, skills and other individual qualities and attributes, including gender, race or national origin, would provide beneficial diversity of skills, experience or perspective to our Board of Directors' membership and collective attributes. Such considerations will vary based on our Board of Directors' existing membership and other factors, such as the strength of a potential nominee's overall qualifications relative to diversity considerations. 
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining, or recommending to our Board of Directors for determining, the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers, paid directly by us, if any. Additionally, the Compensation Committee assists our Board of Directors with all matters related to compensation, as directed by our Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee may delegate any of its responsibilities to a subcommittee comprised of one or more members of the Compensation Committee. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Horsey, Kuperschmid and Speller, all of whom are considered independent directors under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). Mr. Speller currently serves as the Chair of the Compensation Committee. None of our executive officers is directly compensated by us and, as a result, the Compensation Committee does not produce and/or review and report on executive compensation practices. Our executive officers do not have a role in determining or recommending director compensation. The Compensation Committee Charter is available on our website (www.greatelmcc.com).

[END TABLE]
(1) In fiscal year 2018, we did not maintain a stock or option plan, non-equity incentive plan or pension plan for our directors. 
Compensation of Directors 
No compensation is paid by us to directors who are "interested persons." Our independent directors each receive an annual fee of $45,000. They also receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending each board meeting and each committee meeting. In addition, the chairman of each of our board's standing committees receives an annual fee of $10,000 for his or her additional services in these capacities. Each member of these committees receives a $5,000 annual fee for serving on these committees. In addition, we purchased directors' and officers' liability insurance on behalf of our directors and officers. Independent directors also have the option to receive their directors' fees paid in shares of our common stock issued at a price per share equal to the greater of net asset value or the market price at the time of payment. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
We do not provide direct compensation to our officers. Mr. Reed and Mr. Kleinman are indirectly entitled to a portion of any investment advisory fees paid by us to GECM under our Investment Management Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2016 (the "Investment Management Agreement"), through their financial interests in affiliates of GECM. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, are paid by GECM, subject to reimbursement by us of our allocable portion of such compensation under an Administration Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2016 (the "Administration Agreement"). 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Horsey, Kuperschmid and Speller served on our Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018. Currently, none of our executive officers are compensated by us, and as such, our Compensation Committee is not required to produce a report on executive officer compensation for inclusion herein. No current or past executive officers or employees of ours or our affiliates serve on our Compensation Committee.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
GECM initially hired all of the employees of MAST Capital, certain of whom for a time continued to be employees of MAST Capital. As of the date of this proxy statement, GECM and MAST Capital do not share any employees. Affiliates of GECM entered into agreements with MAST Capital and the initial employees of GECM under which MAST Capital and such employees have indirect financial interests in GECM's net cash flows from the Investment Management Agreement. 
Funds managed by MAST Capital own approximately 9% of GEC. Mr. Reed serves as a Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of GEC, in addition to being our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of GECM. Mr. Kleinman serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of GEC, in addition to being our Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary. GEC owns approximately 18.5% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Reed, Mr. Kleinman and certain of GECM's initial employees were employees of MAST Capital where they managed private investment funds, with investment objectives similar to ours. 
In addition, certain of our executive officers and directors and the members of GECM's investment committee serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or related lines of business as GECC or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by advisers affiliated with GECM and any advisers that may in the future become affiliated with GEC. GECM entered into a consulting contract with FS Services LLC that retained Gregg Felton, Full Circle's former chief executive officer, and John Stuart, Full Circle's former chairman and a member of our Board of Directors. 
As of December 31, 2018, we and certain private investment funds managed by MAST Capital (the "MAST Funds") held debt securities issued by Avanti. The Avanti securities held by us were contributed to us by the MAST Funds per the Subscription Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2016. 
We entered into a license agreement with GEC pursuant to which GEC granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "Great Elm Capital Corp." Under the license agreement, we have a right to use the "Great Elm Capital Corp." name and logo for so long as GECM, or an affiliate thereof, remains our investment adviser. 
We are party to the Investment Management Agreement with GECM, which is wholly-owned by GEC. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, GECM manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. We pay GECM a fee for investment management services, which consisted of $3.0 million in base management fees and $0.2 million in incentive fees (the incentive fees were deferred in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and $2.3 million in base management fees and $4.4 million in incentive fees for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
We are also party to the Administration Agreement with GECM. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, GECM furnishes us with, or otherwise arranges for the provision of, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and other such services as our administrator. We bear all costs and expenses that are incurred in our operation and transactions and not specifically assumed by GECM pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company reimbursed GECM in the amount of $1.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for services provided under the Administration Agreement. 
We have established a written policy to govern the review of potential related party transactions. GECM, our Chief Compliance Officer, and any other officers designated by us are required to review the facts and circumstances of transactions with certain affiliates, and to screen any such transactions, for potential compliance issues under Section 57(h) of the Investment Company Act.  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, our directors and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of our common stock, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and to us. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and we are required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports and written representations delivered to us by such persons, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the executive officers, directors and stockholders were timely satisfied, with the exception of a statement of changes of beneficial ownership of securities on Form 4 filed on behalf of Mark Kuperschmid to report an inadvertent failure to timely report one transaction. 
Certain Risks Represented by Our Investments 
Please see the risks identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, especially "Item 1A.
