Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders  to be held June 4, 2019
Dear Stockholder:
Our annual stockholders' meeting will be held on June 4, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. central time, at our principal executive offices located at 2901 Butterfield Road in Oak Brook, Illinois 60523. At our annual meeting, we will ask you to consider and vote upon:
If you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on March 29, 2019, you may vote at the annual meeting and any postponements or adjournments of the meeting. Instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to all of our stockholders, we are using the "Notice and Access" method of providing proxy materials to stockholders via the Internet. This process provides stockholders with a convenient and quick way to access the proxy materials and vote, while lowering our costs and reducing the environmental impact of our meeting. Accordingly, on or about April 1, 2019, we will begin mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or Notice, to stockholders, and will post our proxy materials on the website referenced in the Notice. As more fully described in the Notice, stockholders may choose to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or may request to receive a printed set of our proxy materials.
Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting and vote in person, we urge you to have your vote recorded as early as possible. Stockholders have the following three options for submitting their votes by proxy: (1) via the Internet; (2) by telephone; or (3) by mail, using the paper proxy card.
Your vote is very important! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expenses associated with soliciting stockholder votes.
By order of the Board of Directors, 
Cathleen M. Hrtanek  Secretary

INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
The board of directors of Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (referred to herein as the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), a Maryland corporation, is soliciting your vote for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. At the meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon:

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting to be Held on June 4, 2019. This proxy statement and our 2018 annual report to stockholders, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, are available at inlandincometrust.com. We are using the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each stockholder. This allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting. On or about April 1, 2019, we will begin mailing to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and authorize your proxy online. The Notice is not a proxy and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you own shares of common stock in more than one account, such as individually and jointly with your spouse, you may have received more than one Notice. Please make sure to vote all of your shares.
You will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the Notice or on the website referred to on the Notice. Paper copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 will be furnished to you, without charge, by writing us at 2901 Butterfield Road, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523, Attention: Investor Services. If requested by stockholders, we also will provide copies of exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a reasonable fee. Table of Contents 
All of the reports, proxy materials and other information that we file with the SEC also can be inspected and copied at the Public Reference Room maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies also can be obtained by mail from the Public Reference Room at prescribed rates. Please call the SEC at (800) SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of the Public Reference Room. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC.
Information About Attending the Annual Meeting
We welcome your attendance at the annual meeting of stockholders. If you plan on attending the meeting, please contact Ms. Roberta S. Matlin, our vice president, at (800) 826-8228, so that we can arrange for sufficient space to accommodate all attendees.
Information About Voting
Holders of our common stock at the close of business on March 29, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to receive notice of and to vote their shares at the annual meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 35,590,898.927 shares of our common stock outstanding. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the meeting.
Your vote is needed to ensure that the proposals can be acted upon. Your vote is very important, even if you own a small number of shares. Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expense associated with soliciting stockholder votes.
You may vote in person or by granting us a proxy to vote on the proposals. You may authorize a proxy in any of the following ways:
If you return your proxy card but do not indicate how your shares should be voted, they will be voted "FOR" each proposal in accordance with the board's recommendation.
If you grant us a proxy, you may nevertheless revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by: (1) sending written notice to us, Attention: Ms. Roberta S. Matlin, vice president; (2) providing us with a later-dated proxy; or (3) attending the annual meeting in person and voting your shares. Merely attending the annual meeting, without further action, will not revoke your proxy. Table of Contents 
Information Regarding Tabulation of the Vote
We have hired Morrow Sodali LLC ("Morrow"), 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902, to solicit proxies on our behalf. In addition, Morrow will tabulate all votes cast at the annual meeting and will act as the inspector of election.
Quorum Requirement
The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders holding 50% or more of the shares of our common stock outstanding is necessary to constitute a "quorum." There must be a quorum present in order for the annual meeting to be a duly held meeting at which business can be conducted. If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you abstain from voting or do not give instructions for voting, then your shares will be considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Information About Vote Necessary for Action to be Taken
Proposal No. 1. With regard to the election of directors, you may vote "FOR ALL" of the nominees, you may withhold your vote for all of the nominees by voting "WITHHOLD ALL," or you may vote for all of the nominees except for certain nominee(s) by voting "FOR ALL" and striking a line through that nominee(s') name(s) or number(s) on the proxy card. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting, assuming a quorum is present, is required to elect each nominee for director. Withheld votes will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and will have the effect of a vote against each nominee for director for which authority is withheld. Broker non-votes (discussed below) will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and will have the effect of a vote against each nominee for director.
Proposal No. 2. With regard to the proposal relating to the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, you may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the proposal, or you may "ABSTAIN" from voting on the proposal. A majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, assuming a quorum is present, is required to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast; however, a properly executed proxy card marked "ABSTAIN" will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Because brokers are entitled to vote on Proposal No. 2, we do not anticipate any broker non-votes with regard to Proposal No. 2.
Broker Non-Votes
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker holding stock on behalf of a beneficial owner submits a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary power with respect to that particular proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. The election of directors is the only proposal for our stockholders' consideration at the annual meeting on which brokers do not have discretionary voting power. Thus, beneficial owners of shares held in broker accounts are advised that, if they do not timely provide instructions to their broker, their shares will not be voted in connection with the election of directors at the annual meeting.

Costs of Proxies
We will bear all costs and expenses incurred in connection with soliciting proxies. Our directors and executive officers, as well as certain employees of our business manager, IREIT Business Manager & Advisor, Inc. (sometimes referred to herein as the "Business Manager"), also may solicit proxies by mail, personal contact, letter, telephone, facsimile or other electronic means. These individuals will not receive any additional compensation for these activities, but may be reimbursed by us for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, we have hired Morrow to solicit proxies on our behalf. We will pay Morrow a fee of $5,500 plus a fee equal to $6.50 for each stockholder solicited by telephone and any out-of-pocket expenses for soliciting proxies.
Other Matters
We are not aware of any other matter to be presented at the annual meeting. Generally, no business aside from the items discussed in this proxy statement may be transacted at the meeting. If, however, any other matter properly comes before the annual meeting as determined by the chairman of the meeting, your proxies are authorized to act on the proposal at their discretion.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires each director, officer and individual beneficially owning more than 10% of our common stock to file initial statements of beneficial ownership (Form 3) and statements of changes in beneficial ownership (Forms 4 and 5) of our common stock with the SEC. Directors, officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of these forms furnished to us during, and with respect to, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, or written representations that no additional forms were required, we believe that all of our officers and directors and persons that beneficially owned more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock complied with these filing requirements during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest of Certain Persons in Matters to Be Acted On
No director, executive officer, nominee for election as a director or associate of any director, executive officer or nominee has any substantial interest, direct or indirect, through security holdings or otherwise, in any matter to be acted upon at the annual meeting. Table of Contents 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
Independence
Our business is managed under the direction and oversight of our board. The members of our board are Lee A. Daniels, Stephen L. Davis, Daniel L. Goodwin, Gwen Henry, Bernard J. Michael and Mitchell A. Sabshon. As required by our charter, a majority of our directors must be "independent." As defined by our charter, an "independent director" is a director who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with our sponsor, Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation ("IREIC" or the "Sponsor"), or the Business Manager by virtue of (1) an ownership of an interest in the Sponsor, Business Manager or any of their affiliates, (2) employment by the Sponsor, Business Manager or any of their affiliates, (3) service as an officer or director of the Sponsor, Business Manager or any of their affiliates, (4) performance of services, other than as a director, for the Company, (5) service as a director or trustee of more than three REITs sponsored by the Sponsor or managed by the Business Manager, or (6) a material business or professional relationship with the Sponsor, Business Manager or any of their affiliates. For purposes of this definition, an indirect affiliation includes circumstances in which a director's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers- or fathers-in-law, sons- or daughters-in-law or brothers- or sisters-in-law have any of the relationships identified in the immediately preceding sentence of this definition with the Company, the Sponsor, the Business Manager or any of their affiliates during the applicable two year period. For purposes of determining whether or not the business or professional relationship is material, the aggregate gross revenue derived by the person from the Company, the Sponsor, the Business Manager and their affiliates will be deemed material per se if it exceeds five percent (5.0%) of the person's: (i) annual gross revenue, derived from all sources, during either of the prior two years; or (ii) net worth, on a fair market value basis, during the prior two years.
Although our shares are not listed for trading on any national securities exchange, our board has evaluated the independence of our board members according to the director independence standard of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). The NYSE standards provide that to qualify as an independent director, among other things, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company).
After reviewing all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and the Company, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm, and considering each director's direct and indirect association with IREIC, the Business Manager or any of their affiliates, the board has determined that Messrs. Daniels, Davis and Michael and Ms. Henry qualify as independent directors. Table of Contents 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
We have separated the roles of the president and chairman of the board in recognition of the differences between the two roles. Mr. Sabshon, in his role as both our president and chief executive officer and the president and chief executive officer of the Business Manager, is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and for providing the day-to-day leadership of the Company. Mr. Goodwin, as chairman of the board, organizes the work of the board and ensures that the board has access to sufficient information to carry out its functions. Mr. Goodwin presides over meetings of the board of directors and stockholders, establishes the agenda for each meeting and oversees the distribution of information to directors.
Lee A. Daniels currently serves as our Lead Independent Director. Although each board member is kept apprised of our business and developments impacting our business, our board determined to designate a Lead Independent Director to coordinate the activities of the independent directors and serve as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the chairman of the board.
The Lead Independent Director presides at meetings when the chairman of the board is absent; establishes board meeting agendas in collaboration with the chairman of the board and the various committee chairs and recommends matters for the board and committees to consider; advises the chairman of the board as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the information submitted to the directors that is appropriate for the directors to effectively perform their duties and approves the information submitted to them; calls meetings of the independent directors or calls for executive sessions during board meetings; and presides at meetings of the independent directors or executive sessions of the board. The Lead Independent Director also performs such other responsibilities as the board may determine.
Our board believes that its Lead Independent Director structure, including the duties and responsibilities described above, provides the same independent leadership, oversight, and benefits for the Company and the board that would be provided by an independent chairman of the board. Our full board of directors, including our independent directors, is responsible for approving all material transactions, and each transaction between us and the Business Manager or its affiliates must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction. In addition, each board member is kept apprised of our business and developments impacting our business and has complete and open access to the members of our management team, the Business Manager and our real estate manager, Inland Commercial Real Estate Services LLC (our "Real Estate Manager"). Table of Contents 
Our board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company. Our board of directors oversees risk through: (1) its review and discussion of regular periodic reports to the board of directors and its committees, including management reports and studies on existing market conditions, leasing activity and property operating data, as well as actual and projected financial results, and various other matters relating to our business; (2) the required approval by the board of directors of material transactions, including, among others, acquisitions and dispositions of properties, financings and our agreements with the Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager and the ancillary service providers; (3) the oversight of our business by the audit committee; and (4) its review and discussion of regular periodic reports from our independent registered public accounting firm and other outside consultants regarding various areas of potential risk, including, among others, those relating to the qualification of the Company as a REIT for tax purposes and our internal control over financial reporting.
Communicating with Directors
Stockholders wishing to communicate with our board and the individual directors may send communications by letter, e-mail or telephone, in care of our corporate secretary, who will review and forward all correspondence to the appropriate person or persons for a response.
Our non-retaliation policy, also known as our "whistleblower" policy, prohibits us from retaliating or taking any adverse action against our employees (if we ever have employees), or the employees of the Business Manager or its affiliates, for raising a concern, including concerns about accounting, internal controls or auditing matters. Employees may raise their concerns by contacting our compliance officer at (630) 218-8000. In addition, confidential complaints involving the Company's accounting, auditing, and internal auditing controls and disclosure practices may be raised anonymously via email or mail as described in our non-retaliation policy. A complete copy of our non-retaliation policy may be found on our website at inland-investments.com/inland-income-trust under the "Corporate Governance" tab.
Committees of our Board of Directors
Audit Committee. Our board has formed a separately-designated standing audit committee, comprised of Ms. Henry and Messrs. Daniels, Davis and Michael, each of whom is an independent director. Ms. Henry serves as the chairperson of this committee, and our board has determined that Ms. Henry qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to, among other things: (1) the integrity of our financial statements; (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm; and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. The report of the committee is included in this proxy statement. Table of Contents 
Our board has adopted a written charter under which the audit committee operates. A copy of the charter is available on our website at inland-investments.com/inland-income-trust under the "Corporate Governance" tab.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our board has formed a nominating and corporate governance committee consisting of each of our independent directors, Ms. Henry and Messrs. Daniels, Davis and Michael. Mr. Daniels serves as the chairman of this committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things: (1) identifying individuals qualified to serve on the board and the nominating and corporate governance committee and recommending to the board a slate of director nominees for election by the stockholders at the annual meeting; (2) periodically reevaluating any corporate governance policies and principles adopted by the board, including recommending any amendments thereto if appropriate; and (3) overseeing an annual evaluation of the board. The nominating and corporate governance committee is also responsible for considering director nominees submitted by stockholders.
The committee considers all qualified candidates identified by members of the committee, by other members of the board of directors, by the Business Manager and by stockholders. In recommending candidates for director positions, the committee takes into account many factors and evaluates each director candidate in light of, among other things, the candidate's knowledge, experience, judgment and skills such as an understanding of the real estate industry or financial industry or accounting or financial management expertise. Other considerations include the candidate's independence from conflict with the Company, the Business Manager and the Sponsor and the ability of the candidate to devote an appropriate amount of effort to board duties. The committee also focuses on persons who are actively engaged in their occupations or professions or are otherwise regularly involved in the business, professional or academic community. A majority of our directors must be "independent," as defined in our charter. Moreover, as required by our charter, at least one of our independent directors must have at least three years of relevant real estate experience, and each director must have at least three years of relevant experience demonstrating the knowledge and experience required to successfully acquire and manage the type of assets we acquire. The committee also considers diversity in its broadest sense, including persons diverse in geography, gender and ethnicity as well as representing diverse experiences, skills and backgrounds. The committee evaluates each individual candidate by considering all of these factors as a whole, favoring active deliberation rather than the use of rigid formulas to assign relative weights to these factors.
Our board has adopted a written charter under which the nominating and corporate governance committee operates. A copy of the charter is available on our website at inland-investments.com/inland-income-trust under the "Corporate Governance" tab. Table of Contents 
Other Committees. Our board does not have a compensation committee or charter that governs the compensation process. Instead, the full board of directors performs the functions of a compensation committee, including reviewing and approving all forms of compensation for our independent directors that have been reviewed and recommended by our nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, our independent directors determine, at least annually, that the compensation that we contract to pay to the Business Manager is reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of services performed or to be performed, and is within the limits prescribed by our charter and applicable law. Our board does not believe that it requires a separate compensation committee at this time because we neither separately compensate our executive officers for their service as officers, nor do we reimburse either the Business Manager or our Real Estate Manager for any compensation paid to their employees who also serve as our executive officers.
Code of Ethics
Our board has adopted a code of ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees) which is available on our website at inland-investments.com/inland-income-trust. In addition, printed copies of the code of ethics are available to any stockholder, without charge, by writing us at 2901 Butterfield Road, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523, Attention: Investor Services.

PROPOSAL NO. 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our board has nominated the six individuals set forth below to serve as directors. Messrs. Daniels, Davis and Michael and Ms. Henry have been nominated to serve as independent directors. Messrs. Goodwin and Sabshon also have been nominated to serve as directors. The board nominated these six individuals to serve as members of the board on March 19, 2019.
If you return a proxy card but do not indicate how your shares should be voted, they will be voted "FOR" each of the nominees. We know of no reason why any nominee will be unable to serve if elected.

If any director resigns, dies or is otherwise unable to serve out his or her term, or if the board increases the number of directors, the board may fill the vacancy until the next annual meeting of stockholders.
The following sets forth each nominee's principal occupation and business, as well as the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led to the conclusion by the board that the nominee should serve as a director of the Company. All ages are stated as of January 1, 2019. As used herein, "Inland" refers to some or all of the entities that are a part of The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies, Inc., which is comprised of independent legal entities, some of which may be affiliates, share some common ownership or have been sponsored and managed by such entities or subsidiaries thereof.

[END TABLE]
We reimburse all of our directors for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in attending meetings. Each independent director may elect to receive payment of all or a portion of his or her fee in the form of unrestricted shares in lieu of cash pursuant to our employee and director restricted share plan (the "RSP") and may elect to defer the receipt of all or a portion of his or her fee pursuant to our director deferred compensation plan (the "DDCP"). We do not compensate any director that also is an employee of the Business Manager or its affiliates.
Stock Compensation
On January 16, 2018, we effected a 1-for-2.5 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock whereby every 2.5 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of our common stock (the "Reverse Stock Split"). In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, all share information presented has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. Table of Contents 
On March 21, 2016 the board of directors approved the RSP, which was subsequently approved by the Company's stockholders at the annual stockholders' meeting on June 16, 2016. The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares and restricted share units to directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees) of us, our affiliate or the Business Manager. Under the RSP, each independent director will receive an automatic award of restricted shares effective on the date of each annual stockholders' meeting (or in July, if no such meeting is held) in respect of a number of shares of common stock having a fair market value as of the date of grant equal to $10,000 or, in lieu thereof, restricted share units to the extent the independent director makes a timely deferral election in accordance with applicable law, or to the extent elected by the board. In addition to the automatic award, on June 12, 2018, each independent director received an additional award of restricted shares in respect of a number of shares of common stock having a fair market value as of the date of grant equal to $2,500 or, in lieu thereof, restricted share units to the extent the director made a deferral election with respect to his 2018 stock compensation. Restricted shares and restricted share units issued to independent directors pursuant to these grants vest over a three-year period following the respective date of grant in increments of 33-1/3% per annum, subject to their continued service as directors until each vesting date, and become fully vested earlier upon a liquidity event or upon the termination of a director by reason of his or her death or disability. The total number of common shares granted under the RSP may not exceed 5.0% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time (as such number may be adjusted to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares resulting from a stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar change in our capitalization).
Other restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of common stock from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives. Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or service as a director for any reason other than death or disability or, if applicable, the termination of the business management agreement with the Business Manager. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and may receive distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3,224 unvested restricted shares and 1,201 unvested restricted share units outstanding under the RSP. Table of Contents 
The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under the RSP as of December 31, 2018:
Deferred Compensation Plan
Effective November 9, 2016, we adopted the DDCP approved by our board that provides a deferred compensation arrangement to our independent directors and their beneficiaries. Under the DDCP, independent directors may elect to defer the receipt of all or a portion of their cash and stock compensation. Eligible cash compensation that is deferred is credited to a book entry account established for each participant in an amount equal to the amount deferred, and restricted share units are issued under the RSP in lieu of all or a portion of stock compensation otherwise payable in restricted shares. A participant has a fully vested right to his cash deferral amounts, and the deferred share unit awards will vest on the same terms and schedule as the underlying eligible stock compensation would have otherwise been subject if granted in restricted shares. Unless otherwise determined by the board, while restricted share units are unvested, participants will be credited with dividend equivalents equal in value to those declared and paid on shares of Company common stock, on all restricted share units granted to them. These dividend equivalents will be regarded as having been reinvested in restricted share units, and will only be paid to the extent the underlying restricted share units vest. Payment of restricted share units will be made, to the extent vested, in shares of Company common stock, unless otherwise determined by the board. Except as otherwise determined by the board, account balances under the DDCP will not be credited with interest or any other credits, although the Company may permit an account to be credited with earnings with respect to restricted share units.
The DDCP provides our board with the discretion to amend, suspend or terminate the DDCP at any time, provided that any amendment, suspension or termination will not be made if it would substantially impair the rights of any participant under the DDCP. Table of Contents 
Meetings of the Board of Directors, Committees and Stockholders
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our board met 16 times, the audit committee met four times and the nominating and corporate governance committee met two times. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate amount of the meetings of the board during the period for which he or she was a director, and any committee on which he or she served, in 2018.

Compensation of Executive Officers
All of our executive officers are officers of IREIC or one or more of its affiliates and are compensated by those entities, in part, for services rendered to us. We neither compensate our executive officers nor reimburse either the Business Manager or Real Estate Manager for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers, or the executive officers of the Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager or their respective affiliates; provided that, for these purposes, a corporate secretary is not considered an "executive officer." As a result, we do not have, and our board of directors has not considered, a compensation policy or program for our executive officers and has not included a "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," a report from our board of directors with respect to executive compensation, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on compensation of executives, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation or the pay ratio between employees and our principal executive officer. The fees we pay to the Business Manager and Real Estate Manager under the business management agreement or the real estate management agreement, respectively, are described in more detail under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."
In the future, our board may decide to pay annual compensation or bonuses or long-term compensation awards to one or more persons for services as officers. We also may, from time to time, grant restricted shares of our common stock to one or more of our officers. If we decide to pay our named executive officers in the future, the board of directors will review all forms of compensation and approve all stock option grants, warrants, stock appreciation rights and other current or deferred compensation payable to the executive officers with respect to the current or future value of our shares. In addition, the board will include the non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and on the frequency of stockholder votes on executive compensation in the relevant proxy statement as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act.

Table of Contents 
Business Management Agreement
We have entered into a business management agreement with IREIT Business Manager & Advisor Inc., which serves as the Business Manager with responsibility for overseeing and managing our day-to-day operations. Subject to satisfying the criteria described below, we pay the Business Manager an annual business management fee equal to 0.65% of our "average invested assets," payable quarterly in an amount equal to 0.1625% of our average invested assets as of the last day of the immediately preceding quarter; provided that the Business Manager may decide, in its sole discretion, to be paid an amount less than the total amount to which it is entitled in any particular quarter, and the excess amount that is not paid may, in the Business Manager's sole discretion, be waived permanently or deferred or accrued, without interest, to be paid at a later point in time. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Business Manager was entitled to a business management fee of approximately $9.3 million, of which approximately $2.3 million remained unpaid as of December 31, 2018.
As used herein, "average invested assets" means, for any period, the average of the aggregate book value of our assets, including all intangibles and goodwill, invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in, and loans secured by, properties, as well as amounts invested in securities and consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures or other partnerships, before reserves for amortization and depreciation or bad debts, impairments or other similar non-cash reserves, computed by taking the average of these values at the end of each month during the relevant calendar quarter.
If the business management agreement is terminated, including in connection with the internalization of the functions performed by the Business Manager, the obligation to pay this business management fee will terminate.
Prior to February 11, 2019, we were required to pay the Business Manager or its affiliates an acquisition fee equal to 1.5% of the "contract purchase price" of each real estate asset (excluding marketable securities) we acquired, including any incremental interest therein, including by way of exchanging a debt interest for an equity interest (excluding the contribution of an asset owned, directly or indirectly, by us to a joint venture) or developing, constructing, renovating, or otherwise physically improving an asset, including but not limited to major tenant upgrades, whether pursuant to allowances, concessions or rent abatements provided for at the time the asset was acquired. In the case of an asset acquired through a joint venture, the acquisition fee payable was proportionate to our ownership interest in the venture. Our business management agreement was subsequently amended to eliminate future acquisition fees and real estate sales commissions and accordingly, we do not have an obligation to pay the Business Manager these fees for transactions occurring on or after February 11, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition fees in the aggregate of approximately $28,000, all of which was paid as of December 31, 2018. Table of Contents 
For the purpose of calculating acquisition fees, the "contract purchase price" was equal to the amount of monies or other consideration paid or contributed by us either to acquire, directly or indirectly, any real estate asset or an incremental interest in the real estate asset, and including, without duplication, any indebtedness for money borrowed to finance the purchase, indebtedness secured by the real estate asset, which was assumed, or indebtedness that was refinanced or restructured, all in connection with the acquisition, and which was or was to be secured by the real estate asset at the time of the acquisition, or to develop, construct, renovate or otherwise physically improve that real estate asset. The contract purchase price excluded acquisition fees and acquisition expenses.
Prior to February 11, 2019, for substantial assistance in connection with the sale of properties, we were required to pay the Business Manager or its affiliates a real estate sales commission equal to the lesser of one-half of the customary commission which would be paid to a third party broker for the sale of a comparable property or 1% of the contract price of the property sold, provided that the amount, when added to all other real estate commissions paid to unaffiliated parties in connection with a sale, could not exceed the lesser of a competitive real estate commission or 3% of the sales price of the property. Our business management agreement was subsequently amended to eliminate real estate sales commissions. We did not sell any properties, and thus did not incur any real estate sales commissions, during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Upon a "triggering event," we will pay the Business Manager a subordinated incentive fee equal to 10% of the amount by which (1) the "liquidity amount" (as defined below) exceeds (2) the "aggregate invested capital," plus the total distributions required to be paid to our stockholders in order to pay them a 7% per annum cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded return on the aggregate invested capital, all measured as of the triggering event. If we have not satisfied this return threshold at the time of the applicable triggering event, the fee will be paid at the time of any future triggering event, provided that we have satisfied the return requirements. We did not experience a "triggering event," and thus did not incur a subordinated incentive fee, during the year ended December 31, 2018.
As used herein, a "triggering event" means any sale of assets (excluding the sale of marketable securities) in which the net sales proceeds are specifically identified and distributed to our stockholders, or any liquidity event, such as a listing or any merger, reorganization, business combination, share exchange or acquisition, in which our stockholders receive cash or the securities of another issuer that are listed on a national securities exchange. "Aggregate invested capital" means the aggregate original issue price paid for the shares of our common stock, before reduction for organization and offering expenses, reduced by any distribution of sale or financing proceeds. Table of Contents 
For purposes of this subordinated incentive fee, the "liquidity amount" will be calculated as follows:
If the business management agreement is terminated pursuant to an internalization in accordance with the transition process set forth in that agreement, the Business Manager, or its successor or designee, will continue to be entitled to receive the subordinated incentive fee, on a prorated basis based on the duration of the Business Manager's service to us. Specifically, in this case, the Business Manager, or its successor or designee, will be entitled to a fee equal to the product of: (1) the amount of the fee to which the Business Manager otherwise would have been entitled had the agreement not been terminated; and (2) the quotient of the number of days elapsed from the effective date of the agreement through the closing of the internalization, and the number of days elapsed from the effective date of the agreement through the date of the closing of the applicable triggering event.

Real Estate Management Agreement
We have entered into a real estate management agreement with our Real Estate Manager under which our Real Estate Manager and its affiliates manage or oversee each of our real properties. For each property that is managed directly by our Real Estate Manager or its affiliates, we pay the Real Estate Manager a monthly management fee of up to 1.9% of the gross income from any single-tenant, net-leased property, and up to 3.9% of the gross income from any other type of property. The Real Estate Manager determines, in its sole discretion, the amount of the management fee payable in connection with a particular property, subject to these limits. For each property that is managed directly by the Real Estate Manager or its affiliates, we pay the Real Estate Manager a separate leasing fee based upon prevailing market rates applicable to the geographic market of that property. If we engage our Real Estate Manager to provide construction management services for a property, we also pay a separate construction management fee based upon prevailing market rates applicable to the geographic market of that property. We also reimburse our Real Estate Manager and its affiliates for property-level expenses that they pay or incur on our behalf, including the salaries, bonuses and benefits of persons performing services for our Real Estate Manager and its affiliates (excluding the executive officers of our Real Estate Manager). For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred real estate management fees, construction management fees and leasing fees in an aggregate amount equal to approximately $6.5 million, of which approximately $43,000 remained unpaid as of December 31, 2018.
Other Fees and Expense Reimbursements
We reimburse the Business Manager, Real Estate Manager and entities affiliated with each of them, such as Inland Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC ("IREA"), Inland Institutional Capital, LLC and their respective affiliates, as well as third parties, for any investment-related expenses they pay in connection with selecting, evaluating or acquiring any investment in real estate assets, regardless of whether we acquire a particular real estate asset, subject to the limits in our charter. Examples of reimbursable expenses include but are not limited to legal fees and expenses, travel and communications expenses, costs of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses, third-party broker or finder's fees, title insurance expenses, survey expenses, property inspection expenses and other closing costs. We do not reimburse acquisition expenses in connection with an investment in marketable securities, except that we may reimburse expenses incurred on our behalf and payable to a third party, such as third-party brokerage commissions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $8,000 in acquisition expenses, all of which was paid as of December 31, 2018. Table of Contents 
We reimburse IREIC, the Business Manager and their respective affiliates, including the service providers, for any expenses that they pay or incur on our behalf in providing services to us, including all expenses and the costs of salaries and benefits of persons performing services for these entities on our behalf (except for the salaries and benefits of persons who also serve as one of our executive officers or as an executive officer of the Business Manager or its affiliates) and expenses ultimately paid to third parties. Expenses include, but are not limited to: expenses incurred in connection with any sale of assets or any contribution of assets to a joint venture; expenses incurred in connection with any liquidity event; taxes and assessments on income or real property and taxes; premiums and other associated fees for insurance policies including director and officer liability insurance; expenses associated with investor communications including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing annual reports, proxy statements and other reports required by governmental entities; administrative service expenses charged to, or for the benefit of, us by third parties; audit, accounting and legal fees charged to, or for the benefit of, us by third parties; transfer agent and registrar's fees and charges paid to third parties; and expenses relating to any offices or office facilities maintained solely for our benefit that are separate and distinct from our executive offices. During the year ended December 31, 2018, IREIC, the Business Manager and their respective affiliates incurred on our behalf approximately $1.5 million of these expenses, of which approximately $0.2 million had not been reimbursed by us as of December 31, 2018.
Policies and Procedures with Respect to Related Party Transactions
We have adopted a conflicts of interest policy, which prohibits us from engaging in the following types of transactions with IREIC-affiliated entities:
This policy does not impact agreements or relationships between us and IREIC and its affiliates, including, for example, agreements with the Business Manager and Real Estate Manager.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
We have no employees and do not compensate our executive officers. See the discussion under "Compensation of Executive Officers" above for additional detail regarding compensation and the discussion under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" above for disclosures called for by Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following Audit Committee Report does not constitute "soliciting material" and should not be deemed "filed" with the SEC or incorporated by reference into any other filing we make under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this Report by reference therein.
The Company's management is responsible for the financial reporting process, preparing consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), and designing and implementing a system of internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with GAAP and applicable laws and regulations. Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing our year-end financial statements. The audit committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing these procedures and processes. The audit committee is comprised of four independent directors whose independence has been determined by the board of directors based on the standards set forth in the audit committee's charter. The board has determined that Ms. Henry qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The members of the audit committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing, and do not provide any expert or other special assurance as to our financial statements concerning compliance with laws, regulations or GAAP or as to the independence of the registered public accounting firm. The audit committee relies in part, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the audit committee met four times. At these meetings, the members of the audit committee met with representatives of the Company's management and with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP. The committee discussed numerous items at these meetings including KPMG's responsibilities to the Company and its audit plan for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The audit committee also has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's management. Management has advised the committee that the financial statements reviewed have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and reviewed significant accounting and disclosure issues with the committee.
The audit committee also discussed with KPMG all of the matters required by generally accepted auditing standards, including the matters required to be discussed by the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The audit committee obtained a formal written statement from KPMG, describing all relationships between KPMG and the Company that might bear on KPMG's independence. In addition, the audit committee discussed any relationships that may have an impact on KPMG's objectivity and independence and reviewed audit and non-audit fees paid to KPMG and the written disclosures and letter from KPMG to the committee, as required by the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. The audit committee has concluded that KPMG is independent from the Company. Table of Contents 
Based on the review and discussions with management and KPMG described above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 – RATIFY SELECTION OF KPMG LLP
The audit committee has selected KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although ratification is not required by our charter, our bylaws or otherwise, our board is submitting the selection of KPMG to our stockholders for ratification because we value our stockholders' views on our independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate practice. The audit committee will consider the outcome of this vote in its decision to appoint an independent registered public accounting firm but is not bound by our stockholders' vote. Even if the selection of KPMG is ratified, the audit committee may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. If you return a proxy card but do not indicate how your shares should be voted, they will be voted "FOR" the appointment of KPMG.
Representatives of KPMG will attend the annual meeting. These representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD: The board recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audit of our annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, together with fees for audit-related services and tax services rendered by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Approval of Services and Fees
Our audit committee has reviewed and approved all of the fees charged by KPMG, and actively monitors the relationship between audit and non-audit services provided by KPMG. The audit committee concluded that all services rendered by KPMG during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were consistent with maintaining KPMG's independence. Accordingly, the audit committee has approved all of the services provided by KPMG. As a matter of policy, the Company will not engage its primary independent registered public accounting firm for non-audit services other than "audit-related services," as defined by the SEC, certain tax services and other permissible non-audit services except as specifically approved by the chairperson of the audit committee and presented to the full committee at its next regular meeting. The Company also follows limits on hiring partners of, and other professionals employed by, KPMG to ensure that the SEC's auditor independence rules are satisfied.
The audit committee must pre-approve any engagements to render services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and the fees charged for these services including an annual review of audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and other fees with specific dollar value limits for each category of service. During the year, the audit committee will periodically monitor the levels of fees charged by KPMG and compare these fees to the amounts previously approved. The audit committee also will consider on a case-by-case basis and, if appropriate, approve specific engagements that are not otherwise pre-approved. Any proposed engagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-approved service may be presented to the chairperson of the audit committee for approval. Table of Contents
