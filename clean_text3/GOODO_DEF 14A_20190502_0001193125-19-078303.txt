To the Stockholders of Gladstone Commercial Corporation: 
We are notifying you that the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Gladstone Commercial Corporation will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. EDT. The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be a completely "virtual meeting." You will be able to attend the meeting as well as vote and submit your questions during the live webcast of the meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GOOD2019 and entering the company number and control number included in your "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials" on your proxy card or in the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. Your virtual attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting affords you the same rights and opportunities to participate as you would have at an in-person annual meeting. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  To elect three directors to hold office for terms that will expire at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and when their respective  successors are duly elected and qualify;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  To ratify the Audit Committee's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our  fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  To transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
The foregoing items of business are more fully described in the Proxy Statement accompanying this Notice. 
The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 4, 2019, as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to our stockholders a "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials," which contains instructions on how stockholders can access those documents over the Internet and vote their shares. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how stockholders can receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement, our 2018 Annual Report, and a proxy card or voting instruction card. We believe this process will expedite stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs of our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and conserve natural resources.

PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held On May 2, 2019 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING 
What is the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and why am I receiving it? 
Pursuant to the "e-proxy" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), Gladstone Commercial Corporation, referred to herein as "we," us," the "Company" or "Gladstone Commercial," is providing access to our proxy materials in a fast and efficient manner via the Internet. Accordingly, on March 18, 2019, we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2019, and posted our proxy materials on the website referenced in the Notice (www.proxyvote.com). As more fully described in the Notice, all stockholders may choose to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice. In addition, the Notice and website provide information regarding how you may elect to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. If you previously elected to receive a printed or electronic copy of our proxy materials, which we also expect to distribute on or about March 18, 2019, you will continue to receive these materials by mail or electronic mail, as applicable. You will continue to receive paper or electronic copies of our proxy materials in the future until you elect otherwise. 
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 4, 2019, will be entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). On this record date, there were 30,352,399 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, having one vote per share. 
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name 
If at the close of business on March 4, 2019, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc., then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote at the meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares by mail, over the telephone or on the Internet. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares by following the instructions in the Notice or in this proxy statement to ensure that your vote is counted. 
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank 
If at the close of business on March 4, 2019, your shares were held not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization (collectively, a "Brokerage Firm"), then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and the Notice is being forwarded to you by that Brokerage Firm, which is the actual stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your Brokerage Firm as to how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting via webcast. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your Brokerage Firm.  What am I voting on? 
There are two matters scheduled for a vote, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1, to elect three directors to hold office for terms that will expire at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and when their  respective successors are duly elected and qualify; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2, to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public  accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote? 
For Proposal 1, you may either vote "FOR" all the nominees to the Board of Directors (the "Board") or you may "WITHHOLD" your vote for any nominee you specify. For Proposal 2, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting. The procedures for voting are set forth below: 
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote at the Annual Meeting or authorize a proxy to vote your shares over the telephone, on the Internet, or by using a proxy card that you may request or that we may elect to deliver at a later time. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares using one of the methods listed below to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting via webcast and vote even if you have already submitted a proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote virtually during the live webcast of the Annual Meeting, please follow the instructions for attending and voting at the Annual Meeting posted  at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GOOD2019. You will need the company number and control number included in the Notice sent to you or, if you requested printed copies be sent to you by mail, on your proxy card or in the instructions that  accompanied your proxy materials. All votes must be received by the inspectors of election appointed for the meeting before the polls close at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To authorize a proxy to vote your shares using a proxy card, simply complete, sign and date the proxy card that may be delivered and return it promptly  in the envelope provided. To request a proxy card, follow the instructions on the Notice. If you return your signed proxy card to us before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To authorize a proxy to vote over the telephone, dial toll-free 1-800-690-6903 using a touch-tone phone and follow the recorded instructions. You will be asked to provide the company number and control number from the Notice. Your vote must be received by  11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 1, 2019, the day prior to the Annual Meeting, to be counted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To authorize a proxy to vote on the Internet, follow the instructions in the Notice or go to www.proxyvote.com to complete an electronic proxy  card. You will be asked to provide the company number and control number from the Notice. Your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 1, 2019, the day prior to the Annual Meeting, to be counted.   
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Your Broker or Bank 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your Brokerage Firm, you should have received a notice containing voting instructions from that organization rather than from Gladstone Commercial.   Simply follow the voting instructions in the notice to ensure that your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may authorize a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or over the Internet as instructed by your Brokerage Firm. To vote virtually during the live webcast of the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your Brokerage Firm. Follow the instructions from your Brokerage Firm or contact them to request a proxy form. 
We provide Internet proxy voting to allow you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares online, with procedures designed to ensure the authenticity and correctness of your proxy vote instructions. However, please be aware that you must bear any costs associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges from your Internet access provider and telephone company. 
What if another matter is properly brought before the meeting? 
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your Proxy Card) will vote on those matters in accordance with their discretion. 
How many votes do I have? 
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of common stock you owned as of the close of business on March 4, 2019. 
What if I return a proxy card or otherwise vote but do not make specific choices? 
If you return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise vote without marking voting selections, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of all director nominees and "FOR" the ratification of the Audit Committee's selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. If any other matter is properly presented at the meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his or her discretion. 
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
We, Gladstone Commercial Corporation, will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of the Notice, and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of our common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of our common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other employees of Gladstone Management Corporation (our "Adviser"), or Gladstone Administration, LLC (our "Administrator"). No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other employees for such services. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice? 
If you receive more than one Notice, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts at your Brokerage Firm. Please follow the voting instructions on all such Notices to ensure that all of your shares have been voted.  Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy? 
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may grant a subsequent proxy through the Internet.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may grant a subsequent proxy by telephone on a later date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may send a timely written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Gladstone Commercial Corporation's corporate secretary at  1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite 100, McLean, Virginia 22102.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote virtually during the live webcast. However, simply attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your  proxy.  
[END TABLE]
Your most current proxy card, Internet proxy or telephone vote is the one that is counted. If your shares are held by your Brokerage Firm, you should follow the instructions provided by them. 
When are stockholder proposals due for next year's Annual Meeting? 
We will consider for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders proposals that we receive not later than November 19, 2019, and that comply with all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and our bylaws, as amended ("Bylaws"). Stockholders must submit their proposals to our corporate secretary at 1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite 100, McLean, Virginia 22102. 
In addition, any stockholder who wishes to propose a nominee to the Board or propose any other business to be considered by the stockholders (other than a stockholder proposal to be included in our proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act) must comply with the advance notice provisions and other requirements of Article II, Section 4 of our Bylaws, a copy of which is on file with the SEC and may be obtained from our corporate secretary upon request. These notice provisions require that nominations of persons for election to the Board and proposals of business to be considered by the stockholders for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be made in writing and submitted to our corporate secretary at the address above no earlier than February 2, 2020 (90 days before the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders) and not later than March 3, 2020 (60 days before the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders). You are also advised to review our Bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. 
What is the quorum requirement? 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting of stockholders. A quorum will be present if at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares are represented by stockholders present at the meeting or by proxy. On the record date, there were 30,352,399 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Thus, 15,176,200 shares must be represented by stockholders present at the meeting or by proxy to have a quorum. 
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your Brokerage Firm or other nominee) or if you vote virtually during the meeting.   "WITHHOLD" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the holders of a majority of the voting shares present at the meeting or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting to another date. 
How are votes counted? 
Votes will be counted by the inspectors of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately count: (i) "FOR" and "WITHHOLD" votes and broker non-votes for Proposal 1 (election of directors) and (ii) "FOR," "AGAINST" and "ABSTAIN" votes with respect to Proposal 2 (ratification of the appointment of PwC). "WITHHOLD" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect with regard to Proposals 1 and 2, although they will be considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Our chief financial officer, Mike Sodo, and our general counsel and secretary, Michael LiCalsi, have been appointed as the inspectors of election. 
What are "broker non-votes"? 
Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to his or her Brokerage Firm holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed "non-routine." Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting instructions to the Brokerage Firm holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the Brokerage Firm can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters. 
Under rules of the New York Stock Exchange that are applicable to the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"), Proposal 1 (election of directors) is a non-routine proposal; thus your Brokerage Firm is not entitled to vote your shares without your instructions. Proposal 2 (ratification of the appointment of PwC) is a routine proposal; thus your Brokerage Firm may vote your shares even if it does not receive instructions from you. In the event that a Brokerage Firm indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a non-routine proposal, then those shares will be treated as broker non-votes. 
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal? 
For Proposal 1, the vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary for the election of a director. Therefore, for the three directorships to be filled at the Annual Meeting, the three nominees receiving the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast virtually during the meeting or by proxy) will be elected. "WITHHOLD" and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. However, they will be counted towards the quorum requirement. 
For Proposal 2, the ratification of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm, the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting at which a quorum is present is required to approve the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. However, they will be counted toward the quorum requirement.  How can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting? 
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Final results will be announced in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC within four business days after the conclusion of the Annual Meeting.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS TO CLASS OF 2022 
Our Board is divided into three classes. Each class has a three-year term. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only by persons elected by a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected by the Board to fill a vacancy in a class, including any vacancies created by an increase in the number of directors, shall serve for the remainder of the full term of that class and until the director's successor is elected and qualified. Our Board currently has eight directorships and eight members. 
There are three directors in the class whose term of office expires in 2019. Therefore, the Board has nominated three persons for election to the class whose term of office will expire in 2022. Each nominee is a current member of our Board. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. If elected at the Annual Meeting, each nominee would serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting and until his successor is elected and has qualified, or, if sooner, until his death, resignation or removal. It is our policy to encourage directors and nominees for director to attend the Annual Meeting. None of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Directors are elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, for the three directorships to be filled at the Annual Meeting, the three nominees receiving the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected. "WITHHOLD" votes and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the three nominees named below. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, your shares will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee proposed by our management. Each person nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected. Our management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve. 
Nominees for Election for a Three-year Term, Expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
The following is a brief biography of each director nominee.

He is a retired Navy Captain. Mr. Adelgren holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a BA from the University of Kansas.

INFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Independence of the Board of Directors 
As required under Nasdaq listing standards, a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors must qualify as "independent," as affirmatively determined by the board of directors. The Board consults with our chief compliance officer and legal counsel to ensure that the Board's determinations are consistent with relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of "independent," including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of Nasdaq, as in effect from time to time. 
Consistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and us, our senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board has affirmatively determined that the following six current directors are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards: Messrs. Adelgren, Outland, Parker and Wilkinson and Mses. English and Merrick. Mr. Gladstone, the chairman of our Board and our chief executive officer and Mr. Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer are not independent directors by virtue of their positions as our executive officers. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors 
The Board met four times during the last fiscal year. Each then current Board member attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which he or she served that were held during the period for which he or she was a director or committee member. 
As required under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, which require regularly scheduled meetings of independent directors, in fiscal year 2018, our independent directors met four times in regularly scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors were present. 
Corporate Leadership Structure 
Since our inception, Mr. Gladstone has served as chairman of our Board and our chief executive officer. The Board believes that our chief executive officer is best situated to serve as chairman because he is the director most familiar with our business and industry, and most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities and leading the discussion and execution of strategy. In addition, Mr. Adelgren, one of our independent directors, serves as the Lead Director for all meetings of our independent directors held in executive session. The Lead Director has the responsibility of presiding at all executive sessions of the Board, consulting with the chairman and chief executive officer on Board and committee meeting agendas, acting as a liaison between management and the independent directors and facilitating teamwork and communication between the independent directors and management. 
The Board believes the combined role of chairman and chief executive officer, together with having an independent Lead Director, is in the best interests of us and our stockholders because it provides the appropriate balance between strategic development and independent oversight of management.  Our Board has six committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, an Executive Committee, an Offering Committee, an Ethics, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Valuation Committee. The following table shows the current composition of each of the committees of the Board:

Below is a description of each committee of the Board. All committees have the authority to engage legal counsel or other experts or consultants, as they deem appropriate to carry out their responsibilities. 
The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee of the Board oversees our corporate accounting and financial reporting process. For this purpose, the Audit Committee performs several functions. The Audit Committee evaluates the performance of and assesses the qualifications of the independent registered public accounting firm; determines and approves the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm; determines whether to retain or terminate the existing independent registered public accounting firm or to appoint and engage a new independent registered public accounting firm; reviews and approves the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform any proposed permissible non-audit services; monitors the rotation of partners of the independent registered public accounting firm on our audit engagement team as required by law; confers with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting; establishes procedures, as required under applicable law, for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential and anonymous submission by employees of the Adviser or the Administrator regarding concerns of questionable accounting or auditing matters; and meets to review our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including reviewing our disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee was comprised of Messrs. Parker (Chairperson) and Outland and Mses. English and Merrick. Messrs. Adelgren and Wilkinson currently serve as alternate members of the Audit Committee. Alternate members of the Audit Committee serve and participate in meetings of the Audit Committee only in the event of an absence of a regular member of the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee has adopted a written charter that is available to stockholders in the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.GladstoneCommercial.com. Information from our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement.  The Board reviews the Nasdaq listing standards definition of independence for Audit Committee members on an annual basis and has determined that each of Messrs. Parker, Outland, Adelgren (alternate) and Wilkinson (alternate) and Mses. English and Merrick is an independent director (as currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing standards). No members of the Audit Committee received any compensation from us during the last fiscal year other than directors' fees. The Board has also determined that each of Messrs. Parker, Outland, Adelgren (alternate) and Wilkinson (alternate) and Mses. English and Merrick qualify as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in applicable SEC rules. The Board made a qualitative assessment of the members' level of knowledge and experience based on a number of factors, including formal education and experience. The Board has also unanimously determined that all Audit Committee members and alternate members are financially literate under current Nasdaq rules and listing standards. In addition to our Audit Committee, Messrs. Parker and Outland and Mses. English and Merrick also serve on the audit committees of Gladstone Investment, Gladstone Capital and Gladstone Land. Our Audit Committee's alternate members, Messrs. Adelgren and Wilkinson, also serve as alternate members on the audit committees of Gladstone Investment, Gladstone Capital and Gladstone Land. The Board has affirmatively determined that this simultaneous service does not impair the respective directors' ability to effectively and independently serve on our Audit Committee. 
The Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which is available to stockholders and can be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.GladstoneCommercial.com, and conducts periodic reviews of the investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with our Adviser and the administration agreement (the "Administration Agreement") with our Administrator, to evaluate whether the fees paid to the parties under the respective agreements are in the best interests of us and our stockholders. The committee considers in such periodic reviews, among other things, whether the performance of our Adviser and our Administrator are reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of services performed, and whether the provisions of the Advisory and Administration Agreements are being satisfactorily performed. The Compensation Committee also reviews and considers all incentive fees payable to our Adviser under the Advisory Agreement. The Compensation Committee also reviews with management our Compensation Discussion and Analysis to be included in proxy statements and other filings. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews, approves and recommends to our Board the compensation of our non-employee directors. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee was comprised of Messrs. Outland (Chairperson), Adelgren and Wilkinson. Mr. Parker and Mses. English and Merrick currently serve as alternate members of the Compensation Committee.

Our Compensation Committee's current alternate members, Mr. Parker and Mses. English and Merrick also serve as alternate members on the compensation committees of Gladstone Capital, Gladstone Land and Gladstone Investment. Our Board has determined that this simultaneous service does not impair the respective directors' ability to effectively serve on our Compensation Committee.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During the last completed fiscal year, the Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Outland (Chairperson), Adelgren and Wilkinson. Mr. Parker and Mses. English and Merrick currently serve as alternate members of the Compensation Committee. None of the aforementioned persons is or has been one of our officers or employees.

The Ethics, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Ethics, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Ethics Committee") of the Board is responsible for identifying, reviewing and evaluating candidates to serve as our directors (consistent with criteria approved by the Board), reviewing and evaluating incumbent directors, recommending to the Board for selection candidates for election to the Board, making recommendations to the Board regarding the membership of the committees of the Board, assessing the performance of the Board and developing our corporate governance principles. Our Ethics Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which is available to stockholders and can be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.GladstoneCommercial.com. During the last fiscal year, the Ethics Committee was comprised of Messrs. Adelgren (Chairperson), Outland and Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Parker and Mses. English and Merrick served as alternate members of the Committee during fiscal year 2018. Alternate members of the committee serve and participate in meetings of the committee only in the event of an absence of a regular member of the committee. Each member and alternate member of the Ethics Committee is an independent director (as currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing standards). The Ethics Committee met four times during the last fiscal year. 
Information Regarding the Process for Nominating Director Candidates 
The Ethics Committee believes that candidates for director should have certain minimum qualifications, including being able to read and understand basic financial statements, being over 21 years of age and having the highest personal integrity and ethics. The Ethics Committee also intends to consider such factors including, but not limited to, relevant expertise and ability to offer advice and guidance to management, ability to devote sufficient time to our affairs, demonstrated excellence in his or her field, ability to exercise sound business judgment and commitment to rigorously represent the long-term interests of our stockholders. However, the Ethics Committee retains the right to modify these qualifications from time to time. Candidates for director nominees are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board, our operating requirements and the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
Though we have no formal policy addressing diversity, the Ethics Committee and Board believes that diversity is an important attribute of directors and that our directors should represent an array of backgrounds and experiences and should be capable of articulating a variety of viewpoints. Accordingly, the Ethics Committee considers in its review of director nominees factors such as values, disciplines, ethics, age, gender, race, culture, expertise, background and skills, all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of us and our Board at that point in time in order to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. 
In the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Ethics Committee reviews such directors' overall service to us during their term, including the number of meetings attended, level of   participation, quality of performance and any other relationships and transactions that might impair such directors' independence. In the case of new director candidates, the Ethics Committee also determines whether such new nominee must be independent for Nasdaq purposes, based upon applicable Nasdaq listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice of counsel, if necessary. The Ethics Committee then uses its network of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The Ethics Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board. The Ethics Committee meets to discuss and consider such candidates' qualifications and then selects a nominee for recommendation to the Board by majority vote. To date, the Ethics Committee has not paid a fee to any third party to assist in the process of identifying or evaluating director candidates. 
Stockholder Recommendations of Director Candidates to the Ethics, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Ethics Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. The Ethics Committee does not alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a stockholder or not. Stockholders who wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Ethics Committee to become nominees for election to the Board may do so by timely delivering a written recommendation to the Ethics Committee at the address set forth on the cover page of this proxy statement containing the information required by our Bylaws. For nominations for election to the Board or other business to be properly brought before an Annual Meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must comply with the advance notice provisions and other requirements of Article II, Section 4(B) of our Bylaws. These notice provisions require that nominations for directors must be received no earlier than February 2, 2020 (90 days before the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders) and no later than March 2, 2020 (60 days before the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders). In the event that an annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting date and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

PROPOSAL 2 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board has selected PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm, which will audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and has further directed that management submit the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.

Neither our Bylaws nor other governing documents or law require stockholder ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Audit Committee is submitting the selection of PwC to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the selection of PwC. Abstentions will be considered present and entitled to vote for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists, although they will not be counted for any purpose in determining whether this matter has been approved. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees 
The following table represents the amount and type of fees capitalized or expensed by us for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 that were charged by PwC, our principal independent registered public accounting firm.

[END TABLE]
In the above table, in accordance with the SEC's definitions and rules, "audit fees" are fees for professional services for the audit of a company's financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K, for the review of a company's financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and for services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. All fees described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the policies and procedures described below.  Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm, PwC. Pursuant to the policy specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts are generally pre-approved; however, there were no such services provided by PwC in the last two fiscal years. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committee's approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm or on an individual explicit case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Audit Committee's members, but the decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of the services other than audit services by PwC, if any, when incurred, is compatible with maintaining the principal independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 2.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements with management and PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present. The Audit Committee included in its review results of the independent registered public accounting firm's examinations, our internal controls, and the quality of our financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed our procedures and internal control processes designed to ensure full, fair and adequate financial reporting and disclosures, including procedures for certifications by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer that are required in periodic reports filed by us with the SEC. The Audit Committee further reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm their opinion on our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee is satisfied that our internal control system is adequate and that we employ appropriate accounting and auditing procedures. 
Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees) as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which addresses communication between audit committees and independent registered public accounting firms. The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by PCAOB Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with PwC our critical accounting policies and practices, internal controls, other material written communications to management, and the scope of PwC's audits and all fees paid to PwC during the fiscal year. The Audit Committee adopted guidelines requiring review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services performed by PwC. The Audit Committee has reviewed and considered the compatibility of PwC's performance of non-audit services with the maintenance of PwC's independence as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that our audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. In addition, the Audit Committee has engaged PwC to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
None of our executive officers receive direct compensation from us. We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. The services necessary for the operation of our business are provided to us by our officers and the other employees of our Adviser and Administrator, pursuant to the terms of the Advisory and Administration Agreements, respectively. Mr. Gladstone, our chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Brubaker, our vice chairman and chief operating officer, and Mr. Cutlip, our president, are all employees of and compensated directly by our Adviser. Mr. Sodo, our chief financial officer, and Mr. Beckhorn, our treasurer, are employees of our Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, we reimburse our Administrator for our allocable portion of the chief financial officer and treasurers' compensation. During our last fiscal year, our allocable portion of Mr. Sodo's compensation paid by our Administrator was approximately $73,064 of his salary, $42,630 of his bonus, and $5,661 of the cost of his benefits. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred total fees of approximately $8.1 million to our Adviser under the Advisory Agreement and $1.6 million to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement. For a discussion of the terms of our Advisory and Administration Agreements, see "Transactions With Related Persons."

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Advisory and Administration Agreements 
Under the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is responsible for our daily operations of managing the investment and reinvestment of our assets. Specifically, these responsibilities include (i) identifying, evaluating, negotiating and consummating all investment transactions consistent with our investment objectives and criteria; (ii) providing us with all required records and regular reports to our Board concerning our Adviser's efforts on our behalf; and (iii) maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to us. The Advisory Agreement provides for an annual base management fee equal to 1.5% of our adjusted total stockholders' equity, which is our total stockholders' equity (before giving effect to the base management fee and incentive fee), adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses that do not affect realized net income (including impairment charges) and adjusted for any one-time events and certain non-cash items (the later to occur for a given quarter only upon the approval of our Compensation Committee). The fee is calculated and accrued quarterly as 0.375% per quarter of such adjusted total stockholders' equity figure. The definition of adjusted total stockholders' equity in the calculation of the base management fee and the incentive fee (described below) includes total mezzanine equity and outstanding common units of limited partnership interest in Gladstone Commercial Limited Partnership ("Operating Partnership") issued to non-controlling Operating Partnership Unitholders. The Advisory Agreement also rewards our Adviser with an incentive fee when our quarterly Core FFO (defined at the end of this paragraph), before giving effect to any incentive fee, or pre-incentive fee Core FFO, exceeds 2.0% quarterly, or 8.0% annualized, of adjusted total stockholders' equity (after giving effect to the base management fee but before giving effect to the incentive fee). We refer to this as the hurdle amount. The Adviser will receive 15.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee Core FFO that exceeds the hurdle amount. However, in no event shall the incentive fee for a particular quarter exceed by 15.0% (the cap) the average quarterly incentive fee paid by us for the previous four quarters (excluding quarters for which no incentive fee was paid). Core FFO (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) available to common stockholders, excluding the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization, any realized and unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) available to common stockholders for the period, and one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP.  Our Adviser has the ability to issue a full or partial waiver of the incentive fee and may do so to maintain the current level of distributions to our stockholders. Any such waiver is subject to the approval of our Board. The Adviser did not waive any portion of the fee for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Further, the Advisory Agreement provides for a capital gains-based incentive that will be determined by calculating aggregate realized capital gains and aggregate realized capital losses for the applicable time period. For this purpose, aggregate realized capital gains and losses, if any, equals the realized gain or loss calculated by the difference between the sales price of the property (based on the all-in acquisition cost of disposed properties), less any costs to sell the property and the current gross value of the property (which is calculated as the original acquisition price plus any subsequent non-reimbursed capital improvements). At the end of the respective fiscal year, if this number is positive, then the capital gain fee payable for such time period shall equal 15.0% of such amount. No capital gain fee was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 
Additionally, the Advisory Agreement includes a termination fee whereby, in the event of our termination of the agreement without cause (with 120 days' prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), a termination fee would be payable to the Adviser equal to two times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by the Adviser during the 24-month period prior to such termination. A termination fee is also payable if the Adviser terminates the agreement after the Company has defaulted and applicable cure periods have expired. The agreement may also be terminated for cause by us (with 30 days' prior written notice and the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors), with no termination fee payable. Cause is defined in the agreement to include if the Adviser breaches any material provisions of the agreement, the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Adviser, dissolution of the Adviser and fraud or misappropriation of funds. 
Under the Administration Agreement, we pay separately for administrative services including record keeping and regulatory compliance functions. Payments under the Advisory Agreement are generally equal to our allocable portion of our Administrator's overhead expenses in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent for the space occupied by our Administrator, and our allocable portion of the salaries, bonuses, and benefits expenses of our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary and their respective staffs. Our allocable portion of the Administrator's expenses are generally derived by multiplying our Administrator's total expenses by the approximate amount of time the Administrator's employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under contractual agreements. 
Each of David Gladstone and Terry L. Brubaker serve as an executive officer and director of ours and of each of our Adviser and our Administrator. Robert Cutlip, our president, is employed by our Adviser as an executive managing director. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary, also has served as the president of the Administrator since July 2013 and as general counsel and secretary of each of the Adviser and Administrator since 2009 and 2012, respectively. He has also served as chief legal officer and a managing principal of Gladstone Securities since 2010. Mike Sodo, our chief financial officer is an employee of the Administrator. Our treasurer, Jay Beckhorn is an employee of our Administrator and is also the treasurer of Gladstone Land and a registered representative of Gladstone Securities that assists in procuring mortgage financing for our properties as discussed below in "Mortgage Financing Arrangement Agreement." David Gladstone is the indirect controlling stockholder of each of our Adviser and Administrator. Although we believe that the terms of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement are no less favorable to us than those that could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties in arms' length transactions, our Adviser and Administrator, their officers and their directors have a material interest in the terms of these agreements.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred total fees of approximately $8.1 million to our Adviser under the Advisory Agreement and $1.6 million to our Administrator under the Administration Agreement. 
Mortgage Financing Arrangement Agreement 
Gladstone Securities, an affiliated broker dealer which is 100% indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone, provides mortgage financing services to us under a contractual agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, effective June 18, 2013, Gladstone Securities acts as our non-exclusive agent to assist us with arranging mortgage financing for properties we own. In connection with this engagement, Gladstone Securities may from time to time solicit the interest of various commercial real estate lenders or recommend to us third party lenders offering credit products or packages that are responsive to our needs. We pay Gladstone Securities a financing fee in connection with the services it provides to us for securing mortgage financing on any of our properties. The amount of these financing fees, which are payable upon closing of the financing, are based on a percentage of the amount of the mortgage, generally ranging from 0.15% to a maximum of 1.0% of the mortgage obtained. The amount of the financing fees may be reduced or eliminated, as determined by us and Gladstone Securities, after taking into consideration various factors, including, but not limited to, the involvement of any third party brokers and market conditions. Messrs. Gladstone, LiCalsi and Dellafiora serve on the board of managers of Gladstone Securities. Our Board reviews, approves and ratifies these fees each quarter. We paid financing fees of $0.2 million and $0.1 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, or 0.24% and 0.11% of total mortgages secured or extended, respectively. 
Conflict of Interest Policy 
We have adopted policies to reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, our directors are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law that are designed to minimize conflicts. Under our current conflict of interest policy, without the approval of a majority of disinterested directors, we will not: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• acquire from or sell to any of our officers, directors or employees of our Adviser or our Administrator, or any entity in which any of our officers,  directors or such employee has an interest of more than 5%, any assets or other property;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• make any loan to or borrow from any of our directors, officers or employees of our Adviser or our Administrator, or any entity, in which any of our  officers, directors or such employee has an interest of more than 5%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• grant warrants or options to purchase our stock to any of our directors, officers or employees of our Adviser or our Administrator, or any entity in  which any of our officers, directors or such employee has an interest of more than 5%, except pursuant to the company's equity incentive plans; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• engage in any other transaction with any of our directors, officers or employees of our Adviser or our Administrator, or any entity in which any of our  directors, officers or such employee has an interest of more than 5% (except that our Adviser may lease office space in a building that we own, provided that the rental rate under the lease is determined by our independent directors to be at a fair  market rate).  
[END TABLE]
Where allowed by applicable rules and regulations, from time to time we may enter into transactions with our Adviser or one or more of its affiliates. A majority of our independent directors and a majority of our directors not otherwise interested in a transaction with our Adviser must approve all such transactions with our Adviser or its affiliates.  It is our current policy that we will not purchase any property from or co-invest with our Adviser, any of its affiliates or any business in which our Adviser or any of its subsidiaries have invested except that we may make leases to existing and prospective portfolio companies of entities advised by our Adviser, as long as the portfolio company is not controlled by that entity and the transaction is approved by both companies' boards. If we decide to change this policy on co-investments with our Adviser or its affiliates, we will seek approval of this decision from our stockholders. 
Indemnification 
In our Articles of Restatement (our "Charter") and Bylaws, we have agreed to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers by providing, among other things, that we will indemnify such officer or director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he or she may be required to pay in actions or proceedings, which he or she is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer or other agent of ours, and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Maryland law our Charter and our Bylaws. 
Each of the Advisory and Administration Agreements provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their duties and obligations, our Adviser, our Administrator and their respective officers, managers, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with them are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser's or our Administrator's services under the current Advisory or Administration Agreements, respectively, or otherwise as an investment adviser of ours. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for the Notice or other proxy materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single copy of the Notice or other proxy materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. 
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are Gladstone Commercial stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A single Notice will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Notice, please notify your broker or us. Direct your written request to Investor Relations at 1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite 100, McLean, Virginia 22102 or call our toll-free investor relations line at 1-866-366-5745. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their brokers. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the Notice to a stockholder at the address to which a single copy of the Notice was delivered.  PRIVACY NOTICE 
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
From time to time, we may receive nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders. We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as required by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Administrator, its affiliates or authorized service providers that have a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their discretion. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
Michael LiCalsi
