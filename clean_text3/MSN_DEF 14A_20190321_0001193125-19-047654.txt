PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD MARCH 21, 2019 
To Our Stockholders: 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors ("Board of Directors" or "Board") of Emerson Radio Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Emerson" or the "Company"), to be used at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the law offices of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP located at 43rd Floor, Gloucester Tower, The Landmark, 15 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong, on Thursday, March 21, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., local time (Wednesday, March 20, 2019, at 10:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time), or at any adjournment or adjournments thereof.

We expect to begin mailing this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card to our stockholders on or about February 22, 2019.

[END TABLE]

  5.  To consider such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof.   
[END TABLE]
Important Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on March 21, 2019. 
Our proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting, 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders (which contains our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018) and proxy card, are available on the Internet at http://www.astproxyportal.com/ast/02008. 
VOTING PROCEDURES AND REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES 
The accompanying proxy card is designed to permit each of our stockholders as of the record date to vote on each of the proposals properly brought before the annual meeting. As of the record date, there were 21,042,652 shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share, outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each outstanding share of our common stock is entitled to one vote. 
The holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. If a quorum is not present, the annual meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is obtained.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions, but not broker non-votes, are treated as shares present and entitled to vote, and will be counted as a "no" vote on all matters other than the election of directors and the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Broker non-votes are treated as not entitled to vote, and so reduce the absolute number, but not the percentage of votes needed for approval of a matter. Broker non-votes occur when nominees, such as banks and brokers holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners, do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial holders at least ten days before the meeting. If that happens, the nominees may vote those shares only on matters deemed "routine" by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), such as the ratification of auditors. Nominees cannot vote on non-routine matters unless they receive voting instructions from beneficial holders, resulting in so-called "broker non-votes." 
Assuming that a quorum is present, directors will be elected by a plurality vote (Proposal 1). There is no right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. As a result, abstentions and "broker non-votes" will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal. The election of directors is not considered to be a "routine" matter and brokers are not permitted to vote on this matter if the broker has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Accordingly, it is important that beneficial owners instruct their brokers how they wish to vote the shares. 
Assuming that a quorum is present, the approval of the proposals regarding ratification of the appointment of MSPC Certified Public Accountants and Advisors, A Professional Corporation ("MSPC"), as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 (Proposal 2), approval, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as set forth in this proxy statement (Proposal 3), and approval of any other matter that may properly come before the annual meeting will require that an affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes be cast on these proposals, in person or by proxy, to approve these proposals. As a result, abstentions will have the same practical effect as a negative vote on these proposals, and "broker non-votes", if any, will not affect the outcome of the vote on these proposals. The proposal for the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm is considered to be a "routine" matter, and hence the Company does not expect that there will be a significant number of broker non-votes on such proposal. 
Assuming that a quorum is present, with respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 4), the option of every year, every two years or every three years that receives the highest number of votes cast will be the frequency of that vote that has been approved by the Company's stockholders on an advisory basis. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will not have an effect on the vote for this proposal. 
As of the record date, S&T International Distribution Ltd. ("S&T"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Grande N.A.K.S. Ltd. ("N.A.K.S."), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nimble Holdings Company Limited (formerly known as The Grande Holdings Limited) ("Nimble"), collectively have the shared power to vote and direct the disposition of 15,243,283 shares, or approximately 72.4%, of the Company's outstanding common stock. Accordingly, the Company is a "controlled company" as defined in Section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide. 
The accompanying proxy card provides space for you to instruct the designated individuals how to vote your shares. You may vote in favor of, against, or abstain from voting on any proposal except for Proposals 1 and 4. With respect to Proposal 1 (the election of directors), you may, if you desire, indicate on the proxy card that you are not authorizing the designated individuals to vote your shares for one or more of the nominees. With respect to Proposal 4 (the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers), votes may be cast for one, two or three years, or abstain from voting, and the result will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast. The Company's Board of Directors urges you to complete, sign, date and return the proxy card in the accompanying envelope, which is postage prepaid for mailing in the United States.  The Company's Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the proposals presented in this proxy statement. Specifically, the Board of Directors recommends you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the nominees for director identified herein;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of MSPC as the Company's independent registered  public accountants for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" conducting future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive  officers every "Three Years."  
[END TABLE]
When a signed proxy card is returned with choices specified with respect to voting matters, the individuals designated on the proxy card will vote the shares in accordance with the stockholder's instructions. The Company has designated Duncan Hon and Michael Binney as proxies for the stockholders. If you desire to name another person as your proxy, you may do so by crossing out the names of the designated proxies and inserting the names of the other persons to act as your proxies. In that case, it will be necessary for you to sign the proxy card and deliver it to the person named as your proxy and for the named proxy to be present and vote at the annual meeting. Proxy cards so marked should not be mailed to us. 
If no specific instructions are given, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors as described in the second preceding paragraph. If any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the annual meeting, the proxies will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. 
You have the unconditional right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to the voting at the annual meeting by taking any act inconsistent with the proxy. Acts inconsistent with the proxy include notifying our Secretary in writing of your revocation, executing a subsequent proxy, or personally appearing at the annual meeting and casting a contrary vote. However, no revocation shall be effective unless at or prior to the annual meeting we have received notice of such revocation. 
At least ten (10) days before the annual meeting, the Company will make a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting. The list will be open for inspection during ordinary business hours at the Company's offices located at 35 Waterview Blvd., Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, and will also be made available to stockholders present at the meeting.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Five directors are proposed to be elected at the annual meeting. If elected, each director will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected and qualified. The election of directors will be decided by a plurality vote. 
On January 16, 2019, the Board of Directors nominated the following individuals, each of whom currently serves as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, for election as directors to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified: Christopher Ho, Duncan Hon, Michael Binney, Kareem E. Sethi, and Kin Yuen. The Company has appointed Mr. Ho to serve as Chairman of the Board. All nominees have consented to serve if elected and the Company has no reason to believe that any of the nominees named will be unable to serve. If any nominee becomes unable to serve, (i) the shares represented by the designated proxies will be voted for the election of a substitute as the Company's Board of Directors may recommend, (ii) the Company's Board of Directors may reduce the number of directors to eliminate the vacancy or (iii) the Company's Board of Directors may fill the vacancy at a later date after selecting an appropriate nominee. 
The current Board of Directors nominated the individuals named below for election to our Board of Directors, and information regarding the background and qualifications of each of the nominees as of February 11, 2019, is set forth below. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" for additional information about the nominees, including their ownership of securities issued by Emerson.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
On March 25, 2013, The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ("HKEX") published a news release announcing the censure of The Grande Holdings Limited (now known as Nimble Holdings Company Limited) and certain of its then-existing and former directors, including Messrs. Ho and Binney, by the Listing Appeals Committee of the HKEX. The censure was related to the breach by The Grand Holdings Limited of certain disclosure obligations pursuant to Rule 13.09(1) of the HKEX listing rules in 2007-2008 regarding the company's 2007 financial performance and the directors for their breach of the director's undertaking under the HKEX listing rules to use best endeavors to procure the company's compliance with Rule 13.09(1). The HKEX required Mr. Ho to undergo training on listing rules compliance, which training requirement Mr. Ho completed in June 2013. Mr. Binney was also directed to attend training on listing rules compliance as a prerequisite to any future appointment as a director of an HKEX-listed company, which training requirement Mr. Binney completed in September 2016. 
Vote Required 
Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Emerson common stock voting in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will have no effect on the vote for election of directors.

(1)  Based, in part, upon disclosures filed on a Schedule 13D/A on February 15, 2019, by S&T International  Distribution Ltd. ("S&T") and on a Schedule 13D/A on February 15, 2019, by Wealth Warrior Global Ltd. ("Wealth Warrior"), these shares are owned directly by S&T, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of N.A.K.S., which  is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nimble. On September 26, 2017, Wealth Warrior acquired approximately 65.9% of the outstanding share capital of Nimble from Sino Bright Enterprises Co., Ltd., a company related to the Company's Chairman of  the Board, Mr. Christopher Ho, pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated September 22, 2017, for consideration of HK$0.180 per share (the "Nimble Acquisition"). Wealth Warrior financed the Nimble Acquisition through a  combination of debt forgiveness of HK$63,117,255 and the balance to be paid on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing, which payment was secured by a pledge of 1,000,000,000 of the acquired Nimble shares. As the owners of approximately  73.9% in the aggregate of Nimble, Wealth Warrior, Merchant Link Holdings Limited ("ML"), and Rise Vision Global Limited ("RV") share the indirect power to vote and dispose of the shares of the Company's common stock held for  the account of S&T and, accordingly, a change of control of the Company was deemed to have occurred. ML is wholly owned by Aurizon Enterprises Limited ("AE"), AE is wholly owned by Omen Charm Limited ("OC"), and OC is wholly  owned by Splendid Brilliance (PTC) Limited ("SB"). RV is wholly owned by Ocean Rose Global Limited ("OR"), OR is wholly owned by Praisewise Limited ("PL"), and PL is wholly owned by SB. Mr. Bingzhao Tan is the sole  director of each of AE, ML, OR and RV, and the sole director and sole shareholder of Wealth Warrior. Ms. Guichai He is the sole director of OC and PL, and is sole director and sole shareholder of SB. SB holds the shares of OC and PL in trust,  and serves as the sole trustee over such shares. Accordingly, AE and OR share the indirect power to vote and dispose of these shares held for the account of S&T. Mr. Tan is the settlor and a discretionary beneficiary of the shares of OC and  PL held in trust by SB. Accordingly, Mr. Tan and Ms. He may be deemed to share power to direct the voting and disposition of these shares held for the account of S&T and may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of such shares. The  address of Nimble, N.A.K.S. and S&T is Unit C01, 32/F, TML Tower, 3 Hoi Shing Road, Tsuen Wan, New Territories, Hong Kong.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors, officers, and stockholders who beneficially own more than 10% of any class of its equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with respect to the Company's equity securities with the SEC and the NYSE American. All reporting persons are required to furnish the Company with copies of all reports that such reporting persons file with the SEC pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. 
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments to these forms furnished to the Company, and Forms 5, along with amendments thereto, all parties subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) timely filed all such required reports during and with respect to Fiscal 2018, except that the Wealth Warrior Reporting Persons jointly filed a late Form 3 reporting the acquisition in September 2017 of the indirect power to vote and dispose of the Emerson shares held for the account of S&T.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES 
Board of Directors and Committees 
The Company's Board of Directors presently consists of five directors. The Board of Directors has determined that two of the director nominees, Messrs. Sethi and Yuen, meet the definition of independence as established by the NYSE American listing standards and applicable SEC rules. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management and direction of the Company and for establishing broad corporate policies. The Board of Directors meets periodically during the Company's fiscal year to review significant developments affecting the Company and to act on matters requiring Board of Director approval. The Board of Directors held three formal meetings during the Company's fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"), and also acted by unanimous written consent. During Fiscal 2018, each member of the Board of Directors participated in all meetings of the Board of Directors and all meetings of committees on which such member served, that were held during the period in which such director served during Fiscal 2018. The Company encourages, but does not require, members of the Board of Directors to attend annual meetings of stockholders. Three of the Company's directors who were nominated for re-election attended the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on March 21, 2018. 
The Board of Directors presently has one standing committee, the Audit Committee, which is a separately-designated standing audit committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10A-3 thereunder. From March 2013 until December 2018, the Board of Directors also had established an ad hoc Special Committee consisting solely of independent directors to evaluate possible strategic alternatives intended to enhance stockholder value. 
Controlled Company. The Company does not maintain a nominating committee or a compensation committee. So long as Nimble beneficially holds more than 50% of the outstanding common stock of Emerson, Emerson is a "controlled company" as defined in Section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the "Company Guide"). Accordingly, the Company relies on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements to have (i) a majority of independent directors, (ii) a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors or (iii) a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. The full Board of Directors, among other things, (i) identifies individuals qualified to become members of the Board of Directors and selects director nominees for election at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (ii) reviews and monitors matters related to management development and succession, (iii) develops and implements executive compensation policies and pay for performance criteria, and (iv) reviews and approves salaries, bonuses and incentive awards. 
Audit Committee. The Company's Audit Committee currently consists of Mr. Sethi (Chairman) and Mr. Yuen, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined meets the definition of independence as established by the NYSE American listing rules and SEC rules. Mr. Sethi is currently the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the "audit committee financial expert." Pursuant to Section 803(B)(2)(c) of the Company Guide, as a smaller reporting company the Company is required to have an audit committee of at least two independent members, as defined by the listing standards of the NYSE American. 
The Audit Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors, among other things, to: (i) serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's financial reporting process, internal control system and disclosure control system; (ii) review and appraise the audit efforts of the Company's independent auditors; (iii) assume direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and for the resolution of disputes between the independent auditors and the Company's management regarding financial reporting issues; and (iv) provide the opportunity for direct communication among the independent auditors, financial and senior management and the Board of Directors. During Fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee performed its duties under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors and   formally met four times. A copy of the Company's Audit Committee Charter is posted on the Company's website at www.emersonradio.com on the Investor Relations page. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
This report shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or incorporated by reference in any filing by the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under either act. 
The Audit Committee has (i) reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 with the Company's management and with the Company's independent registered public accountants, MSPC; (ii) discussed with the Company's independent registered public accountants the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"); and (iii) received the written disclosures and the letter from the Company's independent registered public accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with the Company's independent registered public accountants the independent registered public accountants' independence. 
The Audit Committee also considered whether the provision by the independent registered public accountants of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accountants. 
Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.  Considerations in Director Selection 
Procedures for Considering Nominations Made by Stockholders. Nominations for election to the Board of Directors may be made by the Company's Board of Directors or by any stockholder of any outstanding class of the Company's capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. The following procedures shall be utilized in considering any candidate for election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting, other than candidates who have previously served on the Board of Directors or who are recommended by the Board of Directors. Stockholder proposals for director nominations must be delivered to the Company's Secretary at its corporate headquarters not less than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is moved by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year's annual meeting, notice to be timely must be so delivered a reasonable time before the company begins to print and send its proxy materials for such annual meeting. In addition, pursuant to the Company's bylaws, stockholders who wish to nominate a person for election as a director at the annual meeting must deliver written notice to the President or Chairman of the Board of the Company at its corporate headquarters not less than twenty (20) days prior to the annual meeting; provided, however, that if the Company furnishes less than thirty (30) days' notice of any meeting, such notification must be deliver not later than ten (10) days following the date on which the Company provided such notice, but in no event less than five (5) days prior to such annual meeting. Any such written notice must be directed to the attention of the Company's President or the Chairman of the Board at the Company's corporate headquarters and must comply with the applicable provisions of the Company's bylaws, as amended. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting will not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a notice as described above. A nomination notice must set forth as to each person whom the proponent proposes to nominate for election as a director: (a) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and (b) information that will enable the Company's Board of Directors to determine whether the candidate satisfies the minimum criteria and any additional criteria established by the Company's Board of Directors. 
Qualifications. The Company's Board of Directors has adopted guidelines describing the minimum qualifications for nominees and the qualities or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. Each nominee (i) must satisfy any legal requirements applicable to members of the Board of Directors; (ii) must have business, professional or other experience that will enable such nominee to provide useful input to the Board of Directors in its deliberations; and (iii) must have knowledge of the types of responsibilities expected of members of the board of directors of a public company. 
Identification and Evaluation of Candidates for the Board. Candidates to serve on the Board of Directors will be identified from all available sources, including recommendations made by stockholders, members of the Company's management and members of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors has a policy that there will be no differences in the manner in which its Board of Directors evaluates nominees recommended by stockholders and nominees recommended by it or management, except that no specific process shall be mandated with respect to the nomination of any individuals who have previously served on the Board of Directors. The evaluation process for individuals other than existing members of the Board of Directors will include a review of the information provided to the Board of Directors by the proponent and a review of such other information as the Board of Directors shall determine to be relevant. 
Diversity Considerations in Director Nominations. The Company does not have a formal diversity policy. The Company believes its Board of Directors represents a collection of individuals with a variety of complementary skills which, as a group, possess the appropriate skills and experience to oversee the Company's business. The Board of Directors considers a wide variety of qualifications, attributes and other factors and recognizes that a diversity of viewpoints and practical experiences can enhance the effectiveness of the Company's Board of Directors.  Board Leadership Structure 
The Company does not have a formal policy regarding whether the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be combined or separated. The Board of Directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide independent oversight of management. The Board of Directors understands that there is no single, generally accepted approach to providing board leadership and that given the dynamic and competitive environment in which the Company operates, the right board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Currently, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board are separate. Currently Mr. Ho serves as the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Hon serves as the Chief Executive Officer. 
Role in Risk Oversight 
Although the Company's management is responsible for implementing systems and processes to identify and manage risks, the Company's Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the Company's risk management processes. In carrying out its oversight responsibility, the Board of Directors has delegated to individual committees certain elements of its risk oversight function. This oversight is administered primarily through the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board of Directors' review and approval of the Company's annual budget (prepared and presented to  the Board of Directors by the management team), including discussion of the opportunities and challenges facing its business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee's oversight of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and its  discussions with management and the independent accountants regarding the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and financial reporting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board of Directors' review of executive officer compensation and its relationship to the Company's  business plans.  
[END TABLE]
Process for Sending Communications to the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has established a procedure that enables stockholders to communicate in writing with members of the Board of Directors. Any such communication should be addressed to the Company's Secretary and should be sent to such individual at c/o Emerson Radio Corp., 35 Waterview Blvd., Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Any such communication must state, in a conspicuous manner, that it is intended for distribution to the entire Board of Directors. Under the procedures established by the Board of Directors, upon the Secretary's receipt of such a communication, the Company's Secretary will send a copy of such communication to each member of the Board of Directors, identifying it as a communication received from a stockholder. Absent unusual circumstances, at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors held more than two days after such communication has been distributed, the Board of Directors will consider the substance of any such communication. 
Codes of Ethics 
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers ("Code of Ethics") that applies to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller and Treasurer. This Code of Ethics was established with the intention of focusing Senior Financial Officers on areas of ethical risk, providing guidance to help them recognize and deal with ethical issues, providing mechanisms to report unethical conduct, fostering a culture of honesty and accountability, deterring wrongdoing and promoting fair and accurate disclosure and financial reporting. 
The Company has also adopted a Code of Conduct for Officers, Directors and Employees of Emerson Radio Corp. and Its Subsidiaries ("Code of Conduct"). We prepared this Code of Conduct to help all officers, directors   and employees understand and comply with the Company's policies and procedures. Overall, the purpose of the Company's Code of Conduct is to deter wrongdoing and promote (i) honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; (ii) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company; (iii) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; (iv) prompt internal reporting of code violations to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code of Conduct; and (v) accountability for adherence to the Code of Conduct. 
The Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct are posted on the Company's website at www.emersonradio.com on the Investor Relations page. If the Company makes any substantive amendments to, or grants any waiver (including any implicit waiver) from a provision of the Code of Ethics or the Code of Conduct, and that relates to any element of the Code of Ethics definition enumerated in Item 406 (b) of Regulation S-K, the Company will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on its website or in a current report on Form 8-K.

Equity Compensation Plan Information 
The Company did not have any equity compensation plans in existence as of March 31, 2018.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
From time to time, Emerson engages in business transactions with its controlling stockholder, Nimble, and one or more of Nimble's direct and indirect subsidiaries. Set forth below is a summary of such transactions. 
Controlling Stockholder 
S&T, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of N.A.K.S., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nimble, collectively have the shared power to vote and direct the disposition of 15,243,283 shares, or approximately 72.4%, of the Company's outstanding common stock as of February 11, 2019. Accordingly, the Company is a "controlled company" as defined in Section 801(a) of the NYSE American Company Guide. 
Related Party Transactions 
Return of Pledged Collateral to S&T 
In April 2016, the Company, upon a request made by S&T, considered and agreed to return to S&T the $500,000 of collateral which S&T had paid to the Company in September 2014 as part of the indemnification agreement between S&T, Nimble and the Company pertaining to an Internal Revenue Service challenge of the Company's March 31, 2010 earnings and profits calculations underlying the taxability of a dividend paid during March 2010 to all of it stockholders, net of the $79,000 in expenses incurred by the Company in defending the IRS challenge. On April 29, 2016, the Company paid $421,000 to S&T to effectuate the release of the collateral net of the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Company. From September 30, 2014 through March 31, 2016, this pledged collateral had been recorded by the Company as restricted cash on its balance sheet. 
Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
The Company enters into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers. These agreements require the Company to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to the Company, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. The Company also intends to enter into indemnification agreements with its future directors and officers. 
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Parties 
It is the policy of the Company that any proposed transaction between the Company and related parties, as defined by the Financial Accounting Standard Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 850 (ASC 850), that will or may reasonably be expected to involve an aggregate amount that exceeds $120,000 in a fiscal year must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee prior to any action in furtherance of such potential transaction being taken by the Board or any executive officer. In reviewing and approving proposed transactions between the Company and related parties, the Audit Committee will determine whether the proposed transaction is entirely fair to the Company and in the Company's best interest. For purposes of the policy, related parties are as defined within ASC 850, generally, but not limited, meaning (i) an officer or director of the Company or the member of the immediate family of any of them or (ii) any other corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, trust or other entity or organization in which one or more of the Company's officers or directors are (a) directors, officers, trustees or other fiduciaries or (b) have a financial interest.  PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF 
MSPC AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS OF THE COMPANY 
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2019 
The Audit Committee has appointed MSPC as the Company's independent registered public accountants to audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, and has further directed that management submit the selection of independent registered public accountants for ratification by the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting. Stockholder ratification of the selection of MSPC is not required by our by-laws or otherwise. However, the Company is submitting the selection of MSPC to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain MSPC. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if it is determined that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Representatives of the firm of MSPC are expected to be present at the Company's annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Audit Committee's charter, all audit and audit-related work and all permitted non-audit work performed by the Company's independent registered public accountants, MSPC, is approved in advance by the Audit Committee, including the proposed fees for such work, in order to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the public accountants' independence. The Audit Committee is informed of each service actually rendered. All fees described below were approved by the Audit Committee in compliance with such pre-approval policies and procedures for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Fees. Audit fees billed to the Company by MSPC for the audit of the financial statements included in  the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, and reviews by MSPC of the financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, for the  fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled approximately $100,000 and $112,000, respectively.

Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock is present and voting, either in person or by proxy, is required for the ratification of the Company's independent registered public accountants. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF MSPC AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and in accordance with the approval by our stockholders at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, to hold such vote once every three years, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers in Fiscal 2018. This advisory vote, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" vote, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the Company's executive compensation policies and programs and the compensation paid to our named executive officers in Fiscal 2018. Although this advisory vote is non-binding, our Board of Directors will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our named executive officer compensation and related executive compensation programs. 
We encourage stockholders to read the "Executive Compensation" section in this proxy statement, including the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure, which describes the structure and amounts of the compensation of our named executive officers in Fiscal 2018. The compensation of our named executive officers is designed to enable us to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead us successfully in a competitive environment. 
We are asking that our stockholders indicate their support of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address specific items of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and our executive compensation policies and procedures as described in this proxy statement. Stockholders who would like to communicate with our Board of Directors should refer to "Stockholder Communications and Proposals" in this proxy statement for additional information. 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as described in the Company's proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018 and the other compensation-related tables and disclosure." 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock is present and voting, either in person or by proxy, is required for the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers in Fiscal 2018. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT  PROPOSAL 4: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY 
OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are again asking our stockholders to provide their input with regard to the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers, such as Proposal 3 of this proxy statement. In particular, we are asking whether the advisory vote on executive compensation should occur once every year, every two years or every three years. 
The Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs once every three years is the most appropriate alternative for the Company and therefore the Board recommends that you vote for a three-year interval for the advisory vote on executive compensation. In determining to recommend that stockholders vote for a frequency of once every three years, the Board considered how an advisory vote at this frequency will provide our stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our overall compensation philosophy, policies and practices in the context of our long-term business results for the corresponding period, while avoiding over-emphasis on short-term variations in compensation and business results. An advisory vote occurring once every three years will also permit our stockholders to observe and evaluate the effect of any changes to our executive compensation policies and practices which have occurred since the last advisory vote on executive compensation, including changes made in response to the outcome of a prior advisory vote on executive compensation. 
You may cast your vote for your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, or three years or abstain from voting when you vote in response to the resolution set forth below: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company determine, on an advisory basis, whether the preferred frequency of an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as set forth in the Company's proxy statement should be every year, every two years, or every three years." 
Vote Required 
The choice of frequency that receives the highest number of affirmative "FOR" votes will be considered the advisory vote of our stockholders. You may vote "FOR" one year, "FOR" two years, or "FOR" three years or "ABSTAIN." A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation will not be voted with respect to such proposal although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of this proposal. 
Although this vote is advisory and not binding, the Board will carefully review the results of the vote in making the determination as to the frequency of future advisory votes on our executive compensation. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE OPTION OF ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH STOCKHOLDERS ARE PROVIDED AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS AND PROPOSALS 
The Company's Board of Directors has established a procedure that enables stockholders to communicate in writing with members of the Company's Board of Directors. Any such communication should be addressed to the Company's Secretary and should be sent to such individual c/o Emerson Radio Corp., 35 Waterview Blvd., Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Any such communication must state, in a conspicuous manner, that it is intended for distribution to the entire Board of Directors. Under the procedures established by the Board of Directors, upon the Secretary's receipt of such a communication, the Company's Secretary will send a copy of such communication to each member of the Board of Directors, identifying it as a communication received from a stockholder. Absent unusual circumstances, at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors held more than two days after such communication has been distributed, the Board of Directors will consider the substance of any such communication. 
Stockholder proposals to be presented at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 ("Fiscal 2019"), for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting, must be received by the Company at its offices located at 35 Waterview Blvd., Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, addressed to the Secretary, on or before October 25, 2019. If, however, the date of the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders for Fiscal 2019 is changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of its annual meeting held for Fiscal 2018, the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held for Fiscal 2019. Such stockholder proposals must comply with the Company's bylaws and the requirements of Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act. See "Election of Directors" for information on stockholder submissions of nominations for election to the Board of Directors. 
Rule 14a-4 of the Exchange Act governs the Company's use of discretionary proxy voting authority with respect to a stockholder proposal that is not addressed in the proxy statement. With respect to the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders for Fiscal 2019, if the Company is not provided notice of a stockholder proposal prior to January 8, 2020, the Company will be permitted to use its discretionary voting authority when the proposal is raised at the meeting, without any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement. 
PERSONS MAKING THE SOLICITATION 
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company will pay the cost of soliciting proxies in the accompanying form. The Company's officers, who will not be paid any additional compensation for such solicitation, may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, telegraph or fax. Upon request, the Company will reimburse brokers, dealers, banks and trustees, or their nominees, for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners of the Company's shares of common stock. We have retained the services of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company to solicit proxies by mail, telephone, telegraph or personal contact. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board of Directors is not aware of any matter to be presented for action at the meeting other than the matters set forth herein. Should any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders arise, the proxies in the enclosed form confer upon the person or persons entitled to vote the shares represented by such proxies' discretionary authority to vote the same in accordance with their best judgment in the interest of Emerson.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
A copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, including financial statements, accompanies this proxy statement. The Annual Report is not to be regarded as proxy soliciting material or as a communication by means of which any solicitation is to be made. The Company filed an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K in July 2018 in order to include certain information regarding our management, compensation and other matters. All of the information included in such amendment has been updated and is included in this proxy statement. A copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC, is available (excluding exhibits) without cost to stockholders upon written request made to Investor Relations, Emerson Radio Corp., 35 Waterview Blvd., Parsippany, New Jersey 07054 or on-line at the Company's web site: www.emersonradio.com.
