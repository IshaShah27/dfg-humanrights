PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by and on behalf of the Board of Directors of Getty Realty Corp. (hereinafter called the "Company" or "Getty"), to be voted at the Company's Annual Meeting to be held at the offices of Arent Fox LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10019 on April 30, 2019 at 3:30 p.m., and at any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Annual Meeting"), for the purposes of (1) electing a Board of Directors; (2) holding an advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation; and (3) ratifying the appointment of independent auditors. We will also transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
Record Date, Voting Rights, Outstanding Shares and Quorum 
At the close of business on March 6, 2019, the record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, there were 40,866,854 shares of Getty common stock outstanding. Each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote. The common shares vote as a single class. In order to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting, there must be present, or voting by proxy, holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock. 
Under Maryland law, shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by a broker or nominee which are represented at the Annual Meeting, but with respect to which such broker or nominee is not empowered by the beneficial owner of the stock to vote on a particular proposal) will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Voting Requirements 
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record on how to vote your shares. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting in order to vote. 
All valid proxies received before the Annual Meeting will be exercised. All shares represented by a proxy will be voted, and where a proxy specifies a stockholder's choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with that specification. If no choice is indicated on the proxy with respect to any one or more of the proposals, the shares will be voted in favor of such proposal(s). At the discretion of the persons named in the enclosed proxy card or vote instruction form, such proxy holder may also vote on any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
Vote Required 
If a quorum is achieved at the Annual Meeting, the following voting requirements will apply: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Board Elections. The affirmative vote of a plurality of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required  for the election of each nominee to our Board of Directors. With respect to each director nominee, you may vote "for" such nominee or "withhold" your vote as to such nominee. Director nominees with the most votes cast  "for" such nominee's election will be elected to our Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For purposes of the election of directors, abstentions and broker  non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation. The affirmative vote of a majority of the  votes cast at the Annual Meeting will be necessary to approve the advisory vote on executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For purposes of the advisory vote to approve the named executive officer compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes  cast at the Annual Meeting will be necessary to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For purposes of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.   
[END TABLE]
Broker Non-Votes 
Broker non-votes occur when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed "non-routine." Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner of the shares is entitled to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee can still vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but cannot vote the shares with respect to "non-routine" matters. With respect to the three proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement, only Proposal 3 – Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP – is considered to be "routine" and brokers, banks or other nominees generally have discretionary voting power with respect to such proposal. We encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares. See "Vote Required" section above for the treatment of broker non-votes with respect to each of the three proposals. 
If you vote by proxy, the individuals named on the proxy card (your "proxies" or "proxy holders") will vote your shares in the manner you indicate. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting stockholders by mail through our employees, we will request banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to solicit customers for whom they hold our stock and we will reimburse them for their reasonable, out-of-pocket costs. We may also use the services of our officers, directors and others to solicit proxies personally or by telephone, without additional compensation. 
Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials 
From the date of mailing of the Notice of Internet Availability through the conclusion of the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be able to access all of the proxy materials on the internet at www.proxyvote.com. The proxy materials will be available free of charge. The Notice of Internet Availability will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials (including our Annual Report to stockholders) over the internet or through other methods specified at the website designated in the Notice of Internet Availability. The designated website contains instructions as to how to vote your shares over the internet or by telephone. The Notice of Internet Availability also instructs you as to how you may request a paper or email copy of the proxy card. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability and would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability. 
The rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") permit us to deliver a single Notice of Internet Availability or set of Annual Meeting materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. We have delivered only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or set of Annual Meeting materials to multiple stockholders who share the same address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or set of Annual Meeting materials to any stockholder at the shared address   to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. If you prefer to receive separate copies of the Notice of Internet Availability or sets of Annual Meeting materials, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1-800-542-1061, or in writing at Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you are currently a stockholder sharing an address with another stockholder and wish to receive only one copy of future Notices of Internet Availability or set of Annual Meeting materials for your household, please contact Broadridge at the above phone number or address. 
The Notice of Internet Availability or Annual Meeting materials will be sent to stockholders on, and will be available on the internet on or about, March 15, 2019.  PROPOSAL NO. 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
(Item No.  1 on the Proxy Card) 
Nominees for Election at the Annual Meeting 
Getty's directors are elected at each annual meeting of stockholders and hold office for a term of one year and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. The Board of Directors has nominated seven candidates for election as directors for a one-year term ending at the 2020 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders or when their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required for the election of each nominee to our Board of Directors. With respect to each director nominee, you may vote "for" such nominee or "withhold" your vote as to such nominee. Director nominees with the most votes cast "for" such nominee's election will be elected to our Board of Directors. For purposes of the election of directors, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. 
You may use the proxy card furnished to you to cast your votes for the election of the director nominees named in the table below. In the event that any of the nominees should become unable or unwilling to serve as a director prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting, we intend to vote your proxy "for" the election of the substitute nominee, if any, who is designated by the Board of Directors.

Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "for" the election of each nominee for director.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RELATED MATTERS 
Board of Directors and Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of Christopher J. Constant, Milton Cooper, Philip E. Coviello, Leo Liebowitz, Mary Lou Malanoski, Richard E. Montag, and Howard B. Safenowitz. Our Board is elected by the stockholders to oversee the performance of the Company's business affairs and to set broad strategy for the Company's growth. The Board of Directors acts as an advisor to senior management and monitors its performance. It also oversees the Company's compliance efforts. To help discharge its responsibilities, the Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines on significant corporate governance issues. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address, among other things, the size and composition of the Board of Directors, director independence, committee membership and structure, meetings and executive sessions, and director selection and training. 
The Charters for each of the committees of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Getty's Business Conduct Guidelines (which serve as our code of ethics under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and our code of business conduct and ethics under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, and covers officers, employees and directors), may all be accessed through the Getty website at www.gettyrealty.com by clicking on "Investors/Corporate Governance". The Board of Directors and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are committed to the needs of the Board and, in evaluating possible director candidates, have historically considered the knowledge and judgment, and breadth of skills, experience and attributes, of a candidate with a goal of identifying the most suitable person based on merit, without regard to gender, race, color, religion or national origin. From time to time, the Board of Directors and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee have re-evaluated their policies regarding diversity among the Board of Directors, specifically including gender and racial diversity. In February 2018, the Board of Directors determined to revise the Director Qualification Standards section of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines to reaffirm the potential benefits of diversity among the Board of Directors, by specifically stating that (i) diversity (based on factors commonly associated with diversity such as race, gender, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation or identity, as well as on broader principles such as diversity of perspective and experience) would be one of the elements to be considered in evaluating any particular director candidate, and (ii) in carrying out its duties, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee shall be responsible for assessing the appropriate balance of skills and characteristics required of members of the Board of Directors and would actively seek to broaden the diversity composition of the Board of Directors. In furtherance thereof, in the summer of 2018, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee sought input from, and solicited recommendations from, management and other members of the Board of Directors regarding possible director nominee candidates. In connection therewith, Mr. Constant reached out to his direct contacts, other REIT executives, senior investment bankers, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and the Company's investor relations firm for suggestions for diverse candidates whose expertise and personal characteristics would align with the Company's long-term business strategy. After personally interviewing approximately ten recommended candidates, Mr. Constant recommended three candidates from this group to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, each of whom was personally interviewed and evaluated by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. In October 2018, after the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considered, among other criteria, Ms. Malanoski's (i) personal and professional integrity, ethics and values, (ii) educational and professional background, (iii) experience in corporate management, (iv) experience as a board member, (v) "independence," as defined by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, (vi) financial literacy and (vii) ability to foster a diversity of backgrounds and views and to compliment the Board's existing strengths, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that it increase the number of authorized directors constituting the Board from six to seven and appoint Ms. Malanoski to fill the vacancy created thereby. In October 2018, in furtherance of the implementation of its revised Corporate Governance Guidelines and its desire to broaden the diversity of its membership, the Board of Directors so acted. (For additional information on this issue, see "Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee" discussion on page 11 of this Proxy Statement.) 
In addition to our website availability, copies of any of the Charters for each of the committees of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and/or Getty's Business Conduct Guidelines may also be obtained by submitting a written request to Mr. Joshua Dicker, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, at the address for Getty's executive offices provided in this Proxy Statement. The Business Conduct Guidelines apply to all employees, officers and directors of the Company and waivers of the Business Conduct Guidelines for directors or   executive officers, if any, will be disclosed as required by the rules and regulations of the SEC. There were no such waivers in 2018. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our Board of Directors had seven members. The Board of Directors has nominated seven candidates for election as directors for a one-year term ending at the 2020 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders and when their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
The Board does not have a policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman of the Board, as the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to have the flexibility to make the determination whether the same person should serve as both the CEO and Chairman of the Board at any given point in time, or whether the roles should be separate, depending on, among other factors, the position and direction of the Company and the membership of the Board. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with separate Chairman and CEO positions, is appropriate for the Company because it separates the leadership of the Board from the day to day leadership of the Company. The Board believes that, in addition to the Lead Independent Director, separating the position of Chairman from the CEO better positions the Board to evaluate the performance of management and enables the Chairman to provide guidance to the CEO. 
In his role as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Liebowitz is responsible for enhancing Board effectiveness, in particular by ensuring that the Board works as a cohesive team; ensuring that the Board has adequate resources and that there is a process in place to assure that the Board is presented with full, timely and relevant information; ensuring that there is a process in place to monitor best practices that relate to the responsibilities of the Board; and assessing the effectiveness of the overall Board and individual directors on a regular basis. He is also responsible for Board management, in particular by providing oversight on the agendas for Board meetings; consulting with the CEO regarding the membership and the chairs for Board committees; ensuring that the independent directors meet regularly without management present to discuss the effectiveness of the CEO and the Board; and by chairing Board meetings. 
In his role as the CEO, Mr. Constant is responsible for setting a strategic vision for the Company and seeking to align the Company, internally and externally, with that strategic vision. In addition, Mr. Constant, as CEO, is responsible for day to day leadership of the Company, promoting Company performance through his leadership, and leading the Company in the execution of its business plan. Our CEO also serves on our Board, which we believe helps the CEO to serve as a bridge between management and the Board of Directors, ensuring that both groups act with a common purpose. We believe that the CEO's presence on the Board enhances his ability to provide insight and direction on important strategic initiatives to both management and the independent directors and, at the same time, ensures that the appropriate level of independent oversight is applied to all decisions by the Board. 
Role of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight 
It is management's responsibility to assess and manage the various risks the Company faces and the Board's responsibility to oversee management in this effort. In exercising its oversight, the Board has delegated primary responsibility for risk assessment and risk management oversight to the Audit Committee. Under its Charter, the Audit Committee's responsibilities include discussing with management the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and the Company's material financial risk exposures and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control such exposures. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from management on the Company's enterprise risk management practices and risk mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee also oversees the Company's legal and regulatory compliance programs and internal audit function. Our full Board regularly reviews the Company's strategic plans and objectives, including the risks that may affect the achievement of these strategic plans and objectives. 
Independence of Directors 
The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Malanoski and Messrs. Cooper, Coviello, Montag and Safenowitz are "independent" as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. In making these determinations, the Board of Directors considered all relevant facts and circumstances, including the independence standards set forth in Section 303A.02 of the rules of the NYSE. The Board of Directors affirmatively determined that none of the directors, or any of their respective family members, other than Mr. Liebowitz and Mr. Constant, has had any relationship with Getty (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Getty), other   than as a stockholder and director of Getty. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of the directors, other than Mr. Liebowitz and Mr. Constant, is "independent." 
It has been and will continue to be the practice of the Board of Directors to meet at least quarterly each year and have Mr. Liebowitz, as Chairman, chair such meetings. Additionally, it has been the practice of the independent directors to meet in executive session at least quarterly each year, and to have Mr. Safenowitz, who has served since February 25, 2010 as the Company's Lead Independent Director, chair such sessions. 
Directors' Meetings 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held five (5) meetings. Each of the directors nominated for election at the Annual Meeting attended all of the 2018 meetings of the Board of Directors during the period in which he or she was eligible to attend, and all of the 2018 meetings of Committees of the Board on which such director served in 2018. Each of the directors nominated for election at the Annual Meeting also attended the annual meeting of stockholders in May 2018, except for Ms. Malanoski, who was not appointed as a director until October 2018. 
Committees 
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, a Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee, the membership and functions of which are described below. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met four (4) times in 2018. The Audit Committee consisted of Messrs. Coviello (Chairman), Montag and Safenowitz and, effective as of her appointment in October 2018, Ms. Malanoski. The Audit Committee selects the independent registered public accounting firm that audits the consolidated financial statements of Getty and its subsidiaries, discusses the scope and the results of the audit with our independent registered public accounting firm, and monitors Getty's financial accounting and reporting practices. The Audit Committee also examines and discusses the adequacy of Getty's internal control over financial reporting with the independent registered public accounting firm, our internal auditors, and with management. The Board has designated the Audit Committee to take the lead in overseeing our risk assessment and risk management, along with overseeing compliance with our Business Conduct Guidelines. In addition to regular meetings, at least one Audit Committee member meets telephonically with management and Getty's independent auditors to review the Company's quarterly reports and other reports, as appropriate, prior to their full presentation to the Audit Committee and subsequent filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee met with management and Getty's independent auditors to review the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and recommended to the Board of Directors that the financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such year. See "Role of Board of Directors in Risk Oversight" on page 9 of this Proxy Statement for a discussion of the Audit Committee's role in risk assessment and risk management oversight. Additionally, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management management's specific disclosures contained in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Please also see the Audit Committee Report included at page 33 in this Proxy Statement. 
The Board of Directors determined that for the year ended December 31, 2018, each member of the Audit Committee (a) was (1) "independent" and (2) "financially literate" as such terms are defined in the listing standards of the NYSE and (b) met the independence tests set forth in Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC. The Board of Directors also determined that for the year ended December 31, 2018, Ms. Malanoski, Mr. Coviello and Mr. Montag each qualified as an "audit committee financial expert" under the relevant rules of the SEC, and that each of Ms. Malanoski, Mr. Coviello and Mr. Montag have the requisite accounting/financial management expertise required by the listing standards of the NYSE. 
The Charter of the Audit Committee provides that members of the Audit Committee may not be members of the audit committee of more than two other public companies unless such other memberships have been disclosed to the Board and the Board has determined that such simultaneous service does not impair the ability of such member to   serve effectively on the Audit Committee. None of the Audit Committee members served on the audit committee of more than two other public companies during 2018. 
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee met three (3) times in 2018. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee consisted of Messrs. Safenowitz (Chairman), Cooper, and Coviello. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee recommends nominees for election to the Board and reviews the role, composition and structure of the Board and its committees. As part of this review, the Committee evaluates (i) whether to have a Lead Independent Director, (ii) the responsibilities of the positions of Chairman of the Board and Lead Independent Director, and (iii) the qualifications for those positions, including whether the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors should be held by the Chief Executive Officer, an independent director, or a non-independent director other than the Chief Executive Officer. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also recommends candidates to the Board for election as officers. 
For a discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of the nominees for election to the Board, see the "Nominees for Election at the Annual Meeting" section on page 4 of this Proxy Statement. 
Historically, consistent with its Charter, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considered general principles of diversity in the broadest sense (including diversity of skills and perspectives) when identifying director nominees for the Board, however, the Committee did not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity specifically based on factors such as race, gender, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation or identity, in identifying director nominees. As noted above, in February 2018, the Board of Directors determined to revise the Director Qualification Standards section of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines to reaffirm the potential benefits of diversity among the Board of Directors, by specifically stating that (i) diversity (based on factors commonly associated with diversity such as race, gender, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation or identity, as well as on broader principles such as diversity of perspective and experience) would be one of the elements to be considered in evaluating any particular director candidate, and (ii) in carrying out its duties, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee shall be responsible for assessing the appropriate balance of skills and characteristics required of members of the Board of Directors and will actively seek to broaden the diversity composition of the Board of Directors. In addition, at its regular meeting held in February 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously confirmed its intention to expand the Board of Directors by at least one new member after the 2018 annual meeting and prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting, and to seek to appoint a qualified candidate to the newly-created position who can meet the needs of the Board of Directors, including by broadening the diversity composition of the Board of Directors. Throughout the summer and early fall of 2018, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee supported the objective of the Board of Directors by conducting a search for qualified candidates consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines for the proposed vacancy. In October 2018, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board that it increase the number of authorized directors constituting the Board from six to seven and nominated Ms. Malanoski for appointment to fill the vacancy created thereby. After due consideration of Ms. Malanoski's education and experience, the Board of Directors voted to increase the size of the Board from six directors to seven directors and, effective immediately thereafter, appointed Ms. Malanoski to the Board to fill the newly-created directorship. 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines do not include mandatory retirement ages or term limits applicable to directors. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews the performance and qualifications of each current director and considers the results of such evaluation when determining whether or not to recommend the nomination of such director for an additional term. In addition, although the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers length of service when recommending candidates for re-election, the Board does not believe that adopting a set term limit for directors serves the interests of the Company. Such limits may result in the loss of contributions from directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, increasing insight into the Company, its operations and its strategic direction. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews these policies as part of its annual governance review and will consider modifications to these policies as deemed necessary and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is "independent" as such term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. The Nominating/Corporate   Governance Committee Charter includes policies with regard to stockholder recommendations of nominees to the Board of Directors. 
Stockholders wishing to recommend candidates for election to the Board must supply information in writing regarding the candidate to Mr. Joshua Dicker, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, at the Company's executive offices. This information should include the candidate's name, biographical data and an analysis of the candidate based on the director candidate criteria described below. The recommendation must also include all information relating to the proposed director nominee that would be required to be disclosed in a solicitation of proxies for election of directors in an election contest under applicable securities law. Stockholders wishing to nominate a candidate must comply with the advance notice requirements in our Bylaws. Please refer to our Bylaws for more specific information. Our Bylaws were publicly filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 14, 2011, as amended February 26, 2019 and publicly filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. Additional information regarding any proposed nominees may be requested by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. 
Each nominee must possess fundamental qualities of intelligence, honesty, good judgment, and high standards of ethics, integrity, fairness and responsibility. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also will consider the following criteria in addition to other criteria the Committee deems appropriate, including the specific needs of the Board at the time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly held  company, and a general understanding of marketing, finance and other elements relevant to the success of a publicly traded company in todays business environment;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● ability to complement the Boards existing strengths.  
[END TABLE]
In reviewing prospective nominees, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also reviews the number of public company boards on which a director nominee serves to determine if the nominee will have the ability to devote adequate time to the work of the Board of Directors and its committees. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Company's Audit Committee Charter provide that members of the Audit Committee may not be members of the audit committee of more than two other public companies unless such other memberships   have been disclosed to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors has determined that such simultaneous service does not impair the ability of such member to effectively serve on the Company's Audit Committee. In addition, effective February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors revised the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide that directors may not serve on more than four other boards of public companies. 
On the basis of the information gathered in this process, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will determine which nominees to recommend to the Board. Recommendations and related information received prior to any Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee meeting where director nominees are to be considered will be considered at that meeting. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee uses the same process for evaluating all nominees, regardless of the source of the recommendation. This process includes, among other things, personal interviews, discussions with professional references, background checks, credit checks and resume verification. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has not received any recommendation for a director nominee for the Annual Meeting from any stockholder or group of stockholders. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee met two (2) times in 2018. The Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Cooper (Chairman), Coviello, Montag and Safenowitz. The Compensation Committee is responsible for developing and, with the approval of the Board, implementing the compensation plans, policies and programs of the Company and producing an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. It is the Compensation Committee's responsibility to ensure that compensation programs are designed to encourage high performance and promote accountability and assure that employee interests are aligned with the interests of the Company's stockholders. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is "independent" as such term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. 
The Compensation Committee also administers the Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives of Getty Realty Corp. and Participating Subsidiaries (the "Supplemental Retirement Plan") and the Getty Realty Corp. Second Amended and Restated 2004 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2004 Plan") and reviews, and recommends to the Board for its approval, the compensation of the directors and each of the named executive officers of Getty. 
The Compensation Committee's Charter provides that the Committee may delegate any or all of its responsibilities, except that the Committee may not delegate its responsibilities with respect to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● its annual review and approval of compensation for officers, directors and certain highly compensated  employees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● its recommendation to the Chairman of the Board of any changes in  non-management director compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● its management and annual review of, and responsibilities with respect to, all bonuses, incentive  compensation, equity-based compensation, and employee pension and welfare benefit plans; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● any other matters that involve executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation of Getty's named executive officers is recommended by the CEO to the Compensation Committee. The CEO reviews the performance of each executive officer (other than his own) with the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee considers the CEO's recommendations, evaluates the CEO's individual performance and establishes the compensation for each named executive officer, including the CEO. The CEO does not play any role in the Compensation Committee's deliberation of matters impacting his own compensation. No executive officer other than the CEO plays a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation.  Contacting the Board of Directors

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting and administering the compensation policies and practices for the executive officers of the Company. The Company's executive compensation program consists primarily of the following elements: base salary, cash incentive compensation, equity compensation and retirement plans. We do not utilize compensation policies or practices that create risks which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
This "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section describes generally the compensation policies and practices that the Company applies to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Christopher J. Constant, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer, Mark J. Olear, General Counsel, Joshua Dicker, and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Danion Fielding (each of the foregoing, a "Named Executive Officer" or "NEO"). For additional details about our NEOs for 2018, see "Executive Officers" at page 19 of this Proxy Statement and "Summary Compensation Table" at page 24 of this Proxy Statement. 
2018 Company Performance Highlights 
The following presents a summary of certain financial and operational highlights achieved by the Company in 2018 which, among other factors, were considered by the Compensation Committee in reaching its determinations regarding the performance and compensation of our Named Executive Officers. (See our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for additional details regarding each of these highlights.) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Strong Financial Performance.  2018 was a highly productive year for the Company, as its  performance and market position yielded strong returns. The Company delivered on key financial objectives, including meeting its published 2018 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) guidance. The Company increased its annual dividend  rate by 9.4% and generated total annual stockholder returns of 13.8% for the calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company declared $53.6 million of dividends, or $1.31 per share, as compared to $43.7 million of  dividends, or $1.16 per share, in the prior year, representing an increase of 12.9% on a per share basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported net earnings of $47.7 million, or $1.17 per share, as compared to net  earnings of $47.2 million, or $1.26 per share, in the prior year; funds from operations (FFO) of $73.6 million, or $1.80 per share, as compared to FFO of $74.6 million, or $2.00 per share, in the prior year; and AFFO of  $69.7 million, or $1.71 per share, as compared to AFFO of $62.0 million, or $1.66 per share, in the prior year.1  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Expanded and Enhanced Real Estate Portfolio.  During the year ended December 31, 2018,  the Company acquired fee simple interests in 41 convenience store and gasoline station or other automotive-related properties for an aggregate purchase price of $78.0 million. The leases associated with these acquisitions have a weighted  average initial term of 14.1 years and are expected to produce attractive returns. As a result of these transactions, the Company added a number of high-quality tenants and properties, diversified its tenant base, and expanded its geographic  presence in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. In addition, the Company advanced its portfolio management objectives during the year by selling 10 properties (generating $7.25 million of gross proceeds).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Broadened Redevelopment Program.  In 2018, the Company continued to advance and enlarge its  redevelopment program, which seeks to unlock embedded value within its existing net lease portfolio by taking certain convenience store and gasoline station properties and redeveloping them into either a new convenience

   and gasoline use or an alternative single-tenant net-lease retail use with higher returns. In 2018, rent commenced on six redevelopment projects, and, as  of December 31, 2018, the Company had six of its properties under active redevelopment for alternative uses. In addition to the six properties currently classified as redevelopment, the Company is in various stages of feasibility and planning  for the recapture of select properties from its net lease portfolio that are suitable for redevelopment to either a new convenience and gas use or for alternative single-tenant net lease retail uses. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had  signed leases on seven properties that are currently part of its net lease portfolio, which will be recaptured and transferred to redevelopment when the appropriate entitlements, permits and approvals have been secured.

[BEGIN TABLE]
● Strengthened the Companys Balance Sheet for Growth Initiatives. In 2018, the Company undertook  several actions to optimize its balance sheet for future growth, including:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  maintaining strong credit metrics, such as a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 3.4x* and a Net Debt to EBITDA  Ratio of 4.0x*;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  in March 2018, entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "Restated Credit  Agreement") amending and restating its prior credit agreement. Pursuant to the Restated Credit Agreement, the Company (i) increased its borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility")  from $175.0 million to $250.0 million, (ii) extended the maturity date of the Revolving Facility from June 2018 to March 2022, (iii) extended the maturity date of its unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") from June 2020 to  March 2023 and (iv) amended certain financial covenants and provisions. The Restated Credit Agreement also reflects reductions in the interest rate spreads for borrowings under each of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  also in March 2018, establishing a new  at-the-market equity offering program (the "ATM Program"), pursuant to which the Company is able to issue and sell shares of its common stock with an aggregate  sales price of up to $125.0 million through a consortium of banks acting as agents. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company utilized the ATM Program to issue 1.1 million shares, raising net proceeds of $30.1 million;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  in May 2018, receiving an investment grade rating of BBB- from Fitch  Ratings, which is expected to lead to greater access to debt capital and positions the Company to achieve a lower cost of capital over time; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  in June 2018, issuing $100.0 million of senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028 bearing interest at a  fixed rate of 5.47%. The senior unsecured notes were issued in a private placement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain of its affiliates (collectively, "Prudential") and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and  certain of its affiliates and are subject to substantially similar terms and conditions as the Company's existing senior unsecured notes with Prudential.  
[END TABLE]
Getty's Compensation Program 
Getty's compensation program for executive officers is designed to effectively manage the Company's aggregate annual compensation expense while providing executive officers with a total compensation package that is adequate to retain them, encourage and motivate their high performance and promote their accountability. Getty's compensation policies are also designed to promote increased stockholder value by aligning the financial interests of Getty's executive officers with those of its stockholders. The Compensation Committee believes that its current policies, plans and programs are adequate for these purposes. 
Getty's executive compensation program involves a combination of annual cash compensation, discretionary incentive compensation (cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards such as RSUs with dividend equivalents), 
* Capitalized terms are as defined in the Company's Restated Credit Agreement, Third Restated Prudential Note Purchase Agreement and MetLife Note Purchase Agreement. Calculations are as of December 31, 2018.   retirement and other plans, and perquisites and other benefits. Although the Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal policies for allocating compensation among the foregoing compensation components, in conducting its review and rendering its determinations, the Compensation Committee evaluates whether each Named Executive Officer is provided with a total compensation opportunity that achieves the key objectives of the compensation program while maintaining an appropriate cost structure. 
Base salary levels for NEOs are, in combination with other compensation components, considered by the Compensation Committee to be sufficient to achieve the objectives of Getty's compensation program. Total compensation, including discretionary annual cash incentive awards and RSU grants (including dividend equivalents paid with respect to such RSUs), are in aggregate amounts which the Compensation Committee considers sufficient to retain the NEOs and to align their interests with those of Getty's stockholders. 
In making executive compensation determinations, the Compensation Committee has also considered the results of the non-binding, advisory stockholder votes on the Company's executive compensation program. Our stockholders have approved the Company's executive compensation program each year since the advisory vote was first sought, most recently approving it by 97% of votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal in our 2018 Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee was mindful of our stockholders' endorsement of the Compensation Committee's decisions and policies and has maintained its general approach to executive compensation for decisions made to date. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from this year's and future advisory stockholder votes regarding the executive compensation program. 
Total compensation determinations by the Compensation Committee for each NEO are influenced in part by the particular responsibilities of the applicable executive position with additional consideration given to such NEO's individual performance. Our CEO reviews the performance of each NEO (other than himself) and provides compensation recommendations for all NEOs (including himself) to the Compensation Committee with respect to base salary amounts, cash bonuses and grants of equity based awards under the 2004 Plan consisting of RSUs (including dividend equivalents with respect to such RSUs). The Compensation Committee reviews and deliberates upon the CEO recommendations, evaluates the CEO's and each of the NEO's individual performances, and establishes the compensation for each NEO. The CEO does not play any role in the Compensation Committee's deliberation of matters impacting his own compensation. Although the Compensation Committee takes the CEO's recommendations under advisement, it independently evaluates the compensation recommendations for each NEO and in all instances exercises its discretion in making final compensation decisions in accordance with its authority and formal responsibilities set forth in its Charter. The Compensation Committee has direct knowledge of the performance of each of the NEOs through regular and special reports by these executives to the Board of Directors and Board Committees and through other interactions with these executives related to the Company's operations and performance. In reaching the executive compensation decisions described below, the Compensation Committee recognized the individual contributions that each NEO made towards the Company's operational and financial achievements highlighted above, while also recognizing each of their individual efforts, including the following notable accomplishments for each NEO:

[END TABLE]
The compensation of the CEO is discussed, deliberated upon and approved solely by the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee may periodically engage outside professional firms to assist in understanding compensation levels and programs in the broader marketplace and to provide advice on executive compensation. In 2018, the Compensation Committee did not engage the services of a compensation consultant and did not benchmark compensation elements against a peer group. 
The primary elements of compensation for our NEOs are the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Incentive compensation (discretionary annual cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards like RSUs with  dividend equivalents);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Retirement and other plans; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Perquisites and other benefits.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee examines whether each NEO's base salary is competitive and appropriate in view of such person's role, level of responsibility, experience and value to the Company, and relative to achieving the   overall goals of the compensation program for all NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries annually and in the interim if an executive officer's position or responsibilities change or if the Committee believes it is otherwise necessary or appropriate to do so. Salaries are not automatically increased on an annual basis if the Committee believes that a raise is not warranted by either individual or Company performance, or that other forms of compensation are more appropriate to advance compensation program objectives. 
As part of its process and in order to achieve the overall goals of Getty's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee determined to increase base salaries in 2019 from those in effect in 2018 by the following amounts for the following NEOs: Mr. Constant's base salary for 2019 was increased by 3.0%, and base salaries for 2019 for each of Messrs. Olear, Dicker and Fielding were increased by 3.0%, 3.4% and 3.8%, respectively. 
Incentive Compensation 
Cash Bonus 
The Compensation Committee believes that discretionary cash bonuses are useful on a case by case basis to motivate and reward executives for their contribution to annual operating results and Company achievements that help create value for our stockholders. Cash bonuses for NEOs are not guaranteed but have been awarded at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In deciding whether to award discretionary cash bonuses, the Compensation Committee makes its determinations as described above, based upon (i) recommendations from the Company's CEO, (ii) its review with the CEO of the performance of each NEO (other than the CEO himself), (iii) its evaluation of the CEO's individual performance, (iv) its informed judgment, in view of the Company's financial and operational performance, of each NEO's responsibilities and efforts, such NEO's contribution to the Company's overall performance and success, and the complexity or difficulty of the objectives that have been achieved by such NEO, (v) the relative significance of a cash bonus award toward meeting the overall goals of Getty's compensation program, and (vi) other relevant considerations. These factors are considered subjectively and no one factor is accorded any specific weight. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee awarded discretionary cash bonuses as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018. Specifically, Mr. Constant was paid a cash bonus of $340,000, Mr. Olear and Mr. Dicker were each paid a cash bonus of $235,000 and Mr. Fielding was paid a cash bonus of $180,000. 
Equity Incentive Awards 
The Company maintains the stockholder-approved 2004 Plan for officers and other valued employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, and members of the Board. The 2004 Plan allows for the grant of various types of stock-based awards, other than stock options, to eligible individuals. The 2004 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee, which has the power to determine eligibility, the types and sizes of awards, the price and timing of awards, terms of vesting, the acceleration or waiver of any vesting restriction and the timing and manner of settling vested awards. 
Generally, to better align the interests of the Company's NEOs with the interests of the Company's stockholders and to promote performance that will have a positive long-term impact on total stockholder return, the Compensation Committee annually grants equity-based awards under the 2004 Plan to the Company's NEOs, consisting of RSUs (including dividend equivalents paid with respect to such RSUs). These RSU awards vest over a five-year period subject to continued employment through the vesting date and, for all such RSU awards granted from and after 2009, are settled, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in cash or in shares of the Company's common stock upon the earlier of ten years after the grant date (or the first vesting date for RSU awards granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018) or termination of employment. Settlement of vested RSUs granted prior to 2009 is deferred until termination of service pursuant to the award agreements in effect prior to 2009. All award agreements also provide for vesting of unvested RSUs in the discretion of, and subject to approval by, the Compensation Committee, in the event of the "Retirement" (as defined in the award agreement) of the subject executive officer. 
The Compensation Committee's determination in February 2019 to grant RSUs under the annual equity grant program to each NEO was in keeping with its annual practice of using RSUs as part of the compensation program and was based on the Committee's determination that an annual grant of RSUs fosters the equivalent of stock ownership by the Company's executive officers, thereby aligning their personal interests with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders, and also encourages executive retention because the awards vest over a five-year period.   The size of the annual equity award granted to each NEO is commensurate with the role and responsibilities of such NEO and with historical trends. 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved RSU grants to the NEOs in accordance with its annual equity grant program, based on each NEO's individual performance during 2018 and in furtherance of the overall goals of Getty's executive compensation program as described above, in the following amounts: 22,500 RSUs to Mr. Constant, 16,500 RSUs to Mr. Olear, 16,500 RSUs to Mr. Dicker, and 11,000 RSUs to Mr. Fielding. These RSU grants will be reflected in the "2019 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table that will be included in our Proxy Statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020. All such RSU grants include related dividend equivalents. 
Retirement Plans 
Getty has a retirement and profit sharing plan with 401(k) deferred savings plan provisions (the "Retirement Plan") for employees, including our NEOs, meeting certain service requirements. An annual discretionary profit sharing contribution to the Retirement Plan is determined by the Board of Directors. The contribution is calculated as a percentage of the sum of (i) the employee's compensation (as defined in the Retirement Plan) up to the maximum allowed under Internal Revenue Service regulations, and (ii) the excess of that amount over the social security taxable wage base. For 2018, the Board of Directors elected to contribute 1% of that sum for each eligible employee. This percentage was consistent with prior years. Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, the Company matches 50% of each participating employee's elective contribution to the Retirement Plan, but in no event more than 3% of the employee's compensation. The Company's contributions to the Retirement Plan vest in accordance with a six-year vesting schedule and are paid upon retirement, death, disability, or termination of employment, as described more fully in the Retirement Plan. 
Getty also has the Supplemental Retirement Plan for NEOs and other senior management employees. The Board of Directors has sole discretion to select annually the eligible employees for whom contributions will be made. Under the Supplemental Retirement Plan, which is not qualified for purposes of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, a participating employee may receive in his trust account an amount equal to 10% of his compensation (as defined in the Supplemental Retirement Plan), reduced by the amount of any contributions allocated to the employee by the Company under the Retirement Plan. The amounts held in trust under the Supplemental Retirement Plan may be used to satisfy claims of general creditors in the event of bankruptcy of Getty or any of its subsidiaries. An employee's account vests in the same manner as under the Retirement Plan and is paid upon separation of service from the Company. Under the Supplemental Retirement Plan, during any year, the Board of Directors may elect not to make any payment to the account of any or all eligible employees. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
Effective as of February 26, 2019, the Company has adopted an Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy (the "Policy") that prohibits employees (including our executive officers) and directors from (i) engaging in any short sales (including short sales "against the box"), transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities involving the Company's securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market, or hedging transactions and (ii) holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. The only exception to the Policy is the currently outstanding pledge by Mr. Liebowitz of 1,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock as security for an $8.5 million loan with UBS, which was excepted from the Policy after consideration by the Board of Directors because such pledge existed prior to the adoption of the Policy.  Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, and based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement for filing with the SEC and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(1)   Stock awards are in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs). The amount reflected is the grant date fair  value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The value of future dividends is assumed to be reflected in the closing per share price of the common stock, and, consequently, in the fair value of each award. Therefore, the dividend  equivalents paid on RSUs are not shown separately in this table. The Company pays dividend equivalents on RSUs only to the extent dividends are declared on shares of its common stock.  
(2)   All Other Compensation includes (a) profit sharing and Company matching contributions under the  Retirement Plan, (b) contributions under the Supplemental Retirement Plan, (c) life insurance premiums, and (d) perquisites and other personal benefits received by the NEOs that exceeded $10,000 in the aggregate for the year, which  consist only of automobile allowances.

 2018 Compensation Disclosure Ratio of the Median Annual Total Compensation of All Company Employees to the Annual Total Compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer 
Mr. Christopher J. Constant, who serves as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, had fiscal 2018 total compensation of $1,333,951, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. We estimate that the median annual compensation for all employees of the Company, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, was $191,473 for 2018. As a result, Mr. Constant's 2018 annual compensation was approximately seven (7) times that of the median annual compensation for all employees. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows: 
(1) We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of 29 individuals other than Mr. Constant. We selected December 31, 2018, which is within the last three months of 2018, as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee." 
(2) We identified our median employee based on the annual total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. We note that the median employee is the same individual we identified for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, for purposes of reporting the ratio of annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee, both the Chief Executive Officer and the median employee's total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. The Company has not made any of the adjustments permissible by the SEC, nor have any material assumptions or estimates been made to identify the median employee or to determine annual total compensation. Pay ratios that are reported by our peers may not be directly comparable to ours because of differences in the composition of each company's workforce, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used in calculating the pay ratio, as permitted by SEC rules.

Director Compensation 
The following text and table discuss the compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors for 2018: 
For 2018, (i) all non-employee directors other than Ms. Malanoski received an annual director fee of $30,000, which included attendance at all meetings of our Board of Directors; (ii) Ms. Malanoski received a director fee of $7,500, which included attendance at the one meeting of our Board of Directors that she was eligible to attend; (ii) Members of our Audit Committee received an annual fee of $12,500, except for (a) the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who received an annual fee of $20,000, and (b) Ms. Malanoski, who received a pro-rated annual fee of $3,125, each of which included attendance at all meetings of our Audit Committee that he or she was eligible to attend; (iii) Members of our Compensation Committee received an annual fee of $5,000, except for the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, who received an annual fee of $7,500, which included attendance at all meetings of our Compensation Committee; and (iv) Members of our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received an annual fee of $5,000, except for the Chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, who received an annual fee of $7,500, which included attendance at all meetings of our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. In addition, Mr. Safenowitz received a fee of $50,000 for his services as Lead Independent Director. All annual fees payable to directors are paid in four equal quarterly installments. 
Non-employee directors are also reimbursed for travel and other expenses related to Company business. 
Mr. Liebowitz has served as our Chairman of the Board since 1971 and continues to do so. Mr. Liebowitz retired as an employee of the Company on June 28, 2013. For 2018, Mr. Liebowitz received an annual fee of $125,000 (paid quarterly) for his services as Chairman of the Board, in addition to the annual director fee of $30,000 paid to all directors, as noted above. Mr. Constant is not separately compensated for his services on the Board; his compensation for services as an employee is discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section on page 17 of this Proxy Statement.  Generally, to better align the interests of our non-employee directors with the interests of the Company's stockholders, the Compensation Committee grants equity-based awards under the 2004 Plan to the Company's non-employee directors consisting of RSUs (including dividend equivalents paid with respect to such RSUs). RSU awards vest over a five-year period. RSUs granted before 2009 provide for settlement upon termination of service as a director and RSUs granted in 2009 and thereafter provide for settlement upon the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the grant date (or the tenth anniversary of the first vesting date, for RSUs granted in 2016-2018), or upon termination of service as a director. The award agreements also provide for optional vesting of a director's RSUs in the event of the "Retirement" (as defined in the award agreement) of the subject non-employee director, if approved by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a grant of 6,000 RSUs to each of the non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee's determination to award RSUs was in order to further align the interests of directors with the Company's stockholders and also to provide additional value to directors for their contributions to the Company. In connection with her appointment as a director of the Company in October 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 3,000 RSUs to Ms. Malanoski.

(1)  The Company granted 6,000 RSUs to each non-employee director in 2018,  except for Ms. Malanoski, who was granted 3,000 RSUs in connection with her appointment as a director in October 2018. The fair value of these RSUs was determined based on the closing market price of Getty's stock on the date of grant  without consideration of the five-year vesting period of the restricted stock award. These RSUs provide for settlement, to the extent vested, upon the earlier of the tenth anniversary of the date of grant (or the tenth anniversary of the first  vesting date, for RSUs granted in 2016-2018), or the termination of service from the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2018, Messrs. Cooper, Coviello, Liebowitz and Safenowitz each had 30,500 vested and 16,000 unvested RSUs outstanding, of  which, in each case, 4,800 RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, Mr. Montag had 25,500 vested and 16,000 unvested RSUs outstanding, of which 4,800 RSUs vested during the year ended  December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, Ms. Malanoski had 3,000 unvested RSUs outstanding.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The members of the Compensation Committee for calendar year 2018 were Messrs. Cooper, Coviello, Montag and Safenowitz. There were no Compensation Committee interlocks to report in 2018.  PROPOSAL NO. 2 
ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE 
ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY-ON-PAY) 
(Item No.  2 on the Proxy Card) 
Background 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, requires that our stockholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation, commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" vote. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting will be necessary to approve the advisory vote on executive compensation. For purposes of the advisory vote to approve the Named Executive Officer compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
The advisory vote on executive compensation is a non-binding vote on the compensation of our NEOs as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the tabular disclosure regarding such compensation, and the accompanying narrative disclosure, set forth in this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section starts on page 17 of this Proxy Statement. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section which provides a detailed discussion of our executive compensation program and compensation philosophy, including information about 2018 compensation of our NEOs. This advisory vote on executive compensation is not a vote on our general compensation policies, the compensation of our Board, or our compensation policies as they relate to risk management. 
The vote solicited by this Proposal No. 2 is advisory and, therefore, is not binding on the Company, our Board or our Compensation Committee. The outcome of the vote will not require the Company, our Board or our Compensation Committee to take any action and will not be construed as overruling any decision by the Company, our Board or our Compensation Committee. Furthermore, because this non-binding, advisory vote primarily relates to the compensation of our NEOs that has already been paid or contractually committed, there is generally no opportunity for us to revisit these decisions. However, our Board, including our Compensation Committee, values the opinions of our stockholders, and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and evaluate what actions, if any, may be appropriate to address those concerns. Stockholders will be asked at the Annual Meeting to approve the following resolution pursuant to this Proposal No. 2: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Getty Realty Corp. approve, on an advisory basis, the Named Executive Officer compensation. 
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "for" approval of the foregoing resolution. Proxies will be so voted unless stockholders specify otherwise in their proxies.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
To Our Stockholders: 
This report addresses our compliance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") designed to enhance audit committee effectiveness to improve public disclosure about the functioning of corporate audit committees and to enhance the reliability and credibility of financial statements of public companies. 
Oversight Responsibilities 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Getty Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), is responsible for providing objective oversight of the Company's financial accounting and reporting functions, system of internal control and audit process. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Audit Committee's Charter is available on the Company's website located at www.gettyrealty.com and is available in print to any shareholder who requests it. 
The Company's management is responsible for the Company's system of internal control and its financial reporting process. The independent registered public accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are responsible for performing an independent integrated audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for the monitoring and oversight of these processes. 
Independence/Qualifications 
The Board of Directors determined that for the year ended December 31, 2018 each member of the Audit Committee was "independent", as such term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE, and that each member who served on the Audit Committee for 2018 is "financially literate", as such term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board also determined that for the year ended December 31, 2018, Ms. Malanoski and Messrs. Coviello and Montag each qualified as an "audit committee financial expert" under the relevant rules of the SEC and each had the requisite accounting/financial management expertise required by the listing standards of the NYSE. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 
During the past year, the Audit Committee met regularly with management to assure that the Company's internal control over financial reporting continued to meet applicable standards under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are compliant with the listing standards of the NYSE. The Company's internal control over financial reporting was reviewed and tested by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent auditors. Their report is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. At the Audit Committee meeting held on February 26, 2019, the Committee reviewed the Company's internal control over financial reporting with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and determined that the Company is in compliance with the requirements applicable to it. 
Financial Statements 
With regard to our audited financial statements, the Audit Committee has: 
(1) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP; 
(2) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP those matters required to be discussed under PCAOB standards, including those required by Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees);  (3) (a) received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and (b) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP their independence; and 
(4) based upon the review and discussions set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, it was recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. 
Prior to the filing with the SEC of each of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2018, the Audit Committee Chairman or another member of the Audit Committee reviewed with the Company's management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the Company's interim financial results to be included in such reports and the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301. 
The report of the Audit Committee should not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating this Proxy Statement by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and should not otherwise be deemed filed under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

 PROPOSAL NO. 3 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT 
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
(Item No. 3 on the Proxy Card) 
On February 26, 2019, the Audit Committee appointed the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), subject to ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting, to audit the accounts of Getty with respect to our operations for the year ending December 31, 2019 and to perform such other services as may be required. Should PwC be unable to perform these services for any reason, the Audit Committee will appoint another independent registered public accounting firm to perform these services. As long as a quorum is present, a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting is necessary to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policy requires pre-approval of services to be provided by PwC. The policy authorizes the Audit Committee to delegate to one or more of its members, and the Audit Committee has delegated to each of its members, authority to pre-approve non-audit services. Each member is required to report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the non-audit services performed by PwC in 2017 and 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
The fees payable to PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm, related to services provided for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 were as follows:

Representatives of the firm of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "for" the proposal to ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  DEADLINES FOR SUBMITTING STOCKHOLDER NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR AND OTHER 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
Stockholder proposals to be considered for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received by November 15, 2019. Any stockholder proposal or director nomination to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting that is not intended to be included in next year's Proxy Statement will be considered untimely if we receive it before January 31, 2020 or after March 1, 2020. Such proposals and nominations also must be made in accordance with our Bylaws. An untimely proposal may be excluded from consideration at the 2020 annual meeting. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules issued thereunder, Getty's officers and directors are required to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of Getty equity securities with the SEC and the NYSE. As a matter of practice, our administrative staff assists our executive officers and directors in preparing initial ownership reports and reporting ownership changes, and typically files those reports on their behalf. Based solely on a review of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the SEC during 2018 and written representations provided by our directors and officers, Getty believes that during 2018 all of our officers and directors complied with the Section  16(a) requirements. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Management does not know of any matters, other than those referred to above, to be presented at the meeting for action by the stockholders. However, if any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, or any adjournment or adjournments or postponements thereof, we intend to cast votes pursuant to the proxies with respect to such matters in accordance with the best judgment of the persons acting under the proxies. 
Record holders may vote by returning the enclosed proxy card by mail or by attending the meeting and voting in person. The Notice of Internet Availability also instructs you how you may submit your proxy over the internet. If your shares are held in "street name", which means they are held for your benefit in the name of a broker, bank or other intermediary, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other intermediary on how you can indicate the votes you wish to cast with respect to your shares. Please be aware that beneficial owners of shares held in "street name" may not vote their shares in person at the meeting unless they first obtain a written authorization to do so from their broker, bank or other intermediary and produce same at the Annual Meeting. Your proxy may be revoked at any time prior to it being exercised. Record holders may revoke their proxy by voting at the meeting or by submitting a new proxy, dated after the date of the proxy to be revoked, to the Secretary of the Company at the address on the first page of this Proxy Statement, prior to the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in "street name", you must contact your broker, bank or other intermediary for instructions on revoking your proxy. Brokerage houses and other custodians will be requested to forward solicitation material to beneficial owners of stock that they hold of record. We will reimburse brokerage houses, banks and custodians for their out of pocket expenses in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners. The cost of this solicitation, which will be effected by mail, will be borne by us.
