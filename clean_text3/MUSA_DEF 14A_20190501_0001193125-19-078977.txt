Cast Your Vote Right Away 
It is very important that you vote. Please cast your vote right away on all of the proposals listed above to ensure that your shares are represented. For specific instructions on how to vote your shares, please refer to the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") you received in the mail or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, on your enclosed proxy card. 
Notice and Access 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to be held on May 1, 2019: 
The Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, 2019 Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available, free of charge, at www.proxyvote.com. 
This year, we will be furnishing proxy materials over the internet to a number of our stockholders under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's notice and access rules. Many of our stockholders will receive the Notice in the mail instead of a paper copy of this Proxy Statement, a proxy card or voting instruction card and our 2018 Annual Report. We believe that this process will reduce the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting as well as reduce the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. The Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the internet. 
All stockholders who do not receive the Notice will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail, unless they have previously elected to receive proxy materials by email. We remind stockholders who receive the Notice that the Notice is not itself a proxy card and should not be returned with voting instructions. The Notice only presents an overview of the more complete proxy materials. Stockholders should review the proxy materials before voting. 
The Notice contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials and vote over the internet at www.proxyvote.com and how stockholders can receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement, a proxy card or voting instruction card and our 2018 Annual Report. At www.proxyvote.com, stockholders can also request to receive future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email.

Proxy Statement 
Solicitation 
The solicitation of the enclosed proxy is made on behalf of the Board of Directors of Murphy USA Inc. (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 1, 2019 and Murphy USA will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. It is expected that the Notice will be mailed to stockholders beginning on or about March 19, 2019. 
The complete mailing address of the Company's principal executive office is 200 Peach Street, El Dorado, Arkansas 71730. 
References in this Proxy Statement to "we," "us," "our," "the Company" and "Murphy USA" refer to Murphy USA Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Quorum and Voting Procedures 
Quorum Requirement 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present for establishing a quorum. A "broker non-vote" occurs on a proposal when shares held by brokers or nominees who do not have discretionary power to vote on a non-routine matter and to whom voting instructions have not been given from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote. 
Vote Necessary to Approve Proposals 
General 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the meeting will be counted by the persons appointed by the Company to act as Judges of Election for the Annual Meeting. The Judges of Election will treat shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the outcome of any other business submitted at the meeting to the stockholders for a vote. 
Your proxy will be voted at the meeting, unless you (i) revoke it at any time before the vote by filing a revocation with the Secretary of the Company, (ii) duly execute a proxy card bearing a later date, or (iii) appear at the meeting and vote in person. Proxies returned to the Company, votes cast other than in person and written revocations will be disqualified if received after commencement of the meeting. If you elect to vote your proxy by telephone or internet as described in the telephone/internet voting instructions on your proxy card, the Company will vote your shares as you direct. Your telephone/internet vote authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had marked, signed and returned your proxy card. 
Proposal 1 – Election of Three Class III Directors Whose Current Terms Expire on the Date of the 2019 Annual Meeting 
The Class III directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting so long as a quorum is present. Under this standard, you may either vote in favor of all Class III directors, or withhold on all Class III directors or a particular Class III director. If you do not vote, you will have no impact on the calculation of "votes cast." "Broker non-votes" and votes that are withheld will not count as a vote cast and will likewise have no effect. Unless specification to the contrary is made, the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted FOR all the director nominees. 
All Other Proposals 
For Proposals 2 and 3, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our capital stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required for approval. You may vote "for," "against" or "abstain" on these matters. If you vote to "abstain," it will have the same effect as a vote "against." "Broker non-votes" are not counted as shares present or represented and voting and have no effect on the vote. Unless specification to the contrary is made, the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted FOR the approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (on an advisory, non-binding basis) and FOR approval of the action of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in appointing KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Broker Voting 
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record (a "nominee"), you will receive instructions from the nominee that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted. Certain of these institutions offer telephone and internet voting. Under current New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, the proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year should be considered a routine matter. However, for purposes of determining the outcome of any non-routine matter as to which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote, those shares will be treated as not present and not entitled to vote with respect to that matter. Notably, Proposals 1 and 2 should be considered non-routine matters and your broker is not permitted to vote your shares without your instructions and such uninstructed shares are considered "broker non-votes." 
Voting Securities 
On March 4, 2019, the record date for the meeting, the Company had 32,183,509 shares of common stock outstanding, all of one class and each share having one vote with respect to all matters to be voted on at the meeting. Information as to common stock ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is set forth in the tables under "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners" and "Security Ownership of Directors and Management" included on page 13 in this Proxy Statement.

Proposal 1 – Election of Three Class III Directors Whose Current Terms Expire on the Date of the Annual Meeting 
The Board recognizes that it is important for the Company's directors to possess a diverse array of backgrounds and skills, whether in terms of executive management leadership, public company experience or educational achievement. When considering new candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee, with input from the Board, will seek to ensure the Board reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, diversity and expertise, particularly in the areas of accounting and finance, management, government/regulation, leadership and convenience store and other retail-related industries, sufficient to provide sound and prudent guidance with respect to our operations and interests. In addition, although it does not have a separate policy with respect to diversity, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the issue of diversity among the factors used to identify nominees for directors. The goal is to assemble and maintain a Board comprised of individuals that not only possess a high level of business acumen, but who also demonstrate a commitment to the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in carrying out the Board's responsibilities with respect to oversight of the Company's operations. 
To the extent authorized by the proxies, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted in favor of the election of the three nominees for director whose names are set forth below. If for any reason any of these nominees is not a candidate when the election occurs, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted for the election of the other nominees named and may be voted for any substituted nominees or the Board size may be reduced. 
All directors, other than Mr. Clyde (our President and Chief Executive Officer), were determined to be independent by the Board based on the rules of the NYSE and the standards of independence included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. As part of its independence recommendation to the Board, the Nominating and 
 Governance Committee at its February meeting considered familial relationships of certain directors (Mr. Murphy and Mr. Deming are first cousins). 
Mr. Murphy became the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board in connection with the spin-off of the Company from Murphy Oil Corporation (the "Spin-Off"), which was completed on August 30, 2013. As an independent chairman, he leads our regularly scheduled meetings of independent directors, held outside the presence of Company management. These meetings occur at four Board meetings each year. 
Stockholders and other interested parties may send communications to the Board, specified individual directors and the independent directors as a group c/o the Secretary, Murphy USA Inc., 200 Peach Street, El Dorado, AR 71730-5836. Communications will be kept confidential and forwarded to the specified director(s). Items that are unrelated to a director's duties and responsibilities as a Board member, such as junk mail, may be excluded by the Secretary. The names and relevant detail of the nominees are as follows: 
Director Nominees 
Our Board is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms. Messrs. Murphy, Clyde and Miller, who are Class III directors, are nominated for re-election at this Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Class I and Class II directors will serve until our annual meetings of stockholders in 2020 and 2021, respectively. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors will be elected for three-year terms to succeed the class of directors whose terms have expired. This section details the name, age, class, qualifications and committee memberships of our directors as of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Board and Governance Matters 
Board Leadership Structure 
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Murphy USA are held by two individuals. Mr. Murphy serves as our Chairman of the Board as a non-executive and independent director. Mr. Clyde serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and also serves as a director. Along with Mr. Murphy and Mr. Clyde, other directors bring different perspectives and roles to the Company's management, oversight and strategic development. The Company's directors bring experience and expertise from both inside and outside the Company and industry, while the President and Chief Executive Officer is most familiar with the Company's business and industry, most involved in the Company's day-to-day operations and most capable of leading the execution of the Company's strategy. The Board believes that having separate roles of Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of stockholders because it facilitates independent oversight of management. 
Risk Management 
Our Company's management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks to the Company. The Board of Directors has broad oversight responsibility for our risk management programs. 
The Board of Directors exercises risk management oversight and control both directly and indirectly, the latter through various board committees as discussed below. The Board of Directors regularly reviews information regarding the Company's credit, liquidity and operations, including the risks associated with each. The Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company's executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of financial risks and the ethical conduct of the Company's business, including the steps the Company has taken to monitor and mitigate these risks. The Nominating and Governance Committee, in its role of reviewing and maintaining the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of these risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through committee reports and by the President and Chief Executive Officer about the known risks to the strategy and the business. 
Committees 
Our Board of Directors has established several standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. The following table presents the standing committees of the Board and the current membership of the committees and the number of times each committee met in 2018.

No person who served as a member of the Executive Compensation Committee was, during 2018, an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or had any relationship requiring disclosure in this Proxy Statement. None of our executive officers serve as a member of a board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve on our Board of Directors or Executive Compensation Committee.

In 2018, the cash component consisted of: 
All elements of cash components are paid in quarterly installments. The Company also reimburses directors for travel, lodging and other related expenses they incur in attending Board and Committee meetings. 
In addition to the cash component, the non-employee directors also receive an annual grant of time-based restricted stock units which vest after three years. Each non-employee director received a restricted stock unit grant with a target value of $117,500 on February 8, 2018.

The Company will contribute to qualified educational institutions and hospitals in an amount equal to twice the amount contributed by the eligible person. The Company will contribute to qualified welfare and cultural organizations in an amount equal to the contribution made by the eligible person. 
Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board of Directors has also established stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors of the Company. Directors are expected to achieve ownership of at least three times the annual cash retainer within five years of service. A director may not pledge Company securities either by purchasing Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account, until he or she has achieved the applicable stock ownership target specified in the guidelines above. These guidelines are designed to ensure that directors display confidence in the Company through the ownership of a significant amount of our stock. At December 31, 2018, all of our Directors had met or were on track to comply with these stock ownership guidelines within the applicable five-year period. 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews ordinary course of business transactions with firms associated with directors and nominees for director. The Company's management also monitors these transactions on an ongoing basis. Executive officers and directors are governed by the Company's written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides that waivers may only be granted by the Board of Directors or a Board committee and must be promptly disclosed to stockholders. No such waivers were granted nor applied for in fiscal 2018. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that all directors recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business or professional interests. 
Audit Committee Report 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of Murphy USA's financial statements, for its accounting and financial reporting principles and for the establishment and effectiveness of internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), expressing an opinion as to the conformity of such financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Board and Governance Matters (continued) 
The Audit Committee is also directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of Murphy USA's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's charter is available in the Corporate Governance section of Murphy USA's corporate website at ir.corporate.murphyusa.com. 
The Audit Committee held seven meetings during 2018. The Audit Committee Chair and members of the Audit Committee also held numerous additional meetings throughout 2018 with members of Murphy USA corporate, business segment and internal audit management and with Murphy USA's independent registered public accounting firm (KPMG LLP). The Committee believes that these meetings were helpful in discharging its oversight responsibilities, including with respect to financial reporting and disclosure, risk management and internal controls. 
Independence 
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are independent, as required by NYSE listing standards and SEC rules. 
Expertise 
The Board of Directors has also determined, on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, that all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and have accounting or related financial management expertise, each as defined by NYSE listing standards. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Murphy have been designated as the "audit committee financial experts", as defined under SEC rules. The Audit Committee's assistance in the Board of Directors' oversight of Murphy USA's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements primarily focuses on the effect of such matters on Murphy USA's financial statements, financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting. 
Audited Financial Statements 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has considered and discussed the 2018 audited financial statements with management and KPMG LLP, including a discussion of the quality, and not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, clarity of the disclosures and the condition of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has reviewed with the Head of Internal Audit and the KPMG LLP engagement team the scope and plans for their respective audits and has met with each of the Head of Internal Audit and the senior engagement partner of KPMG LLP, with and without management present, to discuss audit results, their evaluations of Murphy USA's internal controls and the overall quality of Murphy USA's financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees." Finally, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP as required by the PCAOB's rules regarding Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence and has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. 
Conclusion 
Based upon the reports and discussion described in this report, the Audit Committee, in accordance with its responsibilities, recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board approved, inclusion of the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Murphy USA's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Proposal 2 – Approval of Executive Compensation on an Advisory, Non-Binding Basis 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act") enables the Company's stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. 
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Company's executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain the Named Executive Officers, who are critical to the Company's success. Under these programs, the Named Executive Officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, corporate goals and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" along with the information in the compensation tables for additional details about the executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of the Named Executive Officers. 
Stockholders are asked to indicate their support for the Named Executive Officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the Named Executive Officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Stockholders are requested to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures." 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Executive Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors and the Executive Compensation Committee value the opinions of stockholders and will consider stockholders' views and the Executive Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those views. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

The Executive Compensation Committee (referred to as the "Committee" in this section) bases its executive compensation decisions on principles designed to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. The Committee believes compensation should provide a direct link with the Company's values, objectives, business strategies and financial results. In order to motivate, attract, and retain key executives who are critical to its long-term success, the Company aims to provide pay packages that are competitive with others in the retail industry. In addition, the Company believes that executives should be rewarded for both the short- and long-term success of the Company and, conversely, be subject to a degree of downside risk in the event that the Company does not achieve its performance objectives. 
Aligning Pay with Performance 
The Committee believes our compensation programs provide for a strong "pay for performance" linkage between the compensation provided to our executives and the Company's performance relative to its peers. Consistent with the fundamental principle that compensation programs should pay for performance, the Company's 2018 performance directly impacted compensation decisions and pay outcomes. Annual incentives for NEOs were earned at 137.6% of target, reflecting the Company's 2018 performance relative to predefined targets. See pages 21-23 for additional information. Performance stock units ("PSUs") linked to the Company's performance for the three-year period ended in 2018 were earned at 165.0% of target. See page 24 for additional information. 
We view performance in two ways: (1) the Company's operating performance, including results against short- and long-term growth targets; and (2) return to stockholders over time, both on an absolute basis and relative to other companies, including both our peers and the S&P 500.

2018 Business Highlights 
We measure our operating performance relative to the execution of a proven strategy that reflects five coherent themes that leverage our differentiated strengths and capabilities. This "5-Point Strategy" supports a business model which is both enduring in a highly volatile industry and hard to replicate by competitors. Our strategy creates a unique way to compete for customers, workforce talent, supplier-partner support and stockholder capital. We take none of these stakeholders for granted and our goal is to create sustained value for all of them while making a positive impact in the communities we serve. Highlighted accomplishments among the 5-Point Strategy for 2018 include:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Return to Stockholders 
The Company has delivered consistent returns to our stockholders over the past three years. Following the completion of a $250 million share repurchase program in 2015, we announced an additional $500 million share repurchase program in January 2016, which was completed in 2018. Our three-year annualized total shareholder return (TSR) for the period ending December 31, 2018 of over 6% outpaced the median TSR of our peer group (discussed in the "Role of Market Data" section included on page 19 in this Proxy Statement). 
Annualized Total Shareholder Return 
Reported and Realized Pay 
Since a majority of reported pay for our Chief Executive Officer represents potential pay, we also consider pay actually realized each year. The following graph shows reported pay included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 27 as compared to realized pay during 2018. 
Reported and Realized Compensation for the CEO 
(Amounts in $ millions) 
The realized pay data shown above include the value of options exercised and restricted stock unit ("RSU") and PSU awards which vested (earned in the case of the PSUs) during the applicable year. Note that for Mr. Clyde, no options were exercised in 2016 or 2017. 
In 2018, Mr. Clyde exercised options totaling nearly $7.7 million as a result of Murphy USA's stock price more than doubling since the spin off. Of that amount, roughly $5.4 million was related to options issued by Murphy Oil prior to the spin off which were inherited by Murphy USA. Prior to their exercise, Mr. Clyde held the options for roughly five years of the seven-year term. In addition, PSUs were earned at 165.0% of target for the 2016-2018 performance period. When combined with stock price appreciation since grant ($80.00 vs. $59.11), the value of PSUs increased significantly, supporting our pay for performance philosophy. 
2018 "Say-on-Pay" Vote Result 
In May 2014, stockholders approved an annual frequency for Say-on-Pay votes. The Committee carefully considered the results of our Say-on-Pay vote on NEO compensation in May 2018, in which 97.5% of the advisory votes cast were in support of the Company's Say-on-Pay

proposal and executive compensation programs for our NEOs as described in our 2018 Proxy Statement. The Committee interpreted this level of support as affirmation by our stockholders of the design and overall execution of our executive compensation programs. 
Throughout the past year, the Company engaged in dialogue with our largest stockholders about various corporate governance topics, including executive compensation. The Company values these discussions and encourages our stockholders to provide feedback about our executive compensation programs. 
Based on the results of the 2018 vote and our ongoing dialogue with our stockholders, as well as a consideration of evolving best practices, the Committee continues to examine our compensation programs to ensure alignment with stockholder interests remains strong. 
Compensation Design Principals and Governance Practices 
The Committee intends for its compensation design principles to protect and promote our stockholders' interests. We believe our compensation programs are consistent with best practices for sound corporate governance. 
We Do 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  Pay for performance  a large majority of compensation is performance-based and not  guaranteed  
 ✓  Mitigate undue business risk in compensation programs and perform an annual compensation risk assessment   
 ✓  Utilize an independent compensation consultant  
 ✓  Provide modest perquisites  
 ✓  Maintain stock ownership guidelines and restrict pledging  
 ✓  Prohibit hedging transactions by executives  
 ✓  Include clawbacks in our annual and long-term incentive plans  
[END TABLE]
We Do Not 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 û  Maintain employment contracts  
 û  Maintain separate  change-in-control ("CIC") agreements other than with the CEO  
 û  Provide excise tax gross-ups on CIC benefits

Role of the Committee 
The Committee has responsibility for discharging the Board of Directors' responsibilities with respect to compensation of the Company's executives. In particular, the Committee annually reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, evaluates the CEO's performance in light of those goals and objectives, and determines and approves the CEO's compensation based on this evaluation. In doing so, the Committee reviews all elements of the CEO's compensation. The Committee also approves executive compensation for the Company's executive officers, approves and administers incentive compensation and equity-based plans, and monitors compliance of directors and executive officers with Company stock ownership requirements. Pursuant to its charter, the Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate compensation consultants as well as internal and external legal, accounting, and other advisors, including sole authority to approve the advisors' fees and other engagement terms. For additional information on the responsibilities of the Committee, see the "Committees–Executive Compensation Committee" section included on page 10 in this Proxy Statement. 
Role of Market Data 
The Committee adopted a peer group for purposes of reviewing and approving 2018 compensation. Due to the relatively small number of publicly-traded retail convenience store competitors, the group was broadened to include other companies in similar industries with which Murphy USA competes for executive talent in order to create a sufficient sample of companies against which compensation can be compared. The peer group was developed based on certain attributes including: 
The peer group consists of the following companies:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Base salaries and total target direct compensation for the Company's NEOs were compared to the median of the market data to determine whether the Company's compensation practices were in alignment with market pay levels. When making compensation-related decisions, the Committee aims to set compensation levels for executive officers based on a deliberate review of market compensation for a particular position as well as each individual's possession of a unique skill or knowledge set, proven leadership capabilities or experience and Company performance. Based on such factors, the Committee may determine with respect to one or more individuals that it is appropriate for compensation to meet, exceed, or fall below the median of the market data for a particular compensation element or total compensation. 
Role of the CEO in Compensation Decisions 
The CEO periodically reviews the performance of each of the NEOs, excluding himself, develops preliminary recommendations regarding salary adjustments and annual and long-term award amounts, and provides recommendations to the Committee. The Committee can exercise its discretion to modify any recommendations and make final decisions. 
Elements of Compensation 
Our compensation program is comprised of three key components, each designed to be market-competitive and to help attract, motivate, retain and reward our NEOs.

The majority of our NEO compensation is performance-based and is issued in the form of both short- and long-term incentives. Individuals in a position to influence the growth of stockholder value have larger portions of their total compensation delivered in the form of equity-based long-term incentives. The target mix of the elements of the compensation program for the CEO and other NEOs is shown in the following chart which outlines the size, in percentage terms, of each element of target compensation.

A.    Base Salary 
Base salary is designed to provide a competitive fixed rate of pay recognizing each employee's level of responsibility and performance. In setting base salary levels for NEOs, the Committee considers competitive market data in addition to other factors such as duties and responsibilities, experience, individual performance, retention concerns, internal equity considerations, Company performance, general economic conditions and marketplace compensation trends. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually. In 2018, the Committee adjusted salaries awarded to each NEO to bring salaries closer to competitive market levels for similar positions. The following table shows the base salaries for each of the NEOs effective February 1, 2017 and February 1, 2018:

[END TABLE]
B.    Annual Incentive Plan 
We provide annual incentives for our executive officers through our stockholder-approved Murphy USA Inc. 2013 Annual Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective as of February 7, 2019 (the "AIP"). The primary objective of the AIP is to align corporate and individual goals with stockholder interests and Company strategy and to reward employees for their performance relative to those goals. Murphy USA targets the median of market pay levels for annual target incentive compensation. Executives have the opportunity to be compensated above the median of market pay levels when Murphy USA outperforms established performance measures. 
Target bonus opportunities under the AIP are expressed as a percentage of annualized base salary. The Committee reviews market data annually with respect to competitive pay levels and sets specific bonus opportunities for each of our NEOs. The following table shows target bonuses as a percentage of salary in effect for each of the NEOs in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name   Title     Target Bonus as a% of Salary

[END TABLE]
Each NEO's actual AIP bonus payment is determined by multiplying their target bonus amount by the corporate performance weighted performance score, as described below. The Committee may then exercise negative discretion to reduce an NEO's bonus payout based on subjective individual criteria. The NEO's actual AIP bonus payment may not exceed 200% of their target amount, which reflects the maximum weighted performance score that may be achieved. 
2018 Corporate Performance 
For 2018, as in 2016 and 2017, the AIP metrics for the Company consisted of return on average capital employed ("ROACE"), profitability as measured by Fuel Cash Breakeven and corporate goals and objectives ("Corporate Goals") outlined below. All participants, including our NEOs, were subject to the same performance metrics with the same Threshold, Target and Maximum levels for each metric. Under

 the terms of the AIP, achievement of 100% of the Target for ROACE or Fuel Cash Breakeven results in the payment of 100% of target for that metric. Achievement of the Threshold level of the performance range for ROACE or Fuel Cash Breakeven results in the payment of 50% of target and achievement of the Maximum level of performance for ROACE or Fuel Cash Breakeven results in the payment of 200% of target. No awards are payable for ROACE or Fuel Cash Breakeven if performance for that metric falls below the Threshold achievement level. Results between points are interpolated. The Committee believes the combination of these metrics reflected the overall key goals and objectives for the Company for 2018. 
For 2018, the AIP metrics were achieved at 137.6% of Target (112.0% of Target for ROACE; 172.0% of Target for Fuel Cash Breakeven; and 120.0% of Target for the Corporate Goals), as described in more detail below. 
The following table summarizes the ROACE, Fuel Cash Breakeven and Corporate Goals performance metrics and corresponding weightings used in determining annual incentive award payouts for our NEOs and the weighted performance scores for each based on actual performance during 2018:

The Target level goals (shown below) can be characterized as "strong performance," meaning that based on historical performance, although attainment of this performance level is uncertain, it can be reasonably anticipated that Target performance may be achieved, while the Threshold goals are more likely to be achieved and the Maximum goals represent more aggressive levels of performance. The Committee reviewed performance against the Corporate Goals and determined that actual performance resulted in achievement of 120.0% of the Target in aggregate. Actual results achieved versus each of the Corporate Goals is illustrated below:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Individual Performance 
In addition to the corporate performance component, the AIP permits the Committee to exercise negative discretion to reduce an NEO's award based on the Committee's subjective review of his or her performance relative to the achievement of the metrics outlined above, business plan execution and other qualitative results. We believe that it is important to include this component in our AIP in order to take into account NEO performance that, in the Committee's opinion, justifies a reduction in the amount otherwise payable to an NEO based on objective corporate performance. Overall, amounts earned under the AIP cannot exceed 200% of target. In 2018, the Committee believed that our NEOs' individual performance was appropriately reflected in our corporate performance results. Thus, the Committee opted not to make any negative adjustments to the awards earned by our NEOs and payable under the AIP based on our corporate performance. 
Overall Performance and Payouts 
After certifying the results relative to our performance metrics and considering each individual's contributions throughout the year, the Committee approved the following payments for our NEOs for 2018:

C.    Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
We provide share-based, long-term compensation to our executive officers through our stockholder-approved Murphy USA Inc. 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective as of February 9, 2017 (the "LTIP"). Long-term incentive levels for Murphy USA's officers are targeted at the median of competitive market pay levels. The plan provides for a variety of stock and share-based awards, including stock options and RSUs, each of which vests over a period determined by the Committee, as well as PSUs that are earned based on the Company's achievement of two equally-weighted objective performance goals. We believe that these awards create a powerful link between the creation of stockholder value and executive pay delivered. In addition, we believe that the balance between absolute and relative performance achieved through the use of stock options, ROACE-based PSUs and relative TSR-based PSUs is appropriate. In order for executives to fully realize their targeted opportunities, Murphy USA must both successfully achieve its long-term goals and outperform its peers.

Performance Stock Units 
Vesting for 50% of the PSUs will be based on Murphy USA's TSR performance between 2018 and 2020 relative to the Company's peer group. The Committee considers relative TSR an appropriate metric as it aligns the pay for our officers to the appreciation (or reduction) our stockholders receive in their investment in Murphy USA. TSR achievement and corresponding payout levels are as follows:

In February 2019, the Committee certified the performance results for the 2016 PSUs for the three-year performance period that ended December 31, 2018. Under the provisions of these awards, the PSUs were subject to two equally-weighted metrics, ROACE and TSR relative to our peer group. As a result of the Company's strong performance, the PSUs were earned at 165.0% of target. 
The following table summarizes the final performance metrics and corresponding weightings used in determining the number of PSUs earned and the weighted performance scores for each based on actual performance during the three-year period:

D.    Employee Benefits and Perquisites 
Murphy USA's executives are provided usual and customary employee benefits available to all employees (except certain hourly retail employees). These include a qualified defined contribution plan (401(k)) ("Savings Plan"), health insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance and long-term disability insurance. 
The purpose of the Savings Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan, is to provide retirement benefits for all the employees of Murphy USA who participate. All employees are allowed to contribute on a pre-tax basis up to 25 percent of their eligible pay. The Company matches contributions, dollar-for-dollar, up to the first six percent of base pay. Participating employees, including the NEOs, are immediately vested in all employee and Company-matched contributions. 
Murphy USA provides a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("Murphy USA SERP"), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, to eligible executives, including the NEOs. The Murphy USA SERP is intended to restore qualified defined contribution (Savings Plan and profit-sharing) plan benefits restricted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "IRC") to certain highly-compensated individuals. The Company funded the SERP in 2018 through the use of a rabbi trust. The Company's obligations under the SERP are recorded in the financial statements and in the event of the Company's bankruptcy or insolvency, the assets held by the rabbi trust could become subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. 
Murphy USA offers limited perquisites to our NEOs consistent with our peer group. The Board of Directors has authorized up to 50 hours annually of personal use of Company aircraft for our CEO as part of his total compensation package. The value of such personal use is periodically reported to the Committee and will be reported as taxable income to the CEO, with no income tax assistance or gross-ups provided by the Company. 
Reportable values for such personal use is based on the incremental costs to the Company, as provided in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table included on page 27 in this Proxy Statement. 
E.    Discretionary Award 
We maintain the discretion to award additional compensation to our executive officers. In July 2018, we awarded Ms. West a one-time special cash bonus in the amount of $25,000 in recognition of her expanded role as our Executive Vice President, Fuels, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. 
Other Policies 
Severance and Change-in-Control Protection 
The Company has not entered into any employment, CIC or termination agreements with its NEOs, other than with the CEO. 
Mr. Clyde is party to a Severance Protection Agreement (the "SPA"). The SPA provides Mr. Clyde with certain severance benefits if his

If Mr. Clyde's employment is terminated by Murphy USA "without cause" or by Mr. Clyde for "good reason" within this 24-month window, Mr. Clyde will be entitled to his earned but unpaid compensation, a lump-sum severance payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary and the average of his last three annual bonuses prior to the termination date (or, if higher, prior to the CIC), accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity-based awards (provided that any performance-based awards will be paid assuming the target level of performance), and continued life, accident and health insurance benefits for 36 months. Mr. Clyde will not be entitled to any "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up payments. The SPA provides for an excise tax cut back to reduce payments to a level such that the excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC will not apply (unless the executive would receive a greater amount of severance benefits on an after-tax basis without a cutback, in which case the cutback would not apply). Pursuant to the SPA, Mr. Clyde will be subject to a non-disclosure covenant and non-solicitation and non-competition restrictive covenants for 12 months following any such termination. 
Mr. Schofield's employment with the Company ended on July 2, 2018. In consideration of a release of claims against the Company and his agreement to certain restrictive covenants, Mr. Schofield received a cash payment equal to six months of his base salary ($262,500), a lump sum cash payment of $560,000 for transition and advisory services, $3,500 for legal fees, and reimbursement for continuing health insurance premiums under COBRA through June 30, 2019. 
Under the terms of the LTIP, in the event of a CIC, all outstanding equity awards will vest, become immediately exercisable or payable and have all restrictions lifted (any performance-based awards will be paid assuming the target level of performance.). 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To further align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders, the Board of Directors expects all executive officers to display confidence in the Company through the ownership of a significant amount of our stock. Under these guidelines as set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, executive officers, including our NEOs, are expected to hold Murphy USA common stock having a value that is equivalent to a multiple of each executive officer's annualized base salary within five years of assuming their position. The targeted multiples vary among the executives depending upon their position: 
Because the stock ownership guidelines are a multiple of each executive officer's annualized salary, the value that must be maintained will increase proportionally with salary increases. Executive officers are expected to achieve targets within five years of assuming their positions. Shares owned directly by the executive, including RSUs and unrestricted stock units, those owned indirectly, assuming the executive has an economic interest in the shares, and shares held through our employee benefit plans, including the Savings Plan and deferred compensation plan for executives, are included in calculating ownership levels. Shares underlying stock options and unearned PSUs do not count toward the ownership guidelines. At December 31, 2018, all of our NEOs had met or were on track to comply with these stock ownership guidelines within the applicable five-year period. 
Likewise, each member of our Board of Directors is expected to achieve ownership of at least three times their annual cash retainer within five years of service as discussed in the Compensation of Directors section of this Proxy Statement on page 11. As noted above, at December 31, 2018, all of our directors had met or were on track to comply with these stock ownership guidelines within the applicable five-year period. 
The Committee will periodically assess these guidelines, monitor director and executive officer ownership levels relative to these guidelines and make recommendations as appropriate. 
Pledging Policy 
A director or executive officer may not pledge Company securities, either by purchasing Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account, until he or she has achieved the applicable stock ownership target specified in the guidelines above. All of our directors and executive officers are in compliance with our pledging policy. 
Prohibition on Hedging 
To ensure that Murphy USA executive officers, including our NEOs, bear the full risks of Murphy USA common stock ownership, the Company has adopted a policy that prohibits all employees from entering into hedging transactions that are designed to hedge or speculate on any change in the market value of the Company's securities. 
Recoupment and Clawback Policy 
Our officers are subject to recoupment provisions in both the AIP and LTIP programs in the case of certain forfeiture events. If the Company restates its financial statements as a result of negligent, intentional or gross misconduct by the recipient, the Committee may, in its discretion, require that the recipient reimburse the Company with respect to any shares issued or payments made under the AIP or the LTIP in the period covered by the restated financial statements. 
Tax Policy 
Section 162(m) of the IRC generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain NEOs to $1 million annually. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") that was signed into law December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) provided an exception from this

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
 limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation," and the Committee considered the impact of the tax deductibility limitation when making compensation decisions and certain elements of the Company's incentive compensation program were structured to meet this exception. 
The TCJA repealed the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA provides transition relief for certain contractual arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017, if certain requirements are met. The Committee has and will continue to retain the flexibility to design and maintain the executive compensation programs in a manner that is most beneficial to stockholders, including the payment of compensation that is subject to the deduction limits under Section 162(m). 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
The Committee has retained Mercer (US) Inc. ("Mercer") as its independent compensation consultant. Mercer provides executive and director compensation consulting services to the Committee, regularly attends Committee meetings, reports directly to the Committee on matters relating to compensation for our NEOs and participates in executive sessions without management present. Mercer provides advice and analyses to the Committee on the design and level of executive and director compensation. In connection with their services to the Committee, Mercer works with executive management and the corporate human resources team to formalize proposals for the Committee. The Committee has assessed the independence of Mercer pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that Mercer's work for the Committee does not raise any conflicts of interest. 
Compensation-Based Risk Assessment 
In February 2019, the Committee completed a review of the Company's policies and practices of compensating its employees (including non-executives) as they relate to the Company's risk management profile to determine whether these policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. As a result of this review, the Committee concluded that any risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Executive Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on the review and discussions, the Executive Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Proxy Statement.

Executive Compensation (continued) 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or 
Termination in Connection with a Change-in-Control 
The Company does not have employment, CIC or termination agreements with its NEOs other than with the CEO, which was inherited by Murphy USA in connection with the Spin-Off from prior parent Murphy Oil. However, upon a CIC, as defined in the LTIP, all outstanding equity awards granted under such plan shall vest and become immediately exercisable or payable, or have all restrictions lifted that apply to the type of award. Any performance-based awards will be paid at the target level of performance. 
The SPA provides certain severance benefits if Mr. Clyde's employment is terminated within 24 months following a CIC. If his employment is terminated by Murphy USA "without cause" or by Mr. Clyde for "good reason" within this 24-month window, Mr. Clyde will be entitled to his earned but unpaid compensation, a lump-sum severance payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary and the average of his last three annual bonuses prior to the termination date (or, if higher, prior to the CIC), accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity-based awards (provided that any performance-based awards be paid assuming the target level of performance) and continued life, accident and health insurance benefits for 36 months. Mr. Clyde will not be entitled to any "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up payments. The SPA provides for an excise tax cut back to reduce payments to a level such that the excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the IRC will not apply (unless the executive would receive a greater amount of severance benefits on an after-tax basis without a cutback, in which case the cutback will not apply). Pursuant to the SPA, Mr. Clyde will be subject to a non-disclosure covenant and non-solicitation and non-competition restrictive covenants for 12 months following any such termination. 
The Company has no other agreement, contract, plan or arrangement, written or unwritten, that provides for potential payments to any other NEOs upon termination or a CIC, (other than our RSU and PSU agreements that provide for pro-rated vesting upon death, full disability or retirement), with any PSUs eligible to vest remaining subject to actual final performance. 
The following table presents estimated amounts that would have been payable to the applicable NEO if the described event had occurred on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the last fiscal year:

(2)  Non-equity compensation is calculated under the terms of the AIP. Although  actual awards, if any, are subject to attaining certain performance-based targets, for purposes of this table, non-equity compensation is calculated based on actual awards earned in 2018.   
(3)  In the event of a CIC, all unvested outstanding equity awards shall vest, become immediately exercisable or payable or  have all restrictions lifted as may apply to the type of the award. In the event of termination of employment on account of death, disability or retirement, outstanding RSUs and PSUs will vest on a pro-rated  basis, based on the period between the grant date and the termination date. This amount reflects the incremental value of the current unvested outstanding RSUs, PSUs   
(4)  The amount disclosed for Mr. Schofield reflects the amount actually paid to him in connection with his separation  from the Company. Per the separation agreement included as Exhibit 10.2 to Murphy USA's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed August 2, 2018, Mr. Schofield was paid $842,505, including payments  received in consideration of a release of claims against the Company and agreement to certain restrictive covenants, of $262,500 and a lump sum cash payment of $560,000 for transition and advisory services, $3,500 for legal fees, and $16,505  reimbursement for continuing health insurance premiums under COBRA through June 30, 2019. Upon his separation, Mr. Schofield forfeited all outstanding unvested equity awards.

2018 Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Pay Ratio 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (which we collectively refer to as the "Pay Ratio Rule"), we are providing the following estimated information for 2018: 
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
Methodology for Identifying Our "Median Employee" 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer), we first identified our total employee population from which we determined our "median employee". We selected our median employee as of December 31, 
 2018, from our employee population of approximately 9,500 individuals. As a marketer of retail motor fuel products and convenience merchandise through retail stores, over one-half of our employee population on this date was comprised of part-time employees. 
To identify our "median employee" from our total employee population, we compared our employees' total cash compensation for 2018 (which included base wages and any additional cash awards). In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of full-time and part-time employees who were hired in 2018 but did not work for us for the entire fiscal year. We identified our "median employee" using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. 
Determination of Annual Total Compensation of Our "Median Employee" and Our CEO 
Once we identified our "median employee", we then calculated such employee's annual total compensation for 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our NEOs for 2018 (as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 27 of this Proxy Statement). 
Our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 for purposes of the Pay Ratio Rule is equal to the amount reported in the "Total" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

Proposal 3 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2019 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have approved the engagement of KPMG LLP as Murphy USA's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Representatives of that firm are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Ratification of the selection of accountants requires approval by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders of Murphy USA Common Stock, which votes are cast "for" or "against" the ratification. Murphy USA's Board is requesting stockholder ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain KPMG LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of Murphy USA and its stockholders. 
The Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance, and independence of the independent auditor, including the lead partner, on an annual basis (in each case in light of SEC and NYSE independence and other applicable standards then in effect). The Audit Committee ensures the regular rotation of the lead audit partner as required by law and is involved in the selection of the lead audit partner. In addition, the Audit Committee receives periodic reports on the hiring of KPMG LLP partners and other professionals (if hired) to help ensure KPMG LLP satisfies applicable independence rules. 
KPMG LLP has served as Murphy USA's independent registered accounting firm since the spin-off in 2013 and prior to that served as the auditor to Murphy USA's former parent for more than 60 years. KPMG LLP reports directly to the Audit Committee of Murphy USA. In selecting KPMG LLP as Murphy USA's independent registered accounting firm for 2019, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including: 
In addition, the Audit Committee periodically considers the appropriateness of a rotation of the independent registered accounting firm. At this time, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP as Murphy USA's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of Murphy USA and its stockholders. Under Murphy USA's policy for pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services by KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee has delegated the right to pre-approve services between meeting dates to the Chair of the Committee, subject to ratification of the full Committee at the next scheduled meeting. The Committee evaluates all services, including those engagements related to tax and internal control over financial reporting, considering the nature of such services in light of auditor independence, in accordance with the rules of the PCAOB.

Electronic Availability of Proxy Materials for 
2019 Annual Meeting 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to Be Held on May 1, 2019. This Proxy Statement and Murphy USA's Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 are available electronically at http://corporate.murphyusa.com/annual. 
In addition, the Company will provide without charge, upon the written request of any stockholder, a copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the financial statement schedules, required to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the fiscal year ended 
 December 31, 2018. Requests should be directed to Murphy USA Inc., Attn: Investor Relations Department, P.O. Box 7300, El Dorado, Arkansas 71731-7300 or to https://www.proxyvote.com. 
The Company will also deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company's Proxy Statement, to any stockholder who shares an address with other stockholders and where only one (1) set of materials were sent to that address to be shared by all stockholders at that address. 
Other Information 
The management of the Company knows of no business other than that described above that will be presented for consideration at the meeting. If any other business properly comes before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxies to vote such proxies thereon in accordance with their judgment. 
The expense of this solicitation, including cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, will be paid by the Company. Such expenses may also include the charges and expenses of banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries for forwarding proxies and proxy material to beneficial owners of shares. 
"Householding" occurs when a single copy of our annual report, proxy statement and Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Although we do not "household" for registered stockholders, a number of brokerage firms have instituted householding for shares held in street name. This procedure reduces our printing and mailing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards, and householding will not affect the mailing of account statements or special notices in any way. If you wish to receive a separate copy of our annual report, proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials than that sent to your household, either this year or in the future, you may contact the Company in the manner provided below and the Company will promptly send you a separate copy of our annual report, Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If members of your household receive multiple copies of our annual report, Proxy Statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, you may request householding by contacting the Company in the manner provided below. 
Requests in this regard should be addressed to:
