        This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy are to be first mailed on or about February 27, 2019, to all holders of record on January 30, 2019 (the "Record Date"), of the common stock, $.01 par value (the "Common Stock"), of Quanex Building Products Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). These materials are furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Company's principal executive offices, 1800 West Loop South, Suite 1500, Houston, Texas, 77027, at 8:00 a.m., C.D.T., on Friday, March 22, 2019, and at any adjournment or adjournments thereof. Shares of Common Stock represented by any un-revoked proxy in the enclosed form, if such proxy is properly executed and is received prior to the meeting, will be voted in accordance with the specifications made on such proxy. Proxies on which no specifications have been made will be voted FOR the election as director of all nominees listed herein, FOR ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent auditor for fiscal 2019, and FOR each other proposal included herein. Proxies are revocable by written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the address of the Company set forth below, or by delivery to the Company of a later dated proxy, at any time prior to their exercise. Proxies may also be revoked by a stockholder attending and voting in person at the meeting. 
        The Common Stock is the only class of securities of the Company that is entitled to vote at the meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, the date for determining stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the meeting, there were 33,299,617 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Each share is entitled to one vote. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of shares of Common Stock is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present in determining whether the quorum requirement is satisfied. 
        The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. Solicitation may be made personally or by mail, telephone or electronic data transfer by officers, directors and regular employees of the Company (who will not receive any additional compensation for any solicitation of proxies), or by the firm of Morrow Sodali, LLC, which has been retained by the Company to assist in the solicitation for a fee of approximately $7,500 plus expenses.

    MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING         
     PROPOSAL NO. 1   ELECTION OF DIRECTORS         
        Six directors are to be elected at the meeting. Prior to March 2016, the Board was divided into three classes, with the terms of office expiring at different times for each class. In March 2016, however, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to declassify the Board of Directors by providing that each director would be elected for a term of only one year. Class I and Class II directors were elected to one year terms at the Company's Annual Meeting in 2018, and the final three year term of the Class III directors will expire at the Company's Annual Meeting in 2019. As such, the declassification process is now complete, and all of the Company's current directors are up for election for one-year terms. 
        Because the Quanex Corporate Governance Guidelines mandate that no person may be nominated to serve on the Board after his or her 72nd birthday, Mr. Nosbaum is not standing for re-election as a director. Instead, the Board has nominated Mr. Donald R. Maier to stand for election as a director. Mr. Maier is currently the President and Chief Executive Officer of Armstrong Flooring, located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In selecting Mr. Maier to stand for election, the Board engaged in a thorough and diligent search process that involved consideration of a number of highly qualified candidates. The Board strongly believes that Mr. Maier's executive, industry, and operational experience, along with his strong understanding of corporate governance issues, will prove to be a huge asset for the Company's Board. More information about Mr. Maier's background and qualifications may be found on page 5 of this Proxy Statement. 
        Current directors Robert R. Buck, Susan F. Davis, William C. Griffiths, Joseph D. Rupp and Curtis M. Stevens are the directors currently standing for election. Mr. Griffiths was elected by the stockholders in 2016 to a term ending in 2019, and all other directors were elected in 2018 to a one-year term that ends in 2019. Each director nominee is standing for re-election for a term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
        In reviewing the information contained in this Proxy Statement that relates to our directors and officers, it is important to note that Quanex Building Products Corporation was initially created on December 12, 2007, in connection with the April 2008 spin-off of the building products business of Quanex Corporation, and the related merger of Quanex Corporation with Gerdau S.A. In connection with these transactions, the directors and officers of Quanex Corporation became the directors and officers of Quanex Building Products Corporation. As such, we have listed these "carryover" directors and officers as beginning with the Company in 2007 despite the fact that they may have served in similar positions with Quanex Corporation prior to that time. For information related to the transaction, the origins of Quanex Building Products Corporation, and any pre-transaction service as a director or officer of Quanex Corporation, please see (a) the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, (b) the Information Statement attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10, filed April 4, 2008 and effective April 9, 2008, and (c) Quanex Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A, for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007.

        The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Ms. Davis and each of Messrs. Buck, Maier, Nosbaum, Rupp, and Stevens have no material relationship with the Company and have satisfied the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. In assessing director and director nominee independence, the Board of Directors considered the relationships (as a customer or supplier or otherwise) of the Company with various companies with which such directors or director nominees may be affiliated and has determined that there are no such relationships that, in the opinion of the Board, might impact any director's independence. In making this assessment, the Board took into account the level of transactions with such companies in relationship to the Company's and the other parties' aggregate sales, the level of director or director nominee involvement in such transactions and the ability of such directors or director nominees to influence such transactions. Based on its review, the Board determined that no transactions occurred during the year that might affect any non-employee director or director nominee's independence. During the fiscal year, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee determined that there were no "related person" transactions, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, each director and director nominee has met the definitions of "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Table of Contents
        There are no arrangements or understandings between any person and any of the director nominees pursuant to which such director nominee was selected as a nominee for election at the Meeting, and there are no family relationships among any of the director nominees or executive officers of the Company. Ms. Davis and Messrs. Buck, Griffiths, Maier, Rupp and Stevens have each indicated a willingness to serve if elected. If a nominee should be unable to serve or will not serve for any reason, and if any other person is nominated, the persons designated on the accompanying form of proxy will have discretionary authority to vote or refrain from voting in accordance with their judgment on such other nominee unless authority to vote on such matter is withheld. 
   Vote Required  
        To be elected as a director, a director nominee must receive a majority of votes cast at the meeting with respect to such nominee (the number of shares voted "FOR" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that nominee). Cumulative voting is not permitted in the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be treated as a vote for or against any particular director nominee and will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. 
        Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, any current director that is nominated for election must tender his or her resignation as a director in the event that he or she receives more "AGAINST" votes than "FOR" votes. In such an event, the Governance Committee and subsequently the full Board would then review and determine whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. The Board is required to publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within ninety days from the date of the certification of the election results. 
      Recommendation         
        The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the elections of Ms. Davis and Messrs. Buck, Griffiths, Maier, Rupp and Stevens. Unless you give contrary instructions in your proxy, your proxy will be voted "FOR" the elections of Ms. Davis and Messrs. Buck, Griffiths, Maier, Rupp and Stevens. If any nominee should become unable or unwilling to accept nomination or election, the person acting under the proxy will vote for the election of such other person as the Board of Directors may recommend. The Board has no reason, however, to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected.  Table of Contents 
    PROPOSAL NO. 2   ADVISORY VOTE APPROVING NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION         
        At the meeting, the stockholders will vote on an advisory resolution approving the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as required pursuant to section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act. 
        We believe that our compensation practices and procedures are competitive, focused on pay-for-performance and strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. This advisory stockholder vote, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to express approval or withhold approval of the compensation we pay our named executive officers through voting for or against the following resolution: 
        "Resolved, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the Company's 2019 Proxy Statement, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other executive compensation tables and related discussion." 
        The Company and the Compensation & Management Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") remain committed to the compensation philosophy, practices, and objectives outlined under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" located on page 15 of this Proxy Statement. As always, the Compensation Committee will continue to review all elements of the executive compensation program and take any steps it deems necessary to continue to fulfill the objectives of the program. 
        Stockholders are encouraged to carefully review the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement for a detailed discussion of the Company's executive compensation program. 
        Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company or the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
        Unless the Board modifies its policy on the frequency on holding "Say-on-Pay" advisory votes, Say-on-Pay votes by our stockholders take place at each Annual Meeting, and the next such vote will occur at the annual meeting to which this Proxy Statement relates. 
      Vote Required         
        The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is necessary to approve the "Say-on-Pay" proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Say-on-Pay proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the Say-on-Pay proposal. 
      Board Recommendation         
        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the advisory resolution approving the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. Table of Contents
    PROPOSAL NO. 3   RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDIT FIRM         
        The Audit Committee has selected Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019. Grant Thornton LLP has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since April 2014, when it was retained by the Audit Committee after the completion of a competitive process to select an auditor for the Company's fiscal 2014 financial statements. We are asking the stockholders to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. Grant Thornton LLP was appointed by the Audit Committee in accordance with its charter. 
        In the event stockholders fail to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee may reconsider this appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the Company's and its stockholders' best interests. 
        The Audit Committee has approved all services provided by Grant Thornton LLP. A representative of Grant Thornton LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions you may ask. 
      Vote Required         
        This vote requires approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions with respect to the approval of this proposal will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes necessary for approval of this proposal. 
      Board Recommendation         
        The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. Table of Contents

    Compensation Discussion and Analysis         
      Introduction         
        This section of the proxy describes the compensation paid to the executive officers listed in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 39 of this Proxy Statement:
        The compensation programs described, however, apply more broadly to other officers and management personnel at the Company, with changes as appropriate to reflect different levels and types of responsibility. The Company believes that this approach helps to align Quanex employees into a unified team committed to the Company's corporate objectives. 
      Business and Compensation Context         
   Execution on Strategic Imperatives  
        Beginning early in fiscal 2018, we undertook a thorough assessment of the business and our position within the current economic cycle. As a result, we made a conscious decision to accelerate our de-leveraging plans, by focusing even greater attention to free cash flow generation. The Compensation Committee worked closely with management to develop a comprehensive and effective executive compensation program aligned with the Company's strategy. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee set modified free cash flow as the metric in the annual incentive plan, which is consistent with the 2018 strategic imperatives. 
        Through continuous improvement, tighter control over working capital, and a reduction in capital expenditures, our management team generated record free cash flow in fiscal 2018 of $78 million. The successful execution of our strategy resulted in returning cash to our shareholders and strengthening our balance sheet, which translated into the following significant accomplishments: Table of Contents
        The following graph illustrates critical financial metrics over the prior five-year period. Achievements during fiscal 2018 reflect our focus on free cash flow generation and our commitment to reducing our leverage while returning capital to our

   Realized Compensation and Shareholder Alignment  
        The effect of the strategic repositioning has meaningfully reduced realized pay for our executives during this time frame. The following chart illustrates the relationship between the CEO's aggregate  Table of Contents target and realized compensation from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2018 and the Company's total shareholder return between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2018. 
        Note: Target pay includes base salary; target bonus; and the grant date value of options, restricted stock, cash-based performance units, and performance shares for the applicable period. Realized compensation includes base salary, bonus payout, in-the-money value of stock options based on the October 31, 2018 stock price, the value of restricted stock and performance restricted stock units granted during the period based on the October 31, 2018 stock price, and the value of performance shares paid out during the period. 
        The following table shows the payouts (as a percentage of target) for the Company's annual incentive award program ("AIA") and performance awards under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan. Over the past five years, incentive plan payouts have been responsive to Company performance—on average, payouts under the AIA and long-term performance award have been approximately 85% of target and 42% of target, respectively.

[END TABLE]
        In fiscal 2018, we earned a payout of 170.7% of target under the AIA and 0% of target on the long-term performance award, consistent with our performance on goals during the year. 
   Responding to Shareholders: Changes for 2019  
        In line with our commitment to align pay and performance, we undertook careful analysis of the value drivers of our business in relation to our compensation arrangements. As a result, the Compensation Committee decided to change our compensation programs for fiscal 2019. The Compensation Committee believes the decisions made to our program going forward demonstrate our ongoing commitment to align executive compensation with stockholder interests and encourage value  Table of Contents creation at Quanex. Although these changes are discussed here, the full impact of these decisions will be reflected in 2019 pay and in next year's proxy statement. These recent changes include the following:
      Compensation Best Practices         
        We use traditional compensation elements of base salary, annual incentives, long-term incentives, and employee benefits to deliver attractive and competitive compensation. We benchmark both compensation and Company performance in evaluating the appropriateness of pay. All of our executive pay programs are administered by an independent compensation committee, with assistance from an independent consultant. Some highlights to our executive compensation program include the following actions:

 Motivate and reward executives for achieving specific financial goals• We offer a compensation  program that focuses on variable, performance-based compensation (through Annual and Long-Term Incentive Awards).• Specific financial performance measures used in the incentive programs include:• Fiscal 2018 Annual Incentive Awards (AIA) used a corporate scorecard  based on 100% Modified Free Cash Flow, provided the Company achieves the initial performance hurdle of positive operating income (excluding any amounts attributable to corporate). Fiscal 2019 AIA will be based on EBITDA growth and revenue growth,  with a modifier based on working capital as a percentage of sales.• In Fiscal 2018, stock  options were replaced with performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs"), which are based 100% on Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance. In addition, the fiscal 2018 performance share awards used compounded Earnings Per Share (EPS)  Growth to motivate long-term focus on bottom-line performance, Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to reward executives for performance compared to the market, and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to encourage effective capital deployment. In  fiscal 2019, the performance share awards will be based on corporate Return on Net Assets (RONA).

      Competitive Positioning         
   Fiscal 2018  
        The Compensation Committee annually examines the level of competitiveness and continued appropriateness of our executive compensation program. For fiscal 2018, Quanex used comparative compensation data from a group of seventeen direct industry companies, referred to in this CD&A as the "Peer Group," as a point of reference in designing and setting its compensation levels. The Peer Group consists of companies selected on criteria including size, complexity, revenue, market capitalization, risk profile, asset intensity, margins, and industrial application of the primary business. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the following companies to be included in the Company's fiscal 2018 peer group: 
        All the companies above, except for Insteel Industries, were included in the fiscal 2017 peer group. 
        Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), an independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee, used the Peer Group pay information, along with manufacturing and general industry survey data, to develop the appropriate range of compensation for each executive position. FW Cook also prepared an independent analysis of our key performance indicators such as profitability, growth, capital efficiency, balance sheet strength, and total return to stockholders compared to our sixteen industry peers. These results were then reported to the Compensation Committee in order to provide a thorough picture of the competitiveness of pay in the context of our performance as compared with that of our peers. While the Compensation Committee uses this analysis to help frame its decisions on compensation, it uses its collective judgment in determining executive pay. The Compensation Committee exercises discretion in making compensation decisions based on the following inputs: its understanding of market conditions, its understanding of competitive pay analysis, recommendations from the CEO regarding his direct reports, the Committee's overall evaluation of the executive's performance, and our overall compensation strategy.  Table of Contents
   Changes for Fiscal 2019  
        For fiscal 2019, the Company made the following changes to the peer group: added two companies (Armstrong Flooring and CSW Industrials) and removed four companies (LCI Industries, Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Ply Gem Holdings Inc., and Universal Forest Products Inc.). The fifteen companies below comprise the fiscal 2019 peer group: 
      Program Description         
        Our executive compensation program is a traditional design structure that has been customized to suit the business and organizational objectives of the Company. It includes base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, long-term incentives and executive benefits. Our fiscal 2018 long-term incentive program consisted of restricted stock grants, performance restricted stock units, and performance share awards. The amount of pay that is performance-based for an executive is directly related to the level of responsibility held by the position; accordingly, our highest ranked executive has the most performance-based pay as a percentage of total compensation. We set realistic but challenging goals in our annual incentive and long-term performance plans. In each case, if we fail to meet the pre-determined standards, no plan-based compensation is earned by executives. 
        We evaluate the various components of compensation annually relative to the competitive market for prevalence and value. By setting each of the elements against the competitive market within the parameters of our compensation strategy, the relative weighting of each element of our total pay mix varies by individual. We do not set fixed percentages for each element of compensation. The mix may also change over time as the competitive market moves or other market conditions which affect us change. We do not have and do not anticipate establishing any policies for allocating between long-term and currently paid compensation, or between cash and non-cash compensation. We have a process of assessing the appropriate allocation between these elements of compensation on a periodic basis and adjusting our position based on market conditions and our business strategy. 
   Base Salary  
         Purpose:    This pay element is intended to compensate executives for their qualifications and the value of their job in the competitive market. 
         Competitive Positioning:    The Company's goal is to target the market median as our strategic target for base salary. We review each executive's salary and performance every year to determine whether base salary should be adjusted. Along with individual performance, we also consider movement of salary in the market, as well as our financial results from the prior year to determine appropriate salary adjustments. 
        While the Compensation Committee applies general compensation concepts when determining the competitiveness of our executives' salaries, the Compensation Committee generally considers base salaries as being competitive when they are within a reasonable range of the stated market target (in this case, the market 50th percentile). In the most recent analysis using both our comparator group and general industry data, the salaries for our named executive officers were within 10% of the market 50th percentile.  Table of Contents
         Fiscal 2018 Review:    In December 2017, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain current base salaries for the executives based on the Company's relative position to the market and overall stockholder return. The table below provides base salaries for fiscals 2017 and 2018:

[END TABLE]
         Changes for Fiscal 2019:    In October 2018, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain current base salaries for the executives, except for Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson will receive a 10% increase, from $450,000 to $495,000, 
   Annual Incentive Awards (AIA)  
        Purpose:    This element of compensation is intended to reward executives for the achievement of annual goals related to key business drivers. It is also intended to emphasize to executives the key business goals of the Company from year to year. 
         Competitive Positioning:    The Company's strategy is to target the market median for annual incentives for performance that meets expected levels. We have established the range of possible payouts under the plan so that our competitive position could be above or below our stated strategy based on performance outcomes. Our most recent analysis showed our named executive officers to be in a range of 104% to 115% of the market median on target total cash compensation. 
         Plan Mechanics:    The Company's 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended in 2011 and 2014 (the "Omnibus Plan") serves as the governing plan document for our AIA. The AIA is a goal attainment incentive plan design that pays target award levels for expected performance results. 
        Fiscal 2018:    The AIA emphasizes earnings and informed decision making with regard to the Company's operational and strategic goals. To integrate the goals of the AIA throughout the Company, the annual incentive program participation includes the top leaders of all of our domestic business divisions. We believe this is necessary in order to align managers throughout the organization with this incentive structure. The plan design requires the Company (excluding any amounts attributable to corporate) to have positive operating income in order for any Annual Incentive Awards to be paid out. If the performance hurdle is met, then the bonus pool for all Annual Incentive Awards is funded at the maximum bonus opportunity level. 
        Rigorous Goals:    If funded, the Compensation Committee will assess performance against the fiscal 2018 corporate scorecard weighted 100% on Modified Free Cash Flow. Modified Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus changes in accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable,  Table of Contents minus capital expenditures. The Company set rigorous performance expectations based on the forecasted results of the operating divisions and the projected markets for building products. The Committee established performance goals for fiscal 2018 that require the Company to at least perform at last year's levels to earn a payout. 
         Target Award Levels:    Based on competitive market practices for annual incentives, and our compensation strategy, we set a target award opportunity for each of our executives. This is the amount of incentive compensation the executive can earn when performance meets expected results, or "target." The table below reflects the payout percentage of a named executive's base salary at the threshold, target and maximum levels of performance for fiscal 2018. 
    Potential AIA Payout   Expressed as a% of Salary

         VP—IR & Treasurer     25%   50%   100% 
[END TABLE]
         Fiscal 2018 Results:    For fiscal 2018, the performance hurdle of positive operating income (excluding corporate) was met, with the Company having earned operating income of $47 million. Once the hurdle was met and the plan was funded, the Compensation Committee determined the incentive payouts. The primary metric for the AIA scorecard considered by the Compensation Committee was the Modified Free Cash Flow target of $69.9 million. In calculating Modified Free Cash Flow, the Committee adjusted the EBITDA component by factoring in the effect of foreign exchange rates, LIFO, stock-based compensation, restructuring related costs, loss on sale, and transaction related costs. The Company achieved Modified Free Cash Flow of $76.6 million, which resulted in an AIA achievement of 171% of target payment for the officers. The AIA achievement resulted in payments to participants as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO     100%   170.7% 
 COO     60%   128.0% 
 CFO     65%   111.0% 
 GC     60%   102.4% 
 VP—IR & Treasurer     50%   85.4% 
[END TABLE]
         Fiscal 2019 Changes:    For fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee took careful consideration of the Company's performance throughout the year. Despite our record performance on free cash flow generation, the Company fell short on our EBITDA growth targets for the year. In line the Company's commitment to be responsive to our shareholders, for fiscal 2019, modified free cash flow will be replaced with a scorecard based on 50% EBITDA growth and 50% revenue growth, with a modifier based on working capital as a percentage of sales. The Compensation Committee believes the combination of EBITDA and revenue growth metrics with a modifier based on working capital% of sales will balance the management team's focus and position the Company strategically for healthy growth and profitability for fiscal 2019. The plan will no longer use positive operating income (excluding any amounts attributable to corporate) as the initial performance hurdle. 
        AIA participant target payout percentages will remain the same for fiscal 2019.  Table of Contents 
   Long-Term Incentive Compensation  
         Purpose:    We have a long-term incentive program designed to help align the interests of executive management with shareholders and reward executives for the achievement of long-term goals. Long-term incentives are also critical to the retention of key employees and provide executives an opportunity for personal capital accumulation. For these reasons we have placed more value on the long-term incentive element of compensation than on other elements. The result is that this element of compensation represents at least half of the named executive officers' total direct compensation. 
         Competitive Positioning:    Our long-term incentive philosophy targets the 50th percentile of the market. In our most recent analysis versus the market, we found that the named executive officers' competitive positioning is within approximately 15% of the market 50th percentile. The individual performance of each named executive officer is not considered in the value of the long-term incentive awards granted. Since the goals are set prospectively, the Company's financial performance determines the ultimate value of the award. 
         Participation:    Participation in the program includes the named executive officers and certain key contributors to the business and is determined based on competitive practices as well as our assessment of which positions contribute to long-term value creation. 
         Target Award Levels:    In order to align with our market strategy of targeting the 50th percentile, we have maintained the dollar value of target awards for our executives. This has been the practice for the CEO, CFO, and GC since fiscal 2016 and is new for the VPs in fiscal 2018. The following LTI targets were established for the executives for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO      $ 2,145,000   
 COO      $ 900,000   
 CFO      $ 700,000   
 GC      $ 594,000   
 VP—IR & Treasurer      $ 175,000

      Fiscal Year 2018 Long Term Incentive Program Design         
   Vehicles and Goals  
        At the Compensation Committee's December 2017 meeting, the Compensation Committee elected to change the Company's long-term incentive plan design to consist of a combination of restricted stock, performance restricted stock units (PRSUs), and performance shares. Beginning in fiscal 2018, the PRSUs replaced stock options, resulting in a long-term incentive mix that is 75% performance-based. The allocation between the long-term incentive vehicles is determined by the Compensation Committee based on market information provided by its compensation consultant, as well as input from senior management regarding the key business drivers that allow for the continuation of a results-oriented culture. The Omnibus Plan does not provide for any specific subjective individual performance component in determining the ultimate value of the award. The following chart illustrates the fiscal 2018 allocation of long-term incentives by vehicle type. 
    Fiscal 2018 LTI Mix         
   Restricted Stock  
        Restricted stock represents 25% of the participant's long-term incentive value. We chose 25% of the total value because it provides meaningful retentive value to our key executives, helps smooth out market volatility, and is cost efficient. The restricted stock awards vest three years after the award is granted, so long as the participant remains employed by us. We believe restricted stock awards are an effective long-term compensation vehicle through which key employees can be retained, especially through volatile periods in the market. 
   Performance Restricted Stock Units  
        Performance restricted stock units represent 25% of the participant's long-term incentive value. The PRSUs can be earned based on absolute total shareholder return over the three-year performance period. In order for executives to receive a target payout, the Company must have absolute TSR improvement of 20%. The table below illustrates the number of shares that will vest based on the  Table of Contents
Company's absolute TSR under the PRSU awards. Performance will be interpolated for any results in between threshold and target or target and maximum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Maximum     ³ 50%   150% 
 Target     20%   100% 
 Threshold     –20%   50% 
[END TABLE]
   Performance Shares  
        Performance shares represent 50% of each participant's long-term incentive value. Performance shares are payable 50% in cash and 50% in stock and are intended to motivate executives to achieve preset goals that are in line with critical business drivers. These awards also provide an incentive for executives to outperform peer companies as measured by relative total shareholder return. 
        We set target award values for each year. These target award values are used to calculate the number of performance shares granted to each executive. The final number of shares to vest is not determined until the end of a three-year performance cycle and is based on Earnings Per Share Growth (or "EPS Growth") and Relative Total Shareholder Return (or "Relative TSR"). Each goal is weighted 50% of the total performance share award. As part of our emphasis on performance-based long-term incentives the payouts under these metrics are subject to a modifier based on Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") improvement. 
        EPS Growth is measured as the cumulative value of EPS over the three-year performance period, Relative TSR is expressed as the stock price appreciation plus dividends reinvested relative to appreciation of our peer group, and ROIC performance is measured as the Company's absolute improvement over the three-year performance period. ROIC is defined as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders' equity for the year. ROIC excludes other comprehensive loss, goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes, as they are not reflective of our operating performance. Modifier payouts can range from 0% to 50% of target, but no modifier will be applied if the Company does not reach at least threshold performance on the EPS Growth and Relative TSR metrics. Performance shares will continue to be capped at 200% of target. The goals for EPS Growth and Relative TSR are listed below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Maximum     75%   12%   100%   100%   200% 
 Target     60%   9%   50%   50%   100% 
 Threshold     30%   6%   37.5%   37.5%   75% 
[END TABLE]
        To measure performance for the fiscal 2018 grant, the three-year cumulative compounded EPS growth will be applied to the starting value of $0.79 per share, which was derived from historical EPS, adjusted for the pro forma results of businesses acquired, restructuring and goodwill impairment charges, less certain transaction costs. 
   Fiscal 2018 Long-Term Incentive Grants  
        The number of long-term incentive awards granted during fiscal 2018 was determined by: (1) taking 25% of the participant's target award value and dividing it by the 10-day average closing  Table of Contents stock price between October 18, 2017 and October 31, 2017 to determine the number of restricted stock awards, (2) taking 25% of the participant's target value and dividing it by the calculated Monte Carlo value of the PRSUs based on the 10-day average closing stock price between October 18, 2017 and October 31, 2017 to determine the number of performance restricted stock units, and (3) taking 50% of the participant's target award value and dividing it by the 10-day average closing stock price between October 18, 2017 and October 31, 2017 to determine the number of performance shares. The equity grant calculations apply an average stock price based on the last 10 trading days in October 2017. For more information related to long-term incentive awards granted during fiscal 2017, please see the table entitled "Grants of Plan Based Awards" located on page 41 of this Proxy Statement. 
   Previously Awarded Performance Shares  
   Fiscal 2016 Performance Shares  
        The performance shares awarded to our executives in December 2015 (the "Fiscal 2016 Performance Shares") became payable to executives in December 2018, with a final value determined by the Company's performance period for fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018. Performance measures and goals for the Fiscal 2016 Performance Shares included EPS Growth and Relative TSR, each weighted 50% of the total performance share award. EPS Growth is measured as the cumulative value of EPS over the three-year performance period, and Relative TSR is expressed as the stock price appreciation plus dividends reinvested relative to appreciation of our peer group. Relative TSR is determined by calculating the change in the value of our stock plus the value of dividends and comparing that value with that of our peer group. Our performance against these pre-established goals determined the payout to executives within a range from threshold to maximum. The pre-established goals and the actual performance to these goals are set forth below.

   Fiscal 2019 Performance Shares  
        In December 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to change the design of the performance shares to be based on 100% return on net assets (RONA). RONA is defined as operating income over total assets minus cash minus current liabilities plus current long-term debt. This decision  Table of Contents to move to one performance metric was made to help focus the executives on exceptional performance on returns. The performance shares will continue to be capped at 200% of target.

   LTI Targets  
        For fiscal 2019, we will continue to target the market median for long-term incentives. Our review of market conditions for fiscal 2019 indicated no change to target LTI values for all the executives. The following table shows the LTI targets for the executives.

      Processes and Procedures for Determining Executive Compensation         
        Guided by the principal objectives described above, the Compensation Committee approves the structure of the executive compensation program and administers the programs for our executive officers, including matters where approval by our independent Compensation Committee members is appropriate for tax or regulatory reasons. The following describes the roles of key participants in the process. 
   The Role of Executives  
        Our Chief Executive Officer is the only executive who works with the Compensation Committee and compensation consultant in establishing compensation levels and performance targets. Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for reviewing the compensation and performance of the other executive officers and, as such, makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding adjustments in compensation to such executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations along with the Compensation Committee's own evaluation of individual and business performance and the market data provided by its compensation consultant. In making recommendations, the Chief Executive Officer relies upon his evaluation of his direct reports' performance and competitive compensation information. The Chief Executive Officer does not recommend his own compensation. The Chief Executive Officer recommends AIA performance goals to the Compensation Committee. The Chief Executive Officer, with input from the compensation consultant, recommends performance goals for long-term incentive awards that are properly aligned with the business goals and compensation strategy. 
        Our Senior Vice President—General Counsel and Secretary serves as the liaison between the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance Committee. In this role,  Table of Contents he interfaces with the compensation consultant to carry out the duties of the Compensation Committee and Governance Committee. 
   The Role of Independent External Advisors  
        To facilitate the formulation and administration of our compensation program, the Compensation Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") since July 2012 as its independent consultant on executive compensation matters. FW Cook helps the Compensation Committee assess the competitiveness and appropriateness of compensation programs throughout the market, including our peers, and develop a compensation program that is consistent with our objectives and market conditions. FW Cook meets with our Compensation Committee in executive sessions and advises the Compensation Committee with respect to a wide range of issues related to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee authorizes the scope of services that it desires FW Cook to provide for the Company, including reviewing and analyzing market data, evaluating our comparator group composition, making recommendations for incentive system designs, providing market and regulatory updates, assisting with deliberations related to CEO compensation, reviewing any relevant information and reporting to the Compensation Committee on all aspects of our compensation programs. FW Cook reports directly to, and takes its charge from, the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee does not specifically direct the manner in which FW Cook performs the scope of services it provides to the Company. Additionally, the Compensation Committee makes all final decisions regarding compensation. 
   Independence of Advisors  
        The Compensation Committee reviewed the independence of FW Cook based on the NYSE rules for independence which include the following factors: (i) the provision of other services to the Company by FW Cook; (ii) the amount of fees from the Company paid to FW Cook as a percentage of FW Cook's total revenue; (iii) the policies and procedures of FW Cook that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of the individual compensation advisors who serve the Committee with any member of the Committee; (v) any stock of the Company owned by such individual compensation advisors, and (vi) any business or personal relationship of FW Cook or the individual compensation advisors who serve the Committee with an executive officer of the Company. The Compensation Committee also reviewed FW Cook's policies for avoiding conflicts of interest. The Compensation Committee has determined, based on its analysis of the factors listed above, that the work of FW Cook and the individual compensation consultants employed by FW Cook does not create any conflicts of interest and that FW Cook meets the NYSE standards for independence. 
   The Role of the Compensation & Management Development Committee  
        The Compensation Committee currently comprises three non-employee independent directors. The Compensation Committee's duties in administering executive compensation programs include the following: Table of Contents
        The Compensation Committee determines the Chief Executive Officer's salary and incentive awards based upon an assessment of individual and Company performance, as well as market data provided by the compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee may form and delegate duties to subcommittees when appropriate. A more expansive list of the Compensation Committee's responsibilities can be found in its charter, which can be viewed on our website at www.quanex.com. 
   Post-Employment Compensation  
        Severance and change in control benefits are provided under the employment agreements of our executives, as well as under our incentive plans. These benefits are discussed at greater length in the section entitled "Employment Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 34 of this Proxy Statement. 
        Since 2013, the Company has maintained a policy to no longer provide excise tax gross up benefits to any new executives in the event of a change in control termination. 
   Deferred Compensation Plan  
        The Company has a nonqualified deferred compensation program that gives executives the opportunity to defer income. As with our various other plans and programs, this deferral opportunity is designed to attract and retain key executives. 
        The deferred compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee. Before eligible employees can participate, they must first receive a recommendation from our senior managers and then final approval by the Compensation Committee. Participants in the program may choose to defer up to 100% of their annual and long-term incentive bonuses. Participants may choose from a variety of investment choices in which the Company will invest their deferrals over the defined deferral period. 
   Executive Benefits  
         Purpose:    The role of executive benefits is to provide financial security, enhanced employee welfare, and competitive packages that are meaningful in the markets for which we compete for executive talent. These programs provide post retirement income, and in some cases, additional benefits in place of those that would otherwise be lost due to plan limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. 
        Competitive Positioning:    Our executive benefits strategy is to provide meaningful yet cost-efficient benefits to executives at a level that aligns with our desired competitive positioning of the market median. We provide executives with health and welfare benefits that are consistent with our program for exempt personnel generally. Supplemental retirement and supplemental life benefits are also provided to our officers. 
   Program Elements:  Table of Contents
      Other Compensation Items         
   Clawback Provision (Recovery of Incentive Payments)  
        We have a policy to enable the Board, in its judgment and to the extent permitted by governing law, to require reimbursement of any cash bonus or performance shares paid to an executive where (a) the value of the award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material restatement, and (b) a lower payment would have been made to the executive based on the restated financial results. In each instance, the Company may seek to recover that portion of the affected executive's annual and/or long-term incentive payments that is higher than the payment that would have originally been paid. No reimbursement will be required if such material restatement was caused by or resulted from any change in accounting policy or rules. In addition, we have amended our performance based award agreements to facilitate a transition to new SEC and stock exchange requirements when they are finalized. 
   Risk Assessment  
        In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee discussed and analyzed risks associated with the Company's compensation policies and practices for executive officers and all employees generally. This discussion included, but was not limited to, topics such as eligibility, affordability, retention impact, corporate objectives, alignment with shareholder interests, governance, and possible unintended consequences. The Compensation Committee did not identify any risks arising from the Company's compensation programs or practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
   Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines  
        We encourage our executives to own our Common Stock because we believe such ownership provides strong alignment of interests between executives and shareholders. Our executive stock ownership guidelines provide that different levels of executives are expected to own a specific value of our Common Stock, expressed as a percentage of salary. The stock ownership requirement for the current CEO is effective five years after assuming his role. For other executives, the stock ownership requirement is effective three years after assuming their respective roles. The chart below shows the guidelines by executive level.

[END TABLE]
        All of our named executives currently are in compliance with the executive stock ownership guidelines.  Table of Contents 
   Prohibition on Certain Transactions Involving Company Stock  
        The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines specifically prohibit the Company's directors, officers and employees from hedging or pledging Company stock; maintaining margin accounts holding Company Stock, and buying or selling any puts, calls or other derivatives of Company stock. Please see page 63 of this Proxy Statement for the Company's policy with regard to these activities.

   Accounting Considerations and Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation  
        In designing compensation programs, we consider the effects that accounting and taxation may have on us, the named executive officers or other employees as a group. We account for compensation arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. All share based payments to employees are measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized in the statement of operations as compensation expense over their requisite service periods. 
        Historically, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code provided that we may not deduct for federal income tax purposes compensation of more than $1,000,000 paid in any year to the Chief Executive Officer or any of the three other most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the Chief Financial Officer, unless the compensation is paid solely on the attainment of one or more pre-established objective performance goals and certain other considerations are met. 
        The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to any "covered employee" in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible, unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. A "covered employee" under Section162(m) is any employee who has served as our CEO, CFO or other named executive officers for tax years after December 31, 2016. The rules and regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) are complicated, and may change from time to time, and the scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s performance-based exemption from the  Table of Contents deduction limit is uncertain. As such, there can be no guarantee that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for tax deductibility in fact will. 
   Influence of Say on Pay Results on Executive Compensation Decisions  
        Management and the Compensation Committee are attentive to the outcome of the shareholder "Say on Pay" vote. At the Company's 2018 annual shareholder meeting, the Company received significant support for its executive compensation program, with 98.9% of the votes in favor of the "Say on Pay" resolution. The Compensation Committee remains responsive to shareholder feedback and believes that the strong support from shareholders indicates satisfaction with the executive compensation program. 
      Employment Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control         
        The Company has entered into change in control agreements with its named executive officers. We believe that the change in control agreements help us attract and retain our named executive officers by reducing the personal uncertainty and anxiety that arises from the possibility of a future business combination. During a potential change in control, we do not want executives leaving to pursue other employment out of concern for the security of their jobs or being unable to concentrate on their work. To enable executives to focus on the best interest of our stockholders, we offer change in control agreements that generally provide benefits to executives whose employment terminates in connection with a change in control. 
        In addition, to attract certain of our named executive officers to accept employment with us, we agreed to provide those officers who previously were employed by Quanex Corporation with severance agreements that will provide them certain of the protections they would have been entitled to if they had remained with Quanex Corporation following the spin-off of Quanex Building Products Corporation from Quanex Corporation in April 2008. The Company also entered into a letter agreement with its President and CEO, effective July 9, 2013, which contains certain executive severance provisions. The Company entered into these arrangements because executives at this level generally require a longer timeframe to find comparable jobs as fewer jobs at this level exist in the market. In addition, executives often have a large percentage of their personal wealth dependent on the status of their employer, given the requirement to hold a multiple of their salary in stock and the fact that a large part of their compensation is stock-based. The amount and type of benefits were based on competitive market practices for executives at this level. 
        Provisions of the severance agreements and severance letter arrangement require a termination of employment before any benefits are paid. The change in control agreements require both a change in control and a termination of employment before any benefits are paid (a "double trigger"). If an executive officer who is covered by both a change in control agreement and a severance agreement or letter arrangement experiences both a change in control of the Company and a termination of employment, benefits are payable under only the change in control agreement; in no event will the executive be able to receive payment under both the severance agreement or letter arrangement and the change in control agreement. 
   Severance Agreements of Certain Executives  
        This section describes the severance agreements entered into by Quanex with the SVP—Finance and CFO and the SVP—General Counsel and Secretary. As described above, benefits are payable under the severance agreements following a termination of employment that meets certain requirements. A termination of employment that triggers benefits under the severance agreements includes involuntary termination by the Company without Cause. "Cause" exists if the executive commits gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with his employment; an act of fraud,  Table of Contents embezzlement or theft in connection with his employment; intentional wrongful damage to Company property; intentional wrongful disclosure of our secret processes or confidential information; or an act leading to a conviction of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude. 
        If the executive is entitled to benefits under the severance agreement, the executive will receive the following:
   President and CEO Severance Letter Agreement  
        This section describes the severance provisions contained in the letter agreement entered into by the Company and Mr. Griffiths upon his assumption of duties as the Company's Chairman, President and CEO. In the event that Mr. Griffiths' employment is terminated by the Board of Directors for any reason other than "Cause," as defined in the change in control agreement, or a material violation of the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the following benefits would be payable:
        The letter agreement requires Mr. Griffiths to execute a mutually satisfactory release of all claims before the expiration of the 90th day following his termination, or he shall forfeit any and all payment, reimbursements, and benefits due under the letter agreement. 
   Change in Control Agreements  
        As described above, benefits are payable under the change in control agreements following the occurrence of both (i) a change in control of the Company and (ii) termination of the named executive officer's employment with the Company. Each of the following events generally constitutes a change in control of the Company for purposes of the change in control agreements: Table of Contents
        Terminations of employment that meet the termination requirement under the change in control agreements will be similar to but broader than those required under the severance agreements. For these purposes, a termination of employment would include a termination by the Company without Cause as well as the executive's resignation for "Good Reason." "Good Reason" under the change in control agreements will include (but will not be limited to):
        If the executive officer is entitled to benefits under a change in control agreement, the executive officer would receive the following: Table of Contents termination of employment and (y) performance bonus for the year immediately preceding the year of termination of employment; 
        If an executive officer is entitled to benefits under a change in control agreement, the following would occur immediately upon the occurrence of a change in control (regardless of whether the named executive officer's employment is terminated as a result of the change in control):
        As set forth above, a named executive officer is entitled to benefits under either the severance agreement or the change in control agreement; under no circumstances can a named executive officer receive payment under both agreements.  Table of Contents
      Post-Employment Compensation Table         
        The following table describes the potential payments or benefits upon termination, other post-employment scenarios or change in control for each of the Company's named executive officers. The amounts in the table below show only the value of amounts payable or benefits due to enhancements in connection with each scenario, and do not reflect amounts otherwise payable or benefits otherwise due as a result of employment. In each case, the termination is assumed to take place on October 31, 2018.

      CEO Pay Ratio         
        We have calculated a ratio of our CEO's pay as compared to our median employee, in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. To identify our median employee, we relied on our payroll records to examine the fiscal 2018 total taxable wages for all full-time, part-time and seasonal employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as of October 31, 2018, other than those workers employed at our facility in Germany. On the determination date, our 83 German employees comprised less than five percent of our total workforce of 3,818, and those German employees were thus excluded from the median employee calculation. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to the calculation of total employee compensation, and did not annualize base salary pay for any employees that were employed for only a portion of the year. For employees located in the United Kingdom, we converted compensation amounts to United States Dollars using an average foreign exchange rate measured over the entirety of fiscal 2018. 
        Once we determined the identity of our median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee using the same methodology that we used in calculating the total annual compensation of our Named Executive Officers as set forth in our Summary Compensation Table. Based on that calculation, our median employee's 2018 total compensation was $36,602 and our CEO's 2018 total compensation was $3,952,016, which resulted in a pay ratio of approximately 108 to 1.

 Table of Contents values may be found in Note 15, "Stock-Based Compensation" included in the audited financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018. Performance share awards and performance restricted stock units are expected to settle at target (100%), however, performance shares and performance restricted stock units could potentially settle at maximum (200% and 150%, respectively). If these performance share awards and performance restricted stock units were to vest at maximum, the fair value for the equity portion of these awards and restricted stock granted during fiscal 2018 for Messrs. Griffiths, Wilson, Korb, Delaney and Zuehlke would be $2,303,910; $644,805; $500,940; $424,350; and $125,235, respectively. These values reflect the Company's assumptions to determine the accounting expense for these awards and do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers. For information regarding the restricted stock, performance shares, and option awards granted in fiscal 2018, please see the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table located on page 41 of this Proxy Statement.  
The AIA and performance share payouts would include the dollar value of such amounts deferred under the Quanex Building Products Corporation or Quanex Corporation Deferred Compensation ("DC") Plan, as applicable. Under the terms of each DC Plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their incentive bonus to a mix of cash, or notional common stock units or investment accounts. None of the named executive officers deferred amounts pursuant to these awards for the periods presented.  
The amounts paid for the AIA, performance units and performance shares, along with any respective deferred amounts, are as follows:

        We have established the Salaried and Nonunion Employee Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan intended to be a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the benefit of substantially all of our salaried and nonunion hourly employees with the exception of those employed by the Company's cabinet components division. With some exceptions, an employee hired prior to January 1, 2018, is eligible to participate in the Pension Plan once that employee has completed one hour of service. Employees hired after January 1, 2018, are eligible to participate after reaching age 21 and completing one year of service. 
        Under the Pension Plan, two main types of benefits are available to participants, depending upon when they began participating in the Pension Plan or the Quanex Corporation Salaried Employees'  Table of Contents
Pension Plan (the "Quanex Corporation Pension Plan"). The employees who participated in the Quanex Corporation Pension Plan on or before December 31, 2006, are generally referred to as "Traditional Participants," while employees who began participating in the Quanex Corporation Pension Plan or the Pension Plan after such date are generally referred to as "Cash Balance Participants". 
        Under the Pension Plan, a Traditional Participant is entitled to receive a monthly single life annuity, payable following termination of employment at or after age 65, equal to the sum of (i) and (ii), less (iii), where: 
          (i)  is the greater of (x) 1.5% of the Traditional Participant's average monthly compensation for the five consecutive calendar years that lead to the highest monthly average multiplied by his whole and fractional years of benefit service earned with Quanex Corporation prior to November 1, 1985, or (y) the product of $9.00 and his years of benefit service earned with Quanex Corporation prior to November 1, 1985; 
         (ii)  is the greater of (x) the sum of 1% of the Traditional Participant's average monthly compensation for the five consecutive calendar years that lead to the highest monthly average up to but not in excess of 1/12 of the average of the Social Security taxable wage bases in effect for each calendar year during the 35-year period ending with the last day of the calendar year in which the Traditional Participant attains Social Security retirement age (referred to as Social Security covered compensation) and 1.5% of the Traditional Member's average monthly compensation for the five consecutive calendar years that lead to the highest monthly average in excess of 1/12 of the Traditional Member's Social Security covered compensation, the total of which is then multiplied by his whole and fractional years of benefit service earned with Quanex Corporation and the Company from and after November 1, 1985 or (y) the product of $9.00 and the Traditional Member's whole and fractional years of benefit service earned with Quanex Corporation and the Company from and after November 1, 1985; and 
        (iii)  is the Traditional Participant's monthly accrued benefit under any qualified defined benefit plan that was maintained at any time by Quanex Corporation or the Company to the extent that the Traditional Participant's service taken into account for benefit accrual purposes under such other plan is taken into account as benefit service under the Pension Plan. 
        Traditional Participants are eligible for early retirement benefits when they attain age 55 with five years of service. The early retirement benefit is calculated as (x) minus (y), where (x) is the sum of items (i) and (ii) immediately above, reduced by 5/9 of 1% for each of the first 60 months that the early retirement benefit payment commencement date precedes the Traditional Participant's normal retirement date and further reduced by 5/18 of 1% for each of the months in excess of 60 that the payment commencement date precedes the Traditional Participant's normal retirement date, and (y) is item (iii) immediately above, but determined as if the Traditional Participant's benefit under such Quanex Corporation or Company qualified defined benefit plan commences to be paid at the same time as the Pension Plan benefit, using the reduction factors used in connection with such other qualified defined benefit plan. 
        Under the Pension Plan, upon termination of employment with the Company, a Cash Balance Participant receives the following after at least three years of vesting: 
        The sum of the notional company contributions accrued under the Pension Plan through the date on which the Cash Balance Participant terminates employment, where such contribution generally equals 4% of the Cash Balance Participant's compensation for the applicable year; plus 
        The sum of the interest credits on those notional company contributions accrued under the Pension Plan through the date on which the Cash Balance Participant terminates employment with us, where such contribution generally equals the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury security for the fifth month prior to the first day of the applicable year.  Table of Contents 
        For purposes of both Traditional Participants' benefits and Cash Balance Participants' benefits, the compensation taken into account under the Pension Plan generally comprises salary and bonus compensation for the applicable year. 
        Pension Plan benefits for unmarried participants are generally payable as a single life annuity and for married participants as a 50% joint and survivor annuity, unless the participant and his spouse, if applicable, elect to receive the benefit under another optional form of payment available under the Pension Plan. If the participant receives a benefit other than a single life annuity, the benefit will be adjusted to provide the actuarial equivalence of the participant's benefit under the Pension Plan. This adjustment is designed so Pension Plan benefits will be equivalent as if the option had not been chosen. 
        Mr. Delaney is presently eligible to receive early retirement benefits under the Pension Plan as a Traditional Participant, and Mr. Griffiths is presently eligible to receive retirement benefits under the Pension Plan as a Cash Balance Participant. 
   Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan  
        We provide additional retirement benefits to certain of our named executive officers under the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). Eligibility to participate in the SERP is determined by the Board of Directors. Currently the SVP—Finance and CFO, and the SVP—General Counsel and Secretary are the only participants in the SERP. 
        Under the SERP, an eligible participant receives a monthly single life annuity (or actuarially equivalent optional form of payment) payable at age 65 equal to:
        The eligible executive is required to remain employed until he or she has accumulated five years of service in order to receive a benefit under the SERP. SERP participants are eligible for early retirement benefits when they attain age 55 with five years of service. The early retirement benefit is calculated based on average compensation and service at early retirement, and reduced by 5% for each year benefit commencement precedes age 65. Mr. Delaney is presently eligible to receive early retirement benefits under the SERP. 
        Upon an eligible executive's termination of employment after a change in control, he or she will be eligible to receive a lump sum payment in lieu of any other benefit payable from the SERP. The lump sum is equal to the present value of the SERP life annuity, which is payable immediately without reduction for early payment, based on the executive's years of service and compensation at date of termination. The SERP is administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   Restoration Plan  
        We provide additional retirement benefits to our executive officers who do not participate in the SERP under the Restoration Plan (the "Restoration Plan"). Eligibility to participate in the Restoration Plan is determined by a committee appointed by the Company's Board of Directors. Currently, the CEO, the COO, the VP-Investor Relations & Treasurer, the Company's divisional leaders, certain key employees, and certain former officers and divisional leaders are the only participants in the Restoration Plan.  Table of Contents
        Under the Restoration Plan, an eligible participant will receive a lump sum actuarial equivalent of a monthly benefit for life payable at age 65 equal to:
        The specific elements of an executive's compensation taken into account for purposes of the Restoration Plan are the same as those items of compensation taken into account for purposes of the Pension Plan, described above. 
        The eligible executive must remain employed until he or she has accumulated five years of service in order to receive a benefit under the Restoration Plan. Restoration Plan participants are eligible for early retirement benefits when they attain age 55 with five years of service. The early retirement benefit is the actuarial equivalent of the participant's lump sum benefit under the Restoration Plan, determined as of his or her early retirement date. Mr. Griffiths is currently eligible to receive retirement benefits under the Restoration Plan. The Restoration Plan is administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   Pension Benefits Table  
        The following table discloses the years of credited service of, present single-sum value of the accrued benefits as of October 31, 2018 for, and payments during fiscal year 2018 for, the named executive officers under the SERP, the Pension Plan, and the Restoration Plan.

 Table of Contents requires a participant to have attained age 55 with 5 Years of Service. Mr. Griffiths is currently eligible to receive a retirement benefit under the Restoration Plan. None of the named executive officers is currently eligible to receive an early retirement benefit under the Restoration Plan. The Restoration Plan requires five years of service for vesting purposes for Traditional Participants, and three years of service for Cash Balance Participants. In addition, the Restoration Plan pays a death benefit to the designated beneficiary of a participant if the participant has retired or terminated employment, but has not commenced payment. The Restoration Plan does not provide a disability benefit. The Company has no policy for granting additional service under the Restoration Plan.   Table of Contents
Vesting in the SERP is based on five years of service. Early retirement under the SERP requires a participant to attain age 55 with five years of service. Mr. Delaney is currently eligible to receive an early retirement benefit under the SERP. If a participant retires prior to age 65, the accrued benefit is reduced 5% for each year (and fractional year) that the participant's benefit commencement precedes age 65. 
Benefits under the SERP are paid under the following options:
The SERP also pays a death benefit to the designated beneficiary if the participant has retired or terminated employment, but has not commenced payment. In addition, the SERP pays a disability benefit. Should a participant with six months of service terminate due to disability prior to early retirement, the SERP will pay a disability benefit until age 65 equal to 50% of the sum of his monthly earnings in effect at the date of his disability and the monthly equivalent of the average of his incentive awards for the prior three plan years, less the sum of (1) the participant's Pension Plan benefit; (2) the participant's Social Security benefit; (3) the participant's benefit under the Company's group long-term disability insurance plan; (4) the participant's benefit under an individual disability policy provided by the Company; and (5) the participant's benefit under the Company's wage continuation policy plan. Benefits payable from the SERP are equal to the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit at date of distribution employing the actuarial equivalent definition from the Pension Plan. The Company has no policy for granting additional service under the SERP. Mr. Griffiths is not participating in the SERP, and therefore participates in the Restoration Plan.  
      Qualified Defined Contribution Plans         
   Salaried and Nonunion Employee 401(k) Plan  
        We have established the Salaried and Nonunion Employee 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), a defined contribution plan intended to be a tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the benefit of substantially all of our salaried and nonunion hourly employees. An employee is eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan on the later of (i) the date the Company or an affiliate which employs the employee adopts the 401(k) Plan or (ii) the date the employee completes one hour of service for the Company. Effective January 1, 2017, employees of the Company's cabinet components division became eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. 
        Participants in the 401(k) Plan may contribute from 1% of compensation per payroll period up to a maximum percentage per payroll period to be determined by the administrative committee of the Company's plans appointed by the Board of Directors (the "Benefits Committee"). Certain highly compensated employees are subject to a maximum payroll contribution of 7% per payroll period. In addition, any new participants who do not affirmatively elect otherwise have 3% of their compensation per payroll period automatically contributed to the 401(k) Plan. To the extent permitted by the Benefits Committee, participants may also make after-tax contributions to the 401(k) Plan. Participants are also allowed to make Roth contributions to the 401(k) Plan. 
        Effective January 1, 2018, the Company makes matching contributions to each participant's account equal to 50% of the pre-tax contributions the participant makes to the 401(k) Plan, up to 5% of the participant's eligible compensation. Prior to January 1, 2018, participants employed by the Company's cabinet components division received matching contributions equal to 35% of pre-tax  Table of Contents contributions, up to 5% of the participant's eligible compensation. The Company may, at its discretion, make profit-sharing contributions to the participants' accounts. 
        Participants will always be 100% vested in their pre-tax and after-tax contributions to the 401(k) Plan. Company matching and profit-sharing contributions vest 20% per year and are 100% vested after five years. In addition, a participant will be 100% vested in all amounts under the 401(k) Plan in the event of (i) disability prior to termination of employment, (ii) retirement or (iii) death prior to termination of employment. 
        All distributions from the 401(k) Plan will be made in a single lump sum payment. 
      Stock Purchase Plans         
   Employee Stock Purchase Plan  
        The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") is designed to provide our eligible employees the opportunity to invest in our Common Stock through voluntary payroll deductions. In addition, participating employees receive a percentage match from the Company, thereby encouraging employees to share in the Company's success and to remain in its service. The Stock Purchase Plan is not intended to meet the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
        The Stock Purchase Plan is administered by Equiniti Trust Company ("Equiniti"), who may be removed at management's election. Equiniti also serves as the transfer agent and registrar for Quanex Common Stock. 
        Regular full time employees of the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the Stock Purchase Plan. Participation in the Stock Purchase Plan is voluntary. 
   Contributions to the Stock Purchase Plan  
        Contributions to the Stock Purchase Plan consist of employees' payroll deductions and an amount from the Company equal to 15% of those deductions. The Bank establishes an account under the Stock Purchase Plan as agent for each eligible employee electing to participate in the Stock Purchase Plan and credits the following sources of cash to each employee's account for the purchase of full and fractional shares of Common Stock ("Plan Shares"):
        Participants generally may not add shares of Common Stock held in their name to their accounts. All shares are held in the name of Equiniti or its nominee as Plan Shares subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Purchase Plan. 
   Purchase of Plan Shares  
        Equiniti applies cash credited to each participant's account to the purchase of full and fractional Plan Shares and credits such Plan Shares to such participants' accounts. The price at which Equiniti is deemed to have acquired Plan Shares for accounts is the average price, excluding brokerage and other costs of purchase, of all Plan Shares purchased by Equiniti for all participants in the Stock Purchase Plan during the calendar month. Equiniti purchases Plan Shares in negotiated transactions or on any  Table of Contents securities exchange where the Company's Common Stock is traded. The purchases are on terms as to price, delivery and other matters, and are executed through those brokers or dealers, as Equiniti may determine. 
   Stock Certificates  
        Equiniti holds the Plan Shares of all participants in its name or in the name of its nominee evidenced by as many or as few certificates as the Bank determines. No certificates representing Plan Shares purchased for participants' accounts are issued to any participant unless the participant makes a request in writing or until the participant's account is terminated and the participant makes the election described below under "Termination and Withdrawal by Participants." Certificates are not issued for fewer than ten shares unless the participant's account is terminated. 
   Voting of Plan Shares  
        Equiniti will vote each participant's Plan Shares as instructed by the participant on a form to be furnished by and returned to Equiniti at least five days (or such shorter period as the law may require) before the meeting at which the Plan Shares are to be voted. The Bank will not vote Plan Shares for which no instructions are received. 
   Assignment or Sale  
        Except as otherwise described herein, participants cannot sell, pledge, or otherwise assign or transfer their accounts, any interest in their accounts or any cash or Plan Shares credited to their accounts. Any attempt to do so will be void. 
        Subject to the restrictions set forth below under "Restrictions on Resale," each participant may request that Equiniti sell:
        If a participant elects to sell all of his or her Plan Shares, such participant will be deemed to have terminated participation in the Stock Purchase Plan. 
   Termination and Withdrawal by a Participant  
        Participants may terminate their participation in the Stock Purchase Plan at any time by giving proper notice. Upon receipt of such notice, unless the participant has made a contrary election in written response to Equiniti's notice relating to such participant's account, Equiniti will send the participant a certificate or certificates representing the full Plan Shares accumulated in the participant's account and a check for the net proceeds of any fractional share in the participant's account. After the participant's withdrawal, the sale by the participant of any shares of Common Stock issued to the participant upon such withdrawal is subject to the restrictions below under "Restrictions on Resale." If a participant elects to terminate his or her participation in the Stock Purchase Plan, he or she may rejoin the Stock Purchase Plan at any time with respect to future offering periods.  Table of Contents
   Restrictions on Resale  
        The Company's officers, directors and affiliates (as defined by the relevant securities laws) are subject to certain restrictions on resale that apply to sales by (i) Equiniti on their behalf of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan and (ii) the participant, after he or she withdraws from the Stock Purchase Plan, of shares of Common Stock issued to the participant upon his or her withdrawal from the Stock Purchase Plan. 
      Nonqualified Defined Benefit and Other Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans         
        The Company's directors, executive officers, key management and highly compensated employees are eligible to participate in certain non-tax qualified plans described below. 
   2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended  
        The Company recognizes the importance of aligning the interests of its directors, officers, and employees with those of its stockholders. This alignment of interests is reflected in the Omnibus Plan, which provides those persons who have substantial responsibility for the management and growth of the Company and its affiliates with additional performance incentives and an opportunity to obtain or increase their proprietary interest in the Company, thereby encouraging them to continue in their employment or affiliation with the Company and its affiliates. 
        The Omnibus Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share awards, performance unit awards, annual incentive awards, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards. Certain awards under the Omnibus Plan may be paid in cash or in Common Stock. Eligibility will be determined by the Compensation Committee, which has exclusive authority to select the officer and employee participants to whom awards may be granted, and may determine the type, size and terms of each award. The Compensation Committee will also make all determinations that it decides are necessary or desirable in the interpretation and administration of the Omnibus Plan. 
   Deferred Compensation Plan  
        The Company maintains the Quanex Building Products Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"), a plan not intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows certain highly compensated management personnel and directors to defer all or a portion of their directors' fees, certain compensation under the Omnibus Plan and compensation under the Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP"). 
        None of the named executive officers maintained a deferred compensation plan account balance during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and, therefore, there were no related contributions, earnings or withdrawals during fiscal 2018. 
   Eligibility and Participation  
        The individuals who are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan are key employees in the Omnibus Plan and the MIP, and all of the Company's directors, subject to additional eligibility requirements for participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan as the Compensation Committee may determine from time to time. 
   Deferral Elections  
        A participant may elect, during the designated election periods, (1) the percentage of his bonus awarded under the MIP (an "Incentive Bonus") earned during the applicable year to be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan; (2) the percentage of his compensation earned under the Omnibus  Table of Contents
Plan during the applicable year ("Omnibus Compensation") to be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan; (3) the percentage of his director fees earned during the applicable year to be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan; (4) the percentage to be deferred in the form of deemed shares of Common Stock or other investment funds provided under the Deferred Compensation Plan; (5) the length of the period for deferral; and (6) the form of payment at the end of the period for deferral (either a lump sum, or quarterly or annual installment payments over a period of time of not less than three nor more than 20 years). All elections made are irrevocable once they are made for a given plan year, except for the election as to how the distribution is to be made or as otherwise permitted under applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance. That election can be changed if the change is made at least 12 months prior to the end of the deferral period, is not effective for at least 12 months and the scheduled payment is no earlier than five years after the date on which the payment would have otherwise have been made or commenced. If the election of the form of distribution is changed and an event causing distribution occurs within one year, the change in election will be ineffective and the original election will remain in effect. 
        The deferrals in the form of deemed shares of Common Stock elected by all participants in any plan year will not be allowed to exceed 3% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the first day of the plan year. 
   Company Match  
        Previously, if a participant elected to defer a portion of his Incentive Bonus, Omnibus Compensation or director fees under the Deferred Compensation Plan in the form of deemed shares of the Company's Common Stock for a period of three full years or more, the Company provided a matching award of additional deemed shares of Common Stock equal to 20% of the amount deferred, excluding deferrals of long-term incentives, in the form of deemed shares of our Common Stock. The Company suspended its matching award effective April 1, 2009. 
   The Participant's Account  
        Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, an account is established for each participant, which the Company maintains. The account reflects the amount of the obligation to the participant at any given time (comprising the amount of compensation deferred for the participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company match, if any, and the amount of income credited on each of these amounts). If the participant elects his deferral to be in the form of deemed shares of our Common Stock, the number of shares credited to his account as Common Stock will be the number of shares of our Common Stock that could have been purchased with the dollar amount deferred, without taking into account any brokerage fees, taxes or other expenses that might be incurred in such a transaction, based upon the closing quotation on the NYSE on the date the amount would have been paid had it not been deferred. In addition to the option to hold the account as deemed shares of Common Stock, the participant may choose from a variety of investment choices. 
   Dividends and Distributions Associated with Company Common Stock.  
        When dividends or other distributions are declared and paid on the Company's Common Stock, those dividends and other distributions will be accrued in a participant's account based upon the shares of Common Stock deemed credited to the participant's account. Such amounts credited to a participant's account will vest at the same time the underlying deemed shares of Common Stock vest and will be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions. The dividends or other distributions, whether stock, property, cash or other rights, are credited to the account as additional deemed shares of the Company's Common Stock. For this purpose, all dividends and distributions not in the form of deemed shares of the Company's Common Stock or cash are valued at the fair market value as determined by the Compensation Committee.  Table of Contents
   Common Stock Conversion Election  
        At any time during a period commencing three years prior to the earliest time a participant could retire under the Pension Plan and ending on the participant's normal retirement date as established under the Pension Plan, the participant is allowed to elect a retirement date under the Pension Plan and may elect to have all deemed shares of Common Stock in his account converted to cash and deemed to be invested in the participant's selected investment options. At any time which is at least three years after deemed Common Stock is credited to a participant's account, the participant is allowed to elect to have such deemed Common Stock converted to cash and deemed to be invested in the participant's selected investment options. 
   Vesting  
        All deferrals of the Incentive Bonus, Omnibus Compensation and director fees are 100% vested at all times, except in the event of forfeiture as described below. Company matching contributions and dividends are 100% vested after the earliest of (i) three years after the applicable deemed share of Common Stock is credited to the participant's account, (ii) the participant's death, (iii) the participant's termination of employment due to disability or (iv) the participant's retirement. 
        If the Compensation Committee finds that the participant was discharged by the Company for fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony, proven dishonesty in the course of his employment by the Company that damaged the Company, for disclosing its trade secrets, or for competing directly or indirectly with the Company at any time during the first two years following his termination of employment, the entire amount credited to his account, exclusive of the total deferrals of the participant, will be forfeited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such forfeitures will not apply to a participant discharged during the plan year in which a change of control occurs. 
   Distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan  
        Upon a distribution or withdrawal, the balance of all amounts deemed invested in investment funds and the number of deemed shares of Common Stock credited to the participant and required to be distributed is distributed in cash, whether the distribution or withdrawal is in a lump sum or in installments. The value per deemed share of common stock will be calculated based on the closing quotation for the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE. Distributions are made with respect to a participant's interest in the Deferred Compensation Plan upon the expiration of the term of deferral as was previously elected by the participant or upon the participant's earlier death or disability. A withdrawal may be made by the participant prior to an event causing distribution, in an amount needed to satisfy an emergency or in certain unforeseeable events of hardship beyond the control of the participant, as approved by the Compensation Committee. 
        The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Table of Contents

      Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance         
        Under SEC rules, the Company's directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's equity securities are required to file certain reports of their ownership, and changes in that ownership, with the SEC. Based solely on its review of copies of these reports and representations of such reporting persons, the Company believes that all such SEC filing requirements were satisfied during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE         
        The following sections of this Proxy Statement provide an overview of the Company's corporate governance structure, including our Board leadership structure, certain responsibilities and activities of the Board and its Committees and independence and other criteria we use in selecting Director nominees. We also discuss how our stockholders and other stakeholders can communicate with the Board of Directors. 
      Completed Governance Initiative—Board Declassification         
        The Company takes good corporate governance extremely seriously and is committed to evolving to meet—and exceed—corporate governance best practices. To this end, following a careful review of the Company's practices, the Board adopted a number of governance reforms in 2015 and 2016, including a phased declassification of the Board to be achieved over three years. Director nominees at the 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings were nominated for terms of only one year, and the same is true for director nominees at the upcoming 2019 Annual Meeting. All future director terms will also be for terms of only one year. As a result, we consider the Board to now be fully declassified. 
      Corporate Governance Guidelines         
        The following corporate governance guidelines have been adopted by the Board of Directors as the framework within which directors and management can effectively pursue the Company's objectives of adding to stockholder value. These guidelines reflect the practices and principles by which the Company operates. The Board periodically reviews and may update these guidelines and other corporate governance matters.

    STRUCTURE AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
        The Company's Board consists of six directors. All directors other than Mr. Griffiths are independent in accordance with the independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's independent directors sit on all of the three primary committees. Therefore the Audit, Compensation & Management Development, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees are all comprised solely of independent directors. In addition, the Board selects a separate independent Lead Director. Currently, Mr. Rupp serves as the independent Lead Director. 
        The Board believes that its leadership structure is best for the Company at the current time. The Board believes that a number of advantages are gained by combining the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer along with an appropriately empowered Lead Director. By vesting chairmanship duties in the Chief Executive Officer, the Board is effectively providing a leadership role to the director who is most familiar with the Company's business and industry, most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities, and most effective at leading the strategic discussions that will drive the Company's future. By allowing the Chief Executive Officer to lead meetings and discussions, the Board ensures that its focus remains on those items that are most important to the business and its strategic direction, while allowing independent directors to provide advice and oversight based on their own valuable experience and expertise. It also allows for a more effective flow of information between the Board and management, improving efficiency and reducing confusion about the Company's strategic and operational directions. Further, combining the roles provides for strong and stable leadership vested in a single person, thereby avoiding confusion and providing appropriate accountability for the Company's leader. The Board and the Lead Director ensure this accountability by providing oversight of the Chairman and CEO, both directly by the Lead Director through personal conversations with the Chairman and CEO, and also by the Board through its annual CEO performance reviews and periodic director performance reviews. 
        The Company's independent directors meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions at each of the Company's regular Board meetings, without management present and with the Lead Director presiding. The Lead Director is actively engaged in facilitating communication with the individual directors and the CEO, and provides guidance and counsel to the CEO on behalf of the independent directors. 
        In addition, the Lead Director is responsible for chairing the Board in the absence of the Chairman; acting as liaison between the Board and the Chairman; assisting the Chairman in setting the agenda for Board meetings; ensuring that there are adequate opportunities for executive sessions of the directors and communicating the results of all such sessions; participating in one-on-one discussions with individual directors as requested by the Governance Committee; and working with the Chairman to form Special Committees of the Board, if necessary. 
        During fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors met eleven times, and the independent directors met five times in executive session with the Lead Director presiding. In addition, the Audit Committee met five times, the Compensation & Management Development Committee met three times, and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee met three times. The Executive Committee did not meet. All directors attended more than 75% of the combined number of Board meetings and meetings of committees of which they are members. The Company's Board of Directors holds a meeting immediately following each year's annual meeting of stockholders. Therefore, members of the Company's Board of Directors generally attend the Company's annual stockholder meetings. All Board members attended the 2018 stockholders' meeting. 
      Audit Committee         
        The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Buck, Nosbaum, and Stevens (Chairman), each of whom satisfies the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the 1934 Act  Table of Contents and meets the definitions of "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 of the 1934 Act and "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition, all members of the Audit Committee have been designated "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
        The Audit Committee's responsibilities to the Board are detailed in the written Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Company's Board of Directors, which is posted on the Company's website at www.quanex.com and incorporated in this Proxy Statement by reference. The Audit Committee's primary functions include monitoring the integrity of the Company's financial reporting process, reviewing the Company's system of internal financial and disclosure controls and the performance of the Company's internal audit function, overseeing the Company's annual independent audit and its public accountant's qualifications and independence, and reviewing compliance with applicable laws and regulations which may represent material financial exposure to the Company. Interested Stockholders may also obtain a copy of the Audit Committee Charter, free of charge, by contacting the Company at the address or phone number listed in the section entitled "Communications with the Company". 
   Audit Committee Report to Stockholders  
        We have reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2018, with senior management and with Grant Thornton LLP, certified public accountants and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, we have reviewed and discussed with senior management the design and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and have further reviewed and discussed the opinion and audit of Grant Thornton LLP regarding those controls. We have also discussed various other matters with Grant Thornton LLP related to the Company's consolidated financial statements, including critical accounting policies and practices used, potential alternative treatments for material items that have been discussed with the Company, and all other material written communications between the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company. 
        We have reviewed and discussed with Grant Thornton LLP all communications required by auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including those described in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees", and the SEC's Rule 2-07, "Communication with Audit Committees" of Regulation S-X. In addition, we have received and reviewed the written disclosures and the written letter from Grant Thornton LLP regarding its independence, as required by applicable standards of the PCAOB and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. We have also discussed with Grant Thornton LLP its independence in connection with its audit of the Company's most recent financial statements, and we have reviewed and approved the non-audit services rendered by Grant Thornton LLP and approved all fees paid for audit and non-audit services. Following this review, we are satisfied with Grant Thornton LLP's independence from the Company. 
        Based on the various reviews and discussions mentioned above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Procedures for Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services  
        Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving, in advance, any audit and any permissible non-audit engagement between the Company and its independent auditors. Grant Thornton LLP's engagement to conduct the audit of Quanex Building Products Corporation for fiscal 2018 was approved by the Audit Committee on January 24, 2018. Additionally, each permissible audit and non-audit engagement or relationship between the Company and Grant Thornton LLP entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee, as provided in its charter. 
        We have been advised by Grant Thornton LLP that substantially all of the work done in conjunction with its audit of the Company's financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year was performed by full-time employees and partners of Grant Thornton LLP. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of services rendered for all other fees, as described above, is compatible with maintaining independence of Grant Thornton LLP.  Table of Contents
      Compensation & Management Development Committee         
        The current members of the Compensation & Management Development Committee are Messrs. Rupp and Nosbaum and Ms. Davis (Chairwoman). The Compensation & Management Development Committee's responsibilities to the Board are detailed in the Compensation & Management Development Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's website at www.quanex.com and incorporated in this Proxy Statement by reference.

Interested Stockholders may also obtain a copy of the Compensation & Management Development Committee Charter, free of charge, by contacting the Company at the address and phone number listed in the section entitled "Communications with the Company". 
        During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, each of Ms. Davis and Messrs.

   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  
        None of our employees, officers or former officers serve (or served during the last fiscal year) as a member of our compensation committee. None of our executive officers serve (or served during the last fiscal year) as a member of the board of directors of any other company of which any member of our compensation committee or Board of Directors is an executive officer.

      Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee         
        All directors other than Mr. Griffiths serve as members of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, with Mr. Rupp acting as Chairman. Each member of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee satisfies the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC. 
        The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee's responsibilities to the Board are detailed in the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Charter available on the Company's website at www.quanex.com and incorporated herein by reference. Interested Stockholders may also obtain a copy of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee Charter, free of charge, by contacting the Company at the address or phone number listed in the section entitled "Communications with the Company" on page 63 of this Proxy Statement. 
        The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee develops and maintains qualification criteria and procedures for the identification and recruitment of candidates for election to serve as directors of the Company. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee relies on the knowledge and relationships of the Company and its officers and directors, as well as third parties when it deems necessary, to identify and evaluate nominees for director, including nominees recommended by stockholders. Although the Company has no formal policy on diversity for board members, the board considers diversity of experience and background in an effort to ensure that the composition of our directors creates a strong and effective board. 
        The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth age limitations for directors and require that a majority of our directors be independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC. In addition, the Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the minimum qualifications for a director and provide that the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will be responsible for establishing additional qualifications for directors, taking into account the composition and skills of the entire Board. In general, persons considered for Board positions must have demonstrated leadership capabilities, be of sound mind and high moral character, have no personal or financial interest that would conflict with the interests of the Company, possess certain key attributes that benefit the Company, and be willing and able to commit the necessary time for Board and committee service. 
        Subject to certain exceptions as set out in its charter, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and pre-approving any financial arrangement, transaction or relationship (including indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness), or series of similar transactions within a fiscal year, in which the Company is a participant, any related party has a direct or indirect material interest, and the amount involved is $100,000 or more. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is further responsible for providing advance approval of any charitable contribution made on behalf of a related party or to an organization where a related party is an officer or director, if the amount involved is $10,000 or more within a fiscal year, and the Company is a direct or indirect participant. 
   Nomination of Directors  
        The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominees recommended by stockholders of the Company in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee's charter and the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws. Under its charter, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees for director recommended by stockholders of the Company, provided such recommendations are addressed to the chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee at the Company's principal executive office and received by the Chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the time limits set forth in the Company's Bylaws. The  Table of Contents
Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws in turn provide that, subject to certain limitations discussed below, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as director at the meeting. The Company's Bylaws also provide that a stockholder must give written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, which must be delivered to or mailed and received at the Company's principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 60 days later than the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting, the notice must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which a written statement setting forth the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed to stockholders or the date on which it is first disclosed to the public. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased board of directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company. From time to time, the Company may engage outside director search firms to assist in identifying and recruiting appropriate director nominees. 
        There are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee or by a stockholder. 
      Executive Committee         
        The current members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Rupp, Stevens and Griffiths, who is Chairman. When necessary, the Executive Committee acts on behalf of the Board between regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors. Mr. Rupp currently serves as the Board's Lead Director. 
      Risk Oversight         
        Our Board is responsible for oversight of the Company's risk assessment and management process. The Board delegated to the Compensation & Management Development Committee basic responsibility for oversight of management's compensation risk assessment, and the Committee reports to the Board on its review. The Board also delegated tasks related to risk process oversight to the Audit Committee, which reports the results of its review to the Board. In addition to the reports from the Audit and Compensation & Management Development Committees, our Board periodically discusses risk oversight. The Company's Vice President of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee and has direct and unrestricted access to the Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee meets in executive session at each of its meetings with the Vice President of Internal Audit, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, and a representative of the Company's outside auditor. The Company's General Counsel also updates the Board at each of its meetings.  Table of Contents

      Other Matters, Stockholder Nominations, and Stockholder Proposals         
        At the date of this Proxy Statement, management is not aware of any matters to be presented for action at the meeting other than those described above. However, if any other matters should come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the accompanying proxy card to vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters. 
        To be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to our next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act must be received at 1800 West Loop South, Suite 1500, Houston, Texas 77027, Attn: Corporate Secretary, no later than October 30, 2019. We have not yet determined when we will hold our next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If we determine to hold such meeting more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of the Annual Meeting, we will publicly announce such date to stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        The Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, for business to be properly brought before an Annual Meeting by a stockholder (including director nominations by stockholders or stockholder proposals outside the processes of Rule 14a-8), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company, not less than 90 days (which for the 2019 meeting would be December 23, 2019) nor more than 120 days (which for the 2019 meeting would be November 23, 2019) prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 60 days (which for the 2018 meeting would be May 21, 2020) later than the anniversary date of the immediately preceding Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which a written statement setting forth the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed to stockholders or the date on which it is first disclosed to the public.
