       In 2019, we will continue to focus on profitability, improving operating execution, and increased accountability across the company, while delivering on our four strategic imperatives: people, innovation, growth and performance.   Dear Fellow Shareholder:      Axalta continued to perform as a global leader in the coatings industry in 2018. Our overall financial results for the year reflected strong execution by our team despite headwinds from inflation, foreign exchange and the automotive markets. Our company continues to demonstrate strength and the ability to grow even in challenging market conditions.      In 2018, we introduced over 250 new products across Axalta, beating our target for the third year in a row. To ensure we continue to deliver innovative new products that our customers demand, we officially opened the Axalta Global Innovation Center (GIC) in November – the world's largest R&D center dedicated to coatings and color. Each of our business segments are serviced from the GIC, and we remain more committed than ever to delivering new products such as Cromax® EZ, Imron® 3.5 and Eleglas™, which were all major product launches for Axalta in 2018.      In 2019, we will continue to focus on profitability, improving operating execution, and increased accountability across the company, while delivering on our four strategic imperatives: people, innovation, growth and performance. We expect another successful year for Axalta.     You are cordially invited to learn more about our business and progress on our strategic plan at our 2019 Annual General Meeting of Members to be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 1:00 p.m., local time, at Convene, 2001 Market Street, 2nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103.

In addition, the Audit Committee oversees cybersecurity risks facing the Company, which are also regularly reviewed by the full Board. The EHS&S Committee is tasked with overseeing management's monitoring and enforcement of the Company's policies to protect the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, the public and the environment. The Compensation Committee and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee oversee risks associated with executive and employee compensation and corporate governance matters, respectively.The full Board considers specific risk topics, including risks involved with CEO and management succession planning, risk-related issues pertaining to laws and regulations enforced by the United States and foreign government regulators, and risks associated with our business plan, strategies and capital structure. In addition, the Board receives reports from members of our management that include discussions of the risks and exposures involved with their respective areas of responsibility, and the Board is routinely informed of developments that could affect our risk profile or other aspects of our business.

In addition, the Board considered the fact that Mr. Smolik serves on the Ducks Unlimited Conservation Programs Committee and the Boards of Directors of Ducks Unlimited, Inc. and Ducks Unlimited de Mexico on a volunteer basis, and that the Company provides annual corporate support to Ducks Unlimited and Ducks Unlimited de Mexico at a level well below 2% of the organization's gross revenues, and did so prior to Mr. Smolik joining the Board. In each case, the Board considered the magnitude and nature of these relationships and determined that they did not impair the independence of Ms. Lempres or Mr. Smolik.

and refreshment as additional relevant criteria in its identification, consideration and recommendation of director candidates. When considering whether our directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board of Directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board focused primarily on each person's background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors' individual biographies set forth in "Proposal No. 1: Election of Two Class II Directors." We believe that our directors provide an appropriate diversity of experience and skills for the size and nature of our business.
Under the transition plan to eliminate our classified board structure, as approved by shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting, Class I directors elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting, the nominees for election as Class II directors at this year's Annual Meeting and the nominees for election as Class III directors at the Annual General Meeting of Members in 2020 will each serve terms expiring at the Annual General Meeting of Members in 2021. At that time, our classified board structure will expire and the entire Board will be elected annually. Any directors appointed by the Board to fill vacancies after such time would serve only until the next election of directors by the shareholders or until a director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

candidates on the Company's succession plan. With the assistance of national search firms, the Board evaluated a slate of qualified candidates and ultimately named Terrence S. Hahn as CEO, effective September 4, 2018. In October, Mr. Hahn resigned by mutual agreement with the Board following an investigation by outside counsel into conduct by Mr. Hahn unrelated to financial matters that Axalta believes was inconsistent with Company policies. Following this subsequent and unexpected change in CEO, the Board consulted the Company's succession plans (including emergency scenario contingency planning) and appointed Mr. Bryant, who was then serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as interim CEO. During the following interim period, the Board conducted a thorough evaluation of the needs of the Company and received feedback from investors, employees and other stakeholders. After reviewing multiple options and carefully considering Mr. Bryant's qualifications, the Board named him as our CEO on a permanent basis in December 2018. Additional details including related compensation actions are described below under "2018 CEO Transitions" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement.

The Compensation Committee in December 2018 reviewed a peer comparison of director compensation conducted by Deloitte Consulting LLP. Following such review, the Compensation Committee recommended no changes to the components and amounts of non-employee director compensation for 2019.

The Audit Committee discussed and determined that PwC's performance of the tax services would not impair its independence. Nonetheless, our Audit Committee has instructed PwC and management that, absent extenuating circumstances, PwC's audit, audit-related and compliance fees should comprise a majority of its overall fees.
individual engagements may be separately approved by the Audit Committee prior to the services being performed. However, the authority to pre-approve up to $500,000 per engagement has been delegated to the Audit Committee Chair to accommodate time-sensitive service proposals and the Audit Committee Chair reports any such pre-approvals to the full committee at the next meeting. In each case, the Audit Committee considers whether the provision of such services would impair the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. All audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services provided by PwC for 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Members."As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Board of Directors believes that the Company's long-term success depends in large measure on the talents of our employees.

we delivered cash from operations of $496 million. However, these accomplishments fell short of certain targets for the year and this Company performance, along with the individual performance and key achievements of each NEO, was reflected in the compensation paid to our NEOs in 2018, as described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Annual Bonus Plan  
• Corporate Adjusted EBITDA was below target performance, resulting in a payout of 90% for this metric  
• Corporate Adjusted Free Cash Flow was below target performance, resulting in a payout of 85% for this metric  
• Adjusted EBITDA for our business units were at or below target performance, resulting in payouts of 99%, 100% and 75% for our Refinish, Industrial and Transportation businesses, respectively  
• Adjusted EBITDA for our regions led by NEOs were below target performance, resulting in payouts of 77% and 0% for our EMEA and Greater China regions, respectively  
• Free Cash Flow for our regions led by NEOs were below threshold performance, resulting in payouts of 0% for both of our EMEA and Greater China regions  
• Our NEOs delivered on various key leadership objectives (detailed below), resulting in payouts ranging from 100% to 175% for the individual performance component  
 2016-2018 Performance Stock Awards   
• Axalta's relative total shareholder return was below the 30th percentile of the relevant performance peer group, resulting in no performance shares being earned for this performance period

packages for the new CEOs and new CFO and retention stock awards for senior management, were intended to attract and retain new leadership while also ensuring stability and continuity among the senior management team through the transitions, in a manner consistent with our compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee believes these decisions, which resulted from a unique set of circumstances that we do not expect to reoccur, were critical to successfully navigating through the transitions and challenging market conditions in 2018 and positioning Axalta for continued success in 2019 and future years.

 Annual performance-based compensation• Eliminated the Constant Currency Net Sales metric while increasing the weighting of the Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow metrics• Increases focus on profitability metrics  
• Realigned financial metrics for business unit employees to business-unit specific metrics and introduced new operational and technology metrics• Increases correlation between annual bonus earned and metrics actually impacted by employees  
 Long-term equity incentive awards• Changed the comparative group for performance stock awards from a defined performance peer group to the S&P 500• Provides more accurate assessment of the Company's relative financial performance over the 3-year performance period  
• Introduced several new design features in our Amended and Restated 2014 Incentive Award Plan, including minimum 12-month vesting periods (subject to certain exceptions) and prohibitions on liberal share recycling practices, option repricing and payment of dividends until the related award vests• Implements best practices that protect the interests of our shareholders   
• Updated equity award agreements to include non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions• Provides appropriate protection for the Company and its shareholders

 Base compensation   To recognize performance of job responsibilities and to attract and retain individuals with superior talent.  
 Annual performance-based compensation   To promote our near-term performance objectives across our workforce and reward individual contributions to the achievement of those objectives.  
 Long-term equity incentive awards   To emphasize our long-term performance objectives, encourage the maximization of shareholder value and retain key executives by providing an opportunity to participate in the ownership of our common shares.  
 Defined contribution plans    To provide an opportunity for tax-efficient savings and long-term financial security.  
 Severance arrangements   To encourage the continued attention and dedication of key individuals, in particular when considering strategic alternatives.

performance of the Company. In particular, the extended option exercise period was provided to allow for a more orderly disposition of Mr. Shaver's options granted prior to our IPO than might otherwise be necessitated by the standard option exercise period of six months following termination of service to the Company. Following Mr. Shaver's resignation, the Board appointed Mr. Hahn as Chief Executive Officer and President, effective September 4, 2018. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Hahn received: (1) a $500,000 cash sign-on bonus, (2) sign-on equity awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of $2,500,000, (3) a prorated annual long-term incentive award for 2018 with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $1,385,616, (4) an annual base salary of $950,000, (5) an incentive target of 110% of his base salary under Axalta's annual incentive program, and (6) reimbursement for certain other expenses incurred in

$4 million and the payment of Mr. Hahn's legal fees, in the event of a finding that Mr. Hahn was terminated without "cause" under the terms of the Executive Restrictive Covenant and Severance Agreement that Mr. Hahn entered into when he joined Axalta, as well as any other damages that Mr. Hahn may have claimed in connection with his resignation. The Board also considered the ability of the Company to provide timely public disclosure regarding the circumstances of the separation without risk of litigation, as well as the fact that the stock options Mr. Hahn retained under the Separation Agreement (comprising 50% of Mr. Hahn's sign-on equity award) had relatively little value at the time of entering into the Separation Agreement (given that such options had an exercise price of $29.40 and that such options would expire six months after Mr. Hahn's resignation in accordance with the standard terms of the Company's equity award agreements). Immediately following Mr. Hahn's resignation, the Board appointed Mr. Bryant, Axalta's then-Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to serve in the additional role of interim Chief Executive Officer, and on October 12, 2018, the Board appointed Mr. Lannon, Axalta's then-Vice President, Corporate Finance and Global Controller, to serve as interim Chief Financial Officer. Following these appointments, the Board adjusted the base salaries and annual incentive targets for Messrs. Bryant and Lannon to levels commensurate with their interim positions, as described in more detail below under "Elements of 2018 Compensation Program." On December 10, 2018, the Board appointed Mr. Bryant to serve in the role of Chief Executive Officer and President and appointed Mr. Lannon to serve in the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, each on a permanent basis. In addition, the Board appointed Mr. Bryant as a Class I director.
Committee is primarily responsible for: (i) determining any future adjustments to base salary and target annual performance-based award levels (representing the non-equity incentive compensation that may be awarded expressed as a percentage of base salary or as a dollar amount for the year); (ii) assessing the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs for each applicable performance period; and (iii) determining the awards to be paid to our Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs under the long-term equity incentive program for each year. The Compensation Committee is also delegated authority to administer our Amended and Restated 2014 Incentive Award Plan and approve equity grants under the plan.

The minimum award under the payout matrix (i.e., 50% of the target award) is payable only upon achievement of the threshold performance goals for each financial performance metric. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the minimum achievement threshold for each financial performance metric was 85% (i.e., >85% of Adjusted EBITDA, and >85% of Adjusted Free Cash Flow). If the threshold performance goal for a financial performance metric is not achieved, the award for that metric is zero. The maximum award under the payout matrix (i.e., 200% of the target award) is payable only upon achievement of maximum-level performance goals for each financial performance metric (i.e., 117% of Adjusted EBITDA and 117% of Adjusted Free Cash Flow). Award amounts increase linearly with a 3.3:1 slope between threshold and target-level financial performance and linearly with a 6:1 slope between target and maximum-level financial performance.For the individual performance component, the Compensation Committee provides each NEO with an individual performance factor reflecting the Compensation Committee's assessment of each NEO's performance, business impact, contributions and leadership, among other factors. The individual performance factor can range from 0 to 200%.

 Our NEOs are eligible to receive long-term equity incentive awards pursuant to our long-term incentive programs as in effect from time to time. In 2018, our NEOs received long-term incentive awards under our Amended and Restated 2014 Incentive Award Plan. The balanced portfolio of 50% performance stock/performance share unit awards (PSAs), 25% stock options and 25% restricted stock/restricted stock unit awards (RSAs) that were granted in 2018 is designed to motivate and retain our executives by providing an opportunity for them to share in increases in the value of our common shares, as well as the opportunity to immediately enhance their ownership in Company stock. All equity types are each subject to a risk of forfeiture should the executive's employment terminate prior to the vesting date absent certain exceptions.

The 2% company contribution was discretionary based on Company financial performance for years prior to 2019 and became non-discretionary in fiscal year 2019. Participants are 100% vested in all contributions, including company contributions. The 401(k) Plan is offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to all of our U.S. salaried employees, including the NEOs.
The Axalta Coating Systems, LLC Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan became effective June 1, 2014. Members of our senior management team, including our NEOs, are eligible to defer up to 100% of their base salary in excess of the annual limits under section 401(a)(17) of the Code to this plan, provided that these individuals first maximize their elective deferrals to the 401(k) Plan. Participants in the plan may also defer future bonus amounts. This plan provides for an excess matching contribution and an excess non-elective contribution, each provided at the Company's discretion, as well as an additional discretionary contribution as determined by the Compensation Committee.

reaching this conclusion, we evaluated our global employee population as of October 15, 2018 of approximately 13,122 individuals, which includes the employees from 2017 acquisitions that were excluded from our 2017 calculation. From this we excluded 652 employees in 16 countries under the 5% de minimis exemption as permitted under SEC rules, resulting in a remainder of 12,470 employees. Excluded employee counts are as follows: Argentina (67), Costa Rica (4), Dominican Republic (17), Ecuador (14), El Salvador (10), Guatemala (200), Honduras (20), Indonesia (95), Japan (37), Morocco (9), Nicaragua (12), Panama (18), Russia (33), South Africa (22), Turkey (86) and Vietnam (8).We determined the median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was $65,530. As disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54, the annual total compensation for 2018 of our current Chief Executive Officer, Robert Bryant, was $4,624,393, annualizing his base salary as of October 15, 2018 following his appointment as interim Chief Executive Officer as further described under "2018 CEO Transitions" above. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to that of our median employee was 71:1.We note that Mr. Bryant's annual total compensation for 2018 used in calculating our pay ratio includes his 2018 annual bonus and long-term equity incentive compensation amounts which do not reflect full-year compensation commensurate with the CEO position. Therefore, our CEO pay ratio for 2018 is substantially lower than our 2017 ratio and may be lower than our ratio in future years.
