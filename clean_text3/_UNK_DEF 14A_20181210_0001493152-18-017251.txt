JOBS Act Explanatory Note
We are an "emerging growth company" under applicable federal securities laws and are therefore permitted to take advantage of certain reduced public company reporting requirements. As an emerging growth company, we provide in this proxy statement the scaled disclosure permitted under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, including the compensation disclosures required of a "smaller reporting company," as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to conduct votes seeking approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers or the frequency with which such votes must be conducted. We will remain an "emerging growth company" until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities of the issuer under an effective Securities Act registration statement, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer" as defined in the Exchange Act.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING
Why am I receiving these materials?
The Board of the Company is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Meeting, including any adjournments or postponements of the Meeting. On or about December 12, 2018, we will mail the proxy materials to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Meeting. You are invited to attend the Meeting to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may sign and return a proxy card. Additional information on how you may vote can be found below under "How do I vote?"
How do I attend the Meeting?
The Meeting will be held on Wednesday December 26, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time at 999 Vanderbilt Beach Rd., Suite 605, Naples, Florida 34108. Information regarding directions to the Meeting may be obtained by email at ir@ftenet.com or by telephone at 877-850-4308. Information on how to vote in person at the Meeting is provided below. Only stockholders and authorized guests of the Company may attend the meeting, and all attendees will be required to show a valid form of ID (such as a government-issued form of photo identification). If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a bank or broker), you must also provide proof of share ownership, such as a letter from your bank or broker or a recent brokerage statement.
Who can vote at the Meeting?
Only stockholders of record on November 23, 2018, will be entitled to vote at the Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 18,047,233 shares entitled to vote, including shares of our preferred stock, which entitles the holder thereof to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which such shares are convertible as of the Record Date.
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If on November 23, 2018, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Nevada Agency and Transfer Company, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, we urge you to fill out and return the enclosed proxy card to ensure your vote is counted.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If on November 23, 2018, your shares were not held in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Meeting in person. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other agent.
What am I voting on?
There are three matters scheduled for a vote:
What if another matter is properly brought before the Meeting?
Our board of directors knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.
How do I vote?
You may either vote "For" all the nominees to our board of directors or you may "Withhold" your vote for any nominee you specify. For the other matters to be voted on, you may vote "For" or "Against" or you may abstain from voting, by checking the related box. The procedures for voting are as follows:
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Meeting or by proxy using the proxy card enclosed with your mailed proxy materials. Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the Meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you should have received a voting instruction form with your proxy materials containing voting instructions from that organization rather than from the Company. Simply complete and mail the voting instruction form or follow the voting instructions in the proxy materials to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote in person at the Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or bank included with your mailed proxy materials, or contact your broker or bank, to request a proxy form.
How many votes do I have?
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of common stock you own as of November 23, 2018.
What happens if I do not vote?
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record and do not vote by completing your proxy card or in person at the Meeting, your shares will not be voted.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner and do not instruct your broker, bank or other agent how to vote your shares, the question of whether your broker or nominee will still be able to vote your shares depends on whether the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") deems the particular proposal to be a "routine" matter. Brokers and nominees can use their discretion to vote "uninstructed" shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters. Under the rules and interpretations of the NYSE, "non-routine matters" are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such as mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation and certain corporate governance proposals, such as certificate of incorporation amendments, even if management-supported. Accordingly, your broker or nominee may not vote your shares on Proposals 1 and 3, without your instructions, but may vote your shares on Proposal 2.
What if I return a proxy card or otherwise vote but do not make specific choices?
If you return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise vote without marking voting selections, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of the director nominees listed in this proxy statement, "FOR" approval of proposed amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, and "FOR" ratification of the appointment of Marcum as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. If any other matter is properly presented at the Meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his best judgment.
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, over the telephone or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We also will reimburse brokerage firms, banks, nominees and other persons holding shares for others for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their proxies.
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
If you receive more than one set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in different accounts. Please follow the voting instructions to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the Meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:
Your most current proxy card received before the beginning of voting is the one that is counted.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker or bank.
What are "broker non-votes"?
As discussed above, when a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" does not give instructions to the broker, bank, custodian or other nominee holding the shares as to how to vote on matters deemed by the NYSE to be "non-routine," the broker or nominee cannot vote the shares. These un-voted shares are counted as "broker non-votes."
What is the quorum requirement?
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. Under our Bylaws, a quorum will be present if stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote are present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and (because there is at least one "routine" matter to be voted on at the Meeting) broker non-votes will also be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. As of the Record Date, there were 18,047,233 shares entitled to vote, including shares of our preferred stock, which entitles the holder thereof to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which such shares are convertible as of the Record Date. Thus, the holders of 9,204,089 shares must be present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting to have a quorum.
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
Votes will be counted by the inspector of elections appointed for the Meeting, who will separately count votes "For" and "Against," abstentions or withheld votes, and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Votes withheld and broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 1 will have no effect and will not be counted for the purposes of the vote for Proposal 1. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if applicable on Proposal 3) will be counted for the purposes of the vote total for Proposals 2 and 3 and will have the same effect as "Against" votes. The only routine matter on which brokers may vote without instructions is Proposal 2.
The following table describes the voting requirements for each proposal, including the vote required to approve each proposal and the effect that abstentions or broker non-votes will have on the outcome of the proposal:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal      Number   Proposal      Description   Vote      Required for Approval   Effect                                           of Abstentions   Effect                                           of Broker          Non-Votes

[END TABLE]
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the meeting. If there is no quorum, the holders of a majority of shares present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting to another date.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file within four business days after the Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an amended Form 8-K to publish the final results.

PROPOSAL ONE
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board is currently comprised of six (6) members. We are therefore recommending the election of six of our existing Board members at the Meeting. Our Bylaws provide for the authorization of up to seven (7) directors. Any vacancies in the Board may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, although less than quorum, during such time that our stockholders fail or are unable to fill any such vacancy. Each director so elected shall hold office for the balance of the term to which such director is elected.
Pursuant to our Bylaws, all of our directors have one-year terms and stand for election at each annual meeting. However, if Proposal 3 is approved, all of our directors will have staggered three-year terms and will stand for election upon the expiration of the term of the class to which the applicable director will be assigned by our board of directors following the Meeting. For a transition period necessary to implement Proposal 3, the initial term for Class I directors will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2019; the initial term for Class II directors will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020; and the initial term for Class III directors will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2021. After such transition period, each class will be elected for a three-year term.
Explanatory Note Regarding Future Elections of Directors Serving on a Classified Board
If our stockholders approve the Restated Certificate attached to this proxy as Appendix A, including the amendment to approve a classified board of directors as described in Proposal 3, our board of directors will be divided into three classes for future elections. Each class will consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors, and except for a transition period necessary to implement Proposal 3, each class will have a three-year term.
At the recommendation of our nominating and corporate governance committee, our board of directors proposes that the nominees named below (each, a "Nominee" and collectively, the "Nominees"), each of whom is currently serving as a director, be elected to serve as provided below and until such director's successor is elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.

[END TABLE]
Nominees for Election to the Board of Directors at the Meeting
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the Nominees. In the event that any nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as the Board may propose. Each of the Nominees has agreed to serve if elected, and we have no reason to believe that they will be unable to serve.
The Nominees, their ages and current positions with the Company are as follows:
The following is a brief description of the specific experience and qualifications, attributes or skills of each Nominee that led to the conclusion that such person should serve as a director of the Company.

The proposed amendment divides our board of directors into three classes, with each class having a three-year term expiring in a different year.
Classified Board of Directors
Nevada law provides that, unless otherwise provided in a company's articles of incorporation or bylaws, directors are elected for a one-year term at the annual meeting of stockholders. Our Bylaws currently provide for directors to be elected at each annual meeting. If adopted, Proposal 3 would amend our Articles of Incorporation to provide that our board of directors be divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, which will supersede the current provision in the Bylaws. As a result, approximately one-third of our board of directors would be elected each year. Initially, during the implementation of the classified board structure, seven directors would serve between one- to three-year terms. The two directors elected to Class I would serve for approximately one year, the two directors elected to Class II would serve for approximately two years, and the three directors elected to Class III would serve for approximately three years. After this transition, each of our directors would serve for three-year terms, with one class being elected each year. If this Proposal 3 is approved, the Amendment authorizes our board of directors to assign directors then in office to classes upon the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada of the Amendment providing for classification of the board of directors, and our board of directors will be responsible for assigning new directors to classes upon their appointment or election to the board. For additional information about the classes in which our nominees are expected to serve if Proposal 3 is approved, please see Proposal 1 regarding director elections, above.
Under our Bylaws, any vacancies in the Board may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office, although less than quorum, during such time that our stockholders fail or are unable to fill any such vacancy. Any such newly appointed director will hold office until the next election of the class for which such director has been chosen, subject to the election and qualification of a successor and to such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. If this Proposal 3 is approved, the provisions related to filling vacancies will not be changed by the Amendment.
Advantages of a Classified Board of Directors with Vacancies Filled by the Board
Our board of directors believes that a classified board of directors with three-year terms and the election of approximately one-third of the directors each year with all vacancies filled by our board of directors will help to assure the continuity and stability of our long-term policies in the future and to reduce the Company's vulnerability to hostile and potentially abusive takeover tactics that could be adverse to the best interests of the Company's stockholders. Our board of directors believes that, by encouraging potential acquirers to negotiate directly with our board of directors, thereby giving the board added leverage in such negotiations, a classified board structure will increase the likelihood of bona fide offers for the Company by serious acquirers. A classified board would not preclude unsolicited acquisition proposals but, by eliminating the threat of imminent removal, would put our board in a position to act to maximize value for all stockholders. A longer term in office also would allow our directors to stay focused on long-term value creation, without undue pressure that may come from special interest groups intent on pursuing their own agenda at the expense of the interests of the Company and its other stockholders. Further, it would enable the Company to benefit more effectively from directors' (particularly non-management directors') experience, knowledge of the Company and wisdom, while helping the Company to attract and retain highly qualified individuals willing to commit the time and dedication necessary to understand the Company, its operations and its competitive environment.
Disadvantages of a Classified Board of Directors with Vacancies Filled by the Board
While a classified board of directors with all vacancies filled by our board of directors may have the beneficial effects discussed immediately above, it may also discourage some takeover bids, including some that would otherwise allow stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price of their stock or that a majority of our stockholders otherwise believes may be in their best interests to accept or where the reason for the desired change is inadequate performance of our directors or management. Because of the additional time required to change control of our board of directors, a classified board may also make it more difficult and more expensive for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors and our Company. Currently, a change in control of our board of directors can be made by stockholders holding a plurality of the votes cast at a single annual meeting. If we establish a classified board of directors, it will take at least two annual meetings for a potential acquirer to effect a change in control of our board of directors, even if the potential acquirer were to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock.
Vote Required for Approval
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on this item will be required for approval. Abstentions and Broker non-votes will be counted as represented and entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Committees of our Board of Directors 
Committee Composition
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The following table sets forth the current membership of each of these committees:
Audit Committee
Our Audit Committee consists of Luisa Ingargiola (Chairperson), Christopher Ferguson and Patrick O'Hare, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the NYSE American rules and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Based upon past employment experience in finance and other business experience requiring accounting knowledge and financial sophistication, our Board has determined that Ms. Ingargiola is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, and that each member of our Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. We have implemented a written charter, available at www.ftenet.com, for our Audit Committee which provides that our Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things:
The Audit Committee has (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management; (ii) discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, as amended; and (iii) received the written disclosures and letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence. Based on such review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Compensation Committee
Our Compensation Committee consists of Christopher Ferguson (Chairman) and Luisa Ingargiola, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the NYSE American rules, a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We have implemented a written charter for our Compensation Committee, available at www.ftenet.com, which provides that our Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things:
The Compensation Committee has the principal responsibility for the compensation plans of the Company, particularly as applied to the compensation of executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee Charter sets forth the authority and responsibilities of the Committee for the performance evaluation and compensation of the Company's CEO, executive officers and directors, and significant compensation arrangements, plans, policies and programs of the Company. The Committee has authority to retain such outside counsel, experts and other advisors as it determines to be necessary to carry out its responsibilities, including the authority to approve an external advisor's fees and other retention terms on behalf of the Company. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, the Company shall provide appropriate funding to the Committee, as determined by the Committee in its capacity as a Committee of the Board, for payment of compensation to any outside advisors engaged by the Committee.
The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation and evaluates the CEO's performance in light of such goals and objectives. Based on this evaluation the Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the CEO; (ii) the grant of all cash based bonuses and equity compensation to the CEO; (iii) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the CEO; (iv) any CEO severance or change in control arrangement; and (v) any other CEO compensation matters as from time to time directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the CEO's compensation, the Committee considers the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at companies that the Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company's CEO in prior years.
The Committee also meets with the CEO each fiscal year to discuss the compensation programs to be in effect for the Company's executive officers for such fiscal year and to review and approve the corporate goals and objectives relevant to those programs. In light of these goals and objectives, the Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the executive officers; (ii) the grant of cash-based bonuses and equity compensation provided to the executive officers; (iii) performance targets for executive officers; (iv) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the executive officers; (v) executive officers' severance or change in control arrangements; and (vi) any other executive officer compensation matters as from time to time directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the executive officer's compensation, the Committee considers the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to executive officers at companies that the Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company's executive officers in prior years.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Patrick O'Hare (Chairman), Christopher Ferguson and Brad Mitchell, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the NYSE American rules. We have implemented corporate governance guidelines as well as a written charter for our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, available at www.ftenet.com, which provides that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things:
In making nominations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee intends to submit candidates who have high personal and professional integrity, who have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who are effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. In evaluating nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee intends to take into consideration attributes such as leadership, independence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, business experiences, industry knowledge, and diversity of viewpoints.
One of the primary responsibilities of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to make appropriate recommendations to the Board for the appointment or re-appointment of directors. The Company seeks to have directors who, in addition to relevant technical, commercial and securities expertise, meet the highest standards of personal integrity, judgment and critical thinking, and an ability to work in an open environment with other directors to further the interests of the Company and its shareholders. In recommending appointments to the Board, the Committee is mindful of the overall balance of the skills, knowledge and experience of Board members against the current and future requirements of the Company and of the benefits of diversity. The Company recognizes the importance of diversity at all levels of the Company as well as on the Board and considers overall Board balance and diversity when appointing new directors. Board appointments are, in the final analysis, made on merit.
The Company employs multiple strategies in identifying director nominees, including the obtaining of recommendations from security holders, recommendations from current directors, and from the Company's corporate advisors. The Company also utilizes professional recruitment firms, as may be required, in seeking qualified director nominees. The qualifications of director nominees are evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to determine if the director nominees have the requisite technical and commercial expertise to maintain a proper balance of skills required by the Board. There are no differences in the evaluation of director nominees recommended by security holders. Director nominees are interviewed in depth by the Committee and the Board to further qualify the director nominees and evaluate the personal integrity and character of the candidate.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
The Board does not have a policy on whether the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the Chairman of the Board should be selected from among the independent directors. Our Board believes that it should have the flexibility to make these determinations at any given time in the way that it believes best to provide appropriate leadership for the Company at that time. Our Board has reviewed our current Board leadership structure in light of the composition of the Board, the Company's size, the nature of the Company's business, the regulatory framework under which the Company operates, and other relevant factors. Considering these factors, the Company has determined to have the same individual, Michael Palleschi, serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The Board does not have nor has it appointed a lead independent director.
The Board administers its risk oversight function directly and through the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee regularly discuss with management the Company's major risk exposures, their potential financial impact on the Company, and the steps taken to monitor and control those risks.
Director Independence
The Board has determined that Patrick O'Hare, Luisa Ingargiola, Christopher Ferguson and Brad Mitchell are independent as that term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE American. In making these determinations, our Board has concluded that none of our independent directors has an employment, business, family or other relationship which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Michael Palleschi is not considered independent because of his role as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Fred Sacramone is not considered independent because of his role as President of Benchmark Builders, Inc., our wholly owned-subsidiary. We expect our independent directors to meet in executive session (without the participation of executive officers or other non-independent directors) at least two times each year, and the independent directors may appoint an independent director to preside over each such meeting of independent directors.
Board Meetings
The Board held two meetings (including regularly scheduled and special) during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Each incumbent director attended greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which each director has been a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which each director served (during the period for which each director has been a director).
The Board encourages all of its members to attend its Board meetings.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent (10%) of a registered class of a company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater than ten percent (10%) stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, we believe that all reports under Section 16(a) required to be filed by our officers and directors and greater than ten percent (10%) beneficial owners were timely filed.
Code of Ethics 
Effective January 5, 2015, the Board adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with the purpose of assuring that all employees and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries understand and adhere to high ethical standards of conduct. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company website at www.ftenet.com. We have also adopted an Insider Trading Policy that applies to all directors, officers, and employees.
Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Our directors and executive officers are indemnified as provided by the Nevada law and our Bylaws. These provisions state that our directors may cause us to indemnify a director or former director against all costs, charges and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, and reasonably incurred by him/her as a result of him acting as a director. The indemnification of costs can include an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment. Such indemnification is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission's policy regarding indemnification.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise. We have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

The following discussion relates to types of transactions involving our company and any of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or five percent (5%) stockholders, each of whom we refer to as a "related party." For purposes of this discussion, a "related-party transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship:
โ in which we participate;
โ that involves an amount in excess of the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years; and
โ in which a related party has a direct or indirect material interest.
From January 1, 2017 through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no related-party transactions, except for the executive officer and director compensation arrangements described in the section "Executive Compensation" and as described below.
Guarantees/Related Party Advances
The CEO provided cash advances witnessed by interest-bearing notes totaling $0 and $536,000, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and provided cash advances totaling approximately $0 and $80,000, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, the CEO provided a personal credit card account for the purchase of goods and services by FTE. While the credit card balances are reflected in the Company's books and records, the CEO is personally liable for the payment of the entire amount of the open credit obligation, which was approximately $0 and $12,000 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Additionally, we entered into several secured equipment financing arrangements with total obligations of approximately $47,000 and $345,000 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, that required the guaranty of a company officer, which was provided by him.
The CFO provided an unsecured, interest-bearing note totaling $150 during the year ended December 31, 2017. The balance on the note was approximately $0 and $80,000 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, the CFO personally guaranteed several secured equipment financing arrangements with total obligations of approximately $69,000 and $562,000 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The CFO also provides a personal credit card account for the purchase of goods and services by FTE. While the credit card balances are reflected in our books and records, the CFO is personally liable for the payment of the entire amount of the open credit obligation, which was approximately $0 and $14,000 at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Mr. Chris Ferguson, a member of the Board of Directors, has provided cash advances totaling approximately $147,000 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Benchmark Notes

APPENDIX A
Proposed Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
Article IV of the articles of incorporation is amended by deleting the provisions of that article and substituting the following provision:
IV. Directors. Directors shall hold office from the close of the annual meeting for a term of three years, or until their successors have been elected and qualified or appointed. Provided that at least one-fourth in number of the directors of the Corporation must be elected annually, directors shall be classified with respect to the time for which they shall hold office by dividing them into three classes, each class to consist of as nearly as possible, an equal number of directors. With respect to the first election of directors following this amendment to the articles, the directors of the first class shall hold office for an initial term of one year, the directors of the second class for an initial term of two years, and the directors of the third class for an initial term of three years. The composition of the three classes shall be determined by the directors prior to the first election of directors under this amendment. At the close of each annual meeting of the Corporation, the successors to the class of directors whose terms expire that year shall commence to hold office for a term of three years, or until their successors have been elected and qualified or until earlier resignation or removal. In the event of an increase in the number of directors, the remaining directors shall assign the newly created positions to the appropriate class or classes so that the three classes shall continue to consist of, as nearly as possible, an equal number of directors.
