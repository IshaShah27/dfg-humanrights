       Dear Stockholders   I am pleased to invite you to attend Allegheny Technologies Incorporated's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is also my first Annual Meeting as ATI's  President and Chief Executive Officer.   For ATI, 2018 was a strong year. Our revenues surpassed  $4 billion for the first time since 2014, as we capitalized on meaningful growth across nearly all of our key end markets. This success rests on the foundation of a number of important objectives achieved during the year, as well as  the strategies developed over the last several years, on which we will continue to execute in 2019 and beyond.   Throughout 2018, our High Performance Materials and Components segment benefitted from strong demand across its customer base, most notably from the accelerating  transition to next-generation commercial jet engines and aircraft. We are intently focused on flawlessly executing our role in the current aerospace demand ramp. This commitment is critical to us, our customers and our shareholders. To that end, we  are making targeted investments in our HPMC business to ensure our ongoing ability to meet growing customer demand. At the same time, we look to the future, further investing in our powder and additive manufacturing capabilities and exploring future  investment in other specialty materials.

Our Flat Rolled Products business continued to make important strides in 2018 toward sustainable profitability. Segment operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, demonstrating the value of our product mix improvements and actions to transform that business into a technology and efficiency focused supplier of advanced materials. Notably, 2018 saw significant new business wins resulting from the unique capabilities of our Hot Rolling and Processing Facility, and we are seeing success in our efforts to optimize its utilization. In 2018, we announced our first significant HRPF carbon steel tolling agreement, which is already benefitting our business. Recently, we announced that Kimberly Fields will succeed me in leading the FRP business, and we look forward to her future contributions. 
Importantly, while we often speak in terms of the separate components of ATI's business, our HPMC and FRP businesses are becoming increasingly synergistic as we transform to a fully aligned and integrated provider of high-value, differentiated products. In addition to our ability to share technology, know-how and services, providing a full suite of nickel and titanium alloys enhances ATI's ability to win long-term agreements with key customers. In fact, among ATI's top ten customers, half buy products from both the FRP and HPMC segments, representing more than 20% of ATI's total revenue. We believe these synergies have the potential to catalyze our future growth on multiple fronts. 
Our recent strategic decisions and targeted investments are enabling us to forge and grow strong relationships with customers who rely on our innovative technologies and products – customers who cannot do what they do without us. We continually explore ways to grow our differentiated capabilities to gain entry into adjacent markets that value materials science, and we are accelerating our relentless pursuit of improvements in productivity through simplifying, standardizing and digitizing our operations. Our goal is to be the globally recognized leader in advanced materials and components and to consistently create and enhance long-term shareholder value. 
In all that we do, we are committed to our core values. We believe that what resonates most with investors is the same thing our customers and employees value: we do what we say we're going to do, when we say we're going to do it, and we do it the right way. As highlighted in this Proxy Statement, our corporate governance practices, investor outreach efforts and compensation programs reflect these values. 
It is my great privilege to take the ATI helm from Rich Harshman. I thank him, our Board and leadership team for developing the strategies upon which we are already delivering and which will carry us forward into the future. I value feedback from our investors and look forward to our ongoing dialogue. Thank you for your support in our continued commitment to Creating Long-Term Value Thru Relentless Innovation®. 
Sincerely, 
Robert S. Wetherbee 
President and Chief Executive Officer

Our goal is to be responsive to our stockholders and to ensure that we understand and address their concerns and observations. As a result of our stockholder engagement, we have made significant changes to our corporate governance practices and executive compensation program since 2015.

Our Compensation Philosophy—Pay for Performance 
ATI's executive compensation program is designed to support our long-term strategic vision and to align with our pay-for-performance philosophy. The goals of our program are to compensate executive management based on our performance, create long-term stockholder value and attract and retain key employees. Paying for performance is a key attribute of ATI's compensation philosophy. As such, a significant portion of the compensation of each named executive officer ("NEO") is subject to the achievement of rigorous performance goals and, therefore, is "at risk."

[END TABLE]
Total Realized Compensation 
When making determinations and awards under our incentive plans, the Personnel and Compensation Committee looks to the actual dollar value of awards to be delivered to the NEOs in any given year, as illustrated by the Total Realized Compensation figures below. Total realized compensation has been meaningfully lower than target for each of our NEOs in recent past years. For example, for 2017, Messrs. Harshman, Wetherbee, DeCourcy, Kramer and Sims received total realized compensation equal to 58.9%, 70.8%, 73.5%, 71.4% and 73.4% of their 2017 target compensation levels, respectively, and for 2016, received 51.6%, 42.0%, 66.3%, 80.3% and 82.4% of target, respectively. In contrast, the below comparison of 2018 target compensation to realized compensation for our NEOs reflects our significantly improved year-over-year financial performance in 2018. These multi-year trends demonstrate our ongoing commitment to compensating our leadership based on the Company's performance and placing a significant portion of senior executive compensation "at risk."

CEO Leadership Transition and 2019 Retention Awards 
In view of our recent CEO leadership transition, our Personnel and Compensation Committee increased the size of the 2019 equity awards granted to certain key executives, including each of Messrs. DeCourcy, Kramer and Sims, on a one-time basis.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result, Mr. DeCourcy and Mr. Kramer each received a target award equal to 300% of his base salary and  Mr. Sims received a target award equal to 350% of his base salary. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consistent with our Long-term Incentive Program, these larger 2019 awards are comprised 70% of performance-vested restricted  stock units, the payment of which is contingent on the achievement of quantitative performance measures over a three-year performance measurement period, and 30% of time-vested restricted stock units that vest in three equal annual increments and  are otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions of the Long-Term Incentive Program.  
[END TABLE]
Our Personnel and Compensation Committee intends these awards to reflect ATI's interest in establishing continued engagement, motivation and retention within the core leadership group throughout our CEO transition process and beyond.

Item 1: Election Of Directors
Our Board of Directors has nominated three directors for election. Leroy M. Ball, Jr., Carolyn Corvi and Robert S. Wetherbee are standing for election to the Board as Class II directors for three-year terms expiring in 2022. Three of the Directors currently serving as Class II directors, including Richard J. Harshman, who has been a member of our Board since 2011 and who retired from his role as our President and Chief Executive Officer at the end of 2018, John D. Turner, who has been a member of our Board since 2004, and Barbara S. Jeremiah, who has been a member of our Board since 2008, will retire from the Board at the conclusion of their respective current terms in conjunction with the 2019 Annual Meeting and therefore will not stand for reelection. 
Plurality Voting: Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the three individuals nominated for election to the Board who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically, telephonically or by proxy) will be elected. 
Director Resignation Policy: While directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, our Bylaws include a director resignation policy. This policy states that, in an uncontested election, if any director nominee receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election, as compared to votes "FOR" such election, the director nominee must tender his or her resignation. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is required to make recommendations to the Board regarding any such tendered resignation. The Board will act on the tendered resignation within 90 days from the certification of the vote and will publicly disclose its decision, including its rationale. 
Only votes "FOR" or "WITHHELD" are counted in determining whether a plurality has been cast in favor of a director nominee; abstentions are not counted for purposes of the election of directors. If you withhold authority to vote with respect to the election of some or all of the nominees, your shares will not be voted with respect to those nominees indicated. For a "WITHHOLD" vote, your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and will have a similar effect as a vote against that director nominee for purposes of our director resignation policy. 
If a nominee becomes unable or unwilling to serve, the proxies will vote for a Board-designated substitute or the Board may reduce the number of directors. The Company has no reason to believe that any of the nominees for election will be unable or unwilling to serve. 
Director Terms 
Our directors currently are divided into three classes, and the directors in each class generally serve for three-year terms unless unable to serve due to death, retirement or disability. The term of one class of directors currently expires each year at our annual meeting of stockholders. The Board may fill a vacancy by electing a new director to the same class as the director being replaced or by effectively reassigning a director from another class. The Board may also create a new director position in any class and elect a director to hold the newly created position.

The Board is responsible for recommending director nominees to the stockholders and for selecting directors to fill vacancies between stockholder meetings. The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends candidates to the Board. 
The Committee considers director candidates suggested by sitting directors, senior management and stockholders, among other sources. Additionally, the Board has engaged an external search firm to facilitate its ongoing, nation-wide candidate search as part of its current refreshment effort. The Committee believes that a wide-ranging and robust search is the best way to identify those candidates who most aptly meet the experience, skill and other criteria established by the Committee as necessary or desirable additions to the Board.

In evaluating the needs of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the qualifications and past contributions to the Board of sitting directors and consults with other members of the Board (including as part of the Board's annual self-evaluation), our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other members of executive management. At a minimum, all recommended candidates must exemplify the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, meet any required independence standards, and be willing and able to constructively participate in and contribute to Board and committee meetings. Currently, our Board is concertedly engaged in a refreshment effort that focuses on these and other more specific criteria, including ensuring that the Board continues to include key skills sets. For example, our Board recently appointed Leroy M. Ball, who possesses characteristics that the Board viewed as valuable additions to its overall composition (including his experience as a sitting CEO), and has been designated as a second "Audit Committee Financial Expert" under applicable SEC and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, in addition to John R. Pipski, who currently chairs our Audit Committee.

Corporate Governance Guidelines 
ATI's Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that are designed to assist the Board in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities to the Company. The Guidelines reflect the Board's commitment to monitor the effectiveness of decision making at the Board and management levels, with a view to achieving ATI's strategic objectives. The Guidelines are subject to modification by the Board at any time. 
Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics (our "Code of Ethics") apply to all directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, and our controller and principal accounting officer. We require all directors, officers and employees to adhere to our Code of Ethics in addressing legal and ethical issues encountered in their work. 
Our Code of Ethics requires that our directors, officers and employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with applicable laws, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner, and otherwise act with integrity and honesty in all of their actions by or on behalf of the Company. It includes a financial code of ethics specifically for our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and all other financial officers and employees, which supplements the general principles in the Code of Ethics and is intended to promote honest and ethical conduct, full and accurate reporting, and compliance with laws, as well as other matters. 
Only the Audit Committee of the Board can amend or grant waivers from the provisions of the Code of Ethics relating to the Company's executive officers and directors, and any such amendments or waivers will be promptly posted on our website at ATImetals.com. To date, no such amendments have been made or waivers granted. 
Mandatory Employee Training 
All employees are provided with a copy of the Code of Ethics. Each year, we require all officers and managers to certify as to their understanding of and compliance with the Code of Ethics. In addition, all directors, officers and other employees must annually complete an interactive online ethics course addressing the Code of Ethics. This course is part of ATI's broader ethics and compliance program, which includes online ethics training that is administered by a third party. In 2018, ATI's online ethics courses addressed the protection of confidential information, the prevention of workplace violence, careful communication practices, information security threat awareness, sexual harassment and respect in the workplace, supporting human rights and insider trading. 
We encourage employees to communicate concerns before they become problems. We believe that building and maintaining trust, respect and communication between employees and management and between fellow employees is critical to the overriding goal of efficiently producing high quality products, providing the maximum level of customer satisfaction, and ultimately fueling profitability and growth. 
The ATI Ethics Helpline provides confidential, secure, and anonymous reporting available 24 hours a day. Additionally, our Chief Compliance Officer and ethics officers at our operating companies also provide confidential resources for employees to surface their concerns without fear of reprisal.

Inaugural Sustainability Report 
In 2018, we published our first stand-alone Sustainability Report. With the recognition that "sustainability" can mean many things, the Report provides an overview of environmental, workforce health and safety and community sustainability efforts and achievements across our business. We also established specific environmental sustainability goals that ATI will pursue over the next 20+ years. We intend to publish our report and update our stakeholders on our progress toward these goals annually.

Investor Outreach and Stockholder Engagement 
We value the input we receive from our stockholders. As part of our investor relations program, we engage in a structured communication program with certain investors, actively engaging with them throughout the year. We solicit their feedback on a variety of relevant matters, which may include corporate governance topics, our executive compensation program and sustainability initiatives, among other matters. Our goal is to be responsive to our stockholders and to ensure that we understand and address their concerns and observations. As a result of stockholder engagement, we have made significant changes to our corporate governance practices and executive compensation program in recent years. 
Stockholder Engagement Cycle 
Throughout the year, management conducts regular meetings and discussions with investors. Each Fall, we offer our largest stockholders a more structured opportunity for one-on-one discussions with representatives of our management team. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we conducted outreach sessions with several of our largest investors, covering topics of discussion including, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• key current corporate governance policies and practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our ongoing CEO transition;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continuing Board refreshment efforts and our Board's focus on diversity of background, experience, skill and other  characteristics;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the mid-2018 publication of our inaugural stand-alone Sustainability Report;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• and the ongoing success of our redesigned executive compensation programs (as illustrated by the greater than 96% favorable  "say on pay" vote we achieved in 2018).  
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 outreach dialogue generally solicited very positive feedback from our investors, in particular with regard to the best practices reflected in our executive compensation programs. 
Additionally, in November 2018, we held a full Investor Day during which our leadership team met with more than 60 investors and other participants to provide an in-depth overview of our business. A webcast of the Investor Day presentation was made available on our investor relations website, offering a further opportunity for shareholder engagement.

Board Information 
Board Independence 
The Board does not consider Robert S. Wetherbee, President and Chief Executive Officer of ATI, to be independent. Additionally, the Board does not consider Richard J. Harshman, who currently serves as Executive Chairman pending his upcoming retirement in conjunction with the 2019 Annual Meeting, to be independent. At its February 28, 2019 meeting, the Board determined that the remaining eleven current directors (including each of our continuing directors, other than Mr. Wetherbee) are independent in accordance with NYSE listing standards, our own Board independence standards and the rules of the SEC. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board has the flexibility to determine whether it is in the best interests of ATI and its stockholders to separate or combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at any given time. Whenever a Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer is appointed, or at such other times as it deems appropriate, the Board assesses whether the roles should be separated or combined based upon its evaluation of, among other things, the existing composition of the Board and the circumstances at the time. 
From 2011 through 2018, Mr. Harshman served as both the Chairman of the Board and as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. During his tenure as such, the Board believed that, particularly in light of his long tenure with the Company, Mr. Harshman's service in both capacities promoted unified leadership and direction for the Company and allowed for a single, clear focus on the efficient implementation of ATI's strategies to maximize stockholder value over the long-term. In addition, the Board believed that Mr. Harshman, serving in both capacities, was an effective bridge between the Board and ATI's management. 
Furthermore, the Board's ability to maintain appropriate independent oversight of our business strategies and activities was enhanced by ATI's existing strong governance structures and policies, such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• establishing a Lead Independent Director position (transitioning to Independent Board Chair in May 2019);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appointing only independent directors to the standing committees of the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• regularly scheduling executive sessions of the independent directors.

Why the pending transition to separate Chairman and CEO roles is best for ATI and our stockholders at this time 
The Board considered the roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer in connection with the Company's recent CEO transition and determined that the Company and its stockholders would be best served by separation of the two roles. The Board believes that separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO will help optimize Mr. Wetherbee's ability to focus his attention and efforts exclusively on management matters and the day-to-day execution of the Company's strategy during this time of leadership transition. Further, the Board believes that Diane C. Creel's anticipated transition from Lead Independent Director, a role she has held since 2011, to Independent Board Chair in May 2019, will enhance its level of independent oversight.

Board and Committee Membership—Director Attendance at Meetings 
During 2018, the Board of Directors held 11 meetings, including a multi-day strategy meeting. In 2018, directors attended more than 98% of all Board meetings and meetings of Board committees of which they were members. 
The independent, non-management directors meet separately in regularly scheduled executive sessions without members of management (except to the extent that the non-management directors request the attendance of a member of management). The Lead Independent Director presides over meetings of the independent directors. 
A Board meeting is typically scheduled in conjunction with our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and it is expected that our directors will attend absent good reason. In 2018, all directors attended our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The table below provides information about the Board committee memberships that our independent directors currently hold. The table also shows the number of meetings held by each Board committee in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Board Chair may attend each Committee meeting, except to the extent that a Committee requests to meet without the  Chair present. Mr. Ball was appointed to our Board in February 2019 and therefore did not attend any meetings of the Board or any committee during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Ms. Creel currently serves as Lead Independent Director and presides over meetings of the independent directors. She  may attend meetings of committees of which she is not a member. Ms. Creel will become the Independent Board Chair immediately following the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Board Committees 
The Board has five standing committees: Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee, Personnel and Compensation Committee, and Technology Committee. All of the standing committees of the Board are comprised entirely of independent directors. 
Each committee has a written charter that describes its responsibilities. Each of the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Personnel and Compensation Committee has the authority, as it deems appropriate, to independently engage outside legal, accounting or other advisors or consultants. In addition, each committee annually conducts a review and evaluation of its performance and reviews and reassesses its charter.

Our Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board, as a whole, actively oversees the risk management of the Company. Enterprise risks—the specific financial, operational, business and strategic risks that the Company faces, whether internal or external—are identified and prioritized by the Board and management together, and then each specific risk is assigned to the full Board or a Board committee for oversight.

Board of Directors' Role and Compensation 
Non-employee directors receive compensation for their service that is designed to fairly compensate them for their Board responsibilities and align their interests with our stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews and evaluates our non-employee director compensation program to ensure that it is competitive with ATI's industry peers and best practices and serves the purposes of attracting and retaining high quality directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee uses an independent consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners LLC, which is the same consultant retained by the Personnel and Compensation Committee, to provide market and comparison data and information on current developments and practices in director compensation. ATI's non-employee director compensation program is competitive and market-based. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board encourages directors to obtain a meaningful stock ownership interest in ATI. Under the stock ownership guidelines applicable to all non-employee directors, each non-employee director is expected to own at least 10,000 shares of ATI Common Stock within five years of his or her initial election to the Board. Furthermore, directors are required to retain one-third of any awarded stock until compliance with the guidelines is achieved. Beginning in 2018, our Directors may opt to receive all or a portion of their cash retainer in shares of ATI stock. 
Each of the directors complied with the guidelines as of December 31, 2018 or is reasonably proceeding with compliance as of the applicable five-year anniversary of his or her initial election to the Board.

Related Party Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written Statement of Policy with respect to Related Party Transactions. The Policy applies to transactions or arrangements between ATI and a related person (namely directors, executive officers, and their immediate family members, and 5% stockholders) with a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction, including transactions requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
Under the Policy, no related party transaction may occur unless it is approved or ratified by the Audit Committee or approved by the disinterested members of the Board. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for approving and ratifying related party transactions, and in doing so, will consider all matters it deems appropriate, including the dollar value of the proposed transaction, the relative benefits to be obtained and obligations to be incurred by the Company, and whether the terms of the transaction are comparable to those available to third parties. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Personnel and Compensation Committee is an officer or employee of the Company. No member of the Committee has a current or prior relationship, and none of our executive officers have a relationship, to any other company that is required to be described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of executive compensation. 
Stock Ownership Information 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
The rules of the SEC require the Company to disclose late filings of reports of stock ownership (and changes in stock ownership) by its directors and executive officers and by persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities. Based upon a review of filings with the SEC and written representations, the Company believes that, in 2018, all such persons complied with the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on a timely basis.

ATI 2019 Proxy Statement    / 33 
Item 2 – Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers 
Each year we ask our stockholders to approve the compensation of ATI's named executive officers. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say On Pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
While this vote is advisory, and not binding on our Company, it provides valuable information to our Personnel and Compensation Committee regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices. The Committee will consider the outcome of this vote when determining executive compensation for the remainder of 2019 and in future years. 
In 2018, our Say On Pay proposal received the support of more than 96% of the shares voted at our Annual Meeting. We believe that ATI's 2018 executive compensation is similarly and appropriately aligned with stockholder interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Using Executive Compensation to  Create Long-Term Stockholder Value   The Committee continually reviews the  compensation program for our NEOs to ensure that it achieves the desired goal of offering total compensation consisting of base salary competitive with an identified peer group of companies and incentive opportunities that are performance-oriented  and linked to the interests of stockholders.   When casting your Say On Pay vote, we urge you  to consider:   Linking compensation to ATI performance     Approximately 84% of our CEOs 2018 compensation opportunity was tied to  performance and, therefore, at risk. Performance drives pay.     Our short-term cash incentive and long-term equity incentive plans are based  on the attainment of business plan performance metrics, such as operating profit, EBITDA, net income, cash flow, return on capital, strategic goals, and total stockholder return relative to a peer group.     Payments  with regard to the performance-vested components of both our annual and long-term incentive programs are made only when at least threshold performance targets are achieved.     As a result of the performance-driven design of our incentive compensation  programs and the challenges that our business has faced in recent years, our NEOs have forfeited much of their recent target compensation, particularly awards under our long-term incentive programs, with resulting realized compensation significantly  below target compensation.   Aligning compensation to stockholder interests     All of  the long-term incentive compensation opportunities for our NEOs are equity-based.     The business plan performance metrics that drive our performance-vested  compensation programs are metrics that we believe correlate with the achievement of sustained profitable growth.     Our stock ownership guidelines for senior executives denote ownership as a  multiple of base salary, prescribing 6X ownership for our CEO and 100% retention until ownership guidelines are met.

Pay For Performance 
Paying for performance is a key attribute of ATI's compensation philosophy. Fundamentally, ATI's executive compensation program links compensation to the achievement of specific, predetermined financial and performance goals that further ATI's business strategies. As such, a significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is subject to the achievement of rigorous performance goals and, therefore, is "at risk." The Company uses three-year performance measurement periods for all but our annual cash incentive plan in recognition of performance over a longer period of time and to mitigate compensation risk. In this way, our programs both reward actual performance and are effective in driving achievement of the Company's underlying near and longer-term goals.

• 2018 Short-Term Incentive payments were above target due to strong financial performance: Our executives received  short-term incentive payments under our annual incentive plan for 2018 that ranged from 135% to 179.6% of their respective target awards reflecting our strong performance and key achievements during 2018, including significant improvements in our  2018 financial performance compared to 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Multi-year trends reflect commitment to pay for performance: Our 2018 payment of short-term incentive awards at  greater-than-target levels follows near-target short-term incentive payments for 2017 and short-term incentive payments for 2016 and 2015 that were either zero or significantly below target. This trend reflects not only the many challenges facing  our business during the 2015-2016 timeframe, but also the demonstrable success of our restructuring efforts and growth initiatives and the strong correlation between pay and performance inherent in our executive compensation programs.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term Incentive results continue to reflect past challenges: Notably, as we sought to transform our business over  the last several years, the results of our long-term compensation programs also contributed to below-target annual compensation for our NEOs. Specifically, a substantial portion of the long-term incentive awards granted to our NEOs for the  performance periods ended in 2015, 2016 and 2017 did not vest, because the applicable performance criteria (including market performance as reflected in the total shareholder return component of certain awards) were not satisfied. As a consequence,  our NEOs' aggregate realized compensation in 2017 and for several years prior was meaningfully lower than the target total annual compensation established for each of them.

Our Compensation Philosophy 
Role of the Personnel and Compensation Committee 
The Committee's primary responsibility is to design compensation plans that support the Board's and management's long-term strategic vision for ATI and to ensure that those plans support ATI's goal of creating stockholder value over the long-term. Over the last several years, the Committee has emphasized design clarity and transparency to better communicate with our stockholders and to ensure that our compensation programs are aligned with evolving best practices. 
The Committee is composed of five independent, non-employee directors. The Committee has the sole responsibility to carry out ATI's overarching policy of linking its executive compensation program to the interests of its stockholders. The Committee is responsible for determining compensation for the NEOs and other members of the management Executive Council, which currently is comprised of five members of senior management, including the CEO. The Committee also has the responsibility for oversight of the Company's equity plans, variable compensation plans for management employees and supervising management's implementation of those plans to ensure a continuing source of leadership and succession planning for ATI. In addition, the Committee reviews compliance with independence standards applicable to ATI's compensation consultant. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultants 
The Committee, under its charter, has the sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant used in the evaluation of executive compensation and has the sole authority to approve the retention terms of the consultant, including fees. The compensation consultant retained by the Committee is responsible only to the Committee. The Committee reviews the qualifications of the consultant, including independence. The Committee re-evaluates the consultant's independence on an ongoing basis. The Committee may, at any time, contact the consultant without interaction from management. 
For 2018, the Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, a nationally recognized executive compensation consultant, for benchmarking compensation and program design and advice on a variety of compensation related matters. Meridian, which the Committee determined is independent, provides no other services to ATI. Further, because Meridian is involved only in the business of executive compensation consulting, Meridian does not attempt to sell other services to the Company. 
Our Philosophy 
The Committee's approach to compensation is to offer a base salary that is competitive with an identified benchmarking peer group of companies and incentive opportunities that are performance-oriented and linked to the interests of stockholders. The Committee has developed a balance of annual and long-term programs using diverse criteria to discourage inappropriate risk taking. For the NEOs, the program consists of base salary, an annual performance-based cash incentive, longer-term performance-based compensation opportunities and a time-based equity component that is intended to serve as a retention tool. 
The Committee views the executive compensation program as a management tool that, through a detailed and quantitative target-setting process, establishes challenging financial performance goals that encourage the management team to achieve or surpass ATI's business objectives.

      The Committee has determined that the  executive compensation program should:        
      The Committee has determined that the  executive compensation program should:        
       pay competitively by setting overall target  compensation, which is realized when performance targets are met, in line with target compensation at peer companies and other companies and industries with which ATI competes for executive talent;      provide  performance-oriented incentive pay opportunities that are linked to the interests of stockholders by putting substantial portions of potential compensation at risk;      support ATIs business strategy by tying performance goals to  specific Company annual and longer-term strategic objectives; and      retain executives who are essential to driving ATIs strategies and  future growth.

Competitive Compensation 
The Committee reviews, with outside compensation and other advisors, the compensation policies and practices at peer companies that ATI competes with for talent and skill sets in the Company's multiple locations, or that are in our industry and serving our end markets. We use this information to help establish base compensation levels throughout the management organization at the approximate median of these groups. The incentive plans provide opportunities to earn additional amounts if performance goals are met or exceeded, but do not pay out if performance goals are not met. 
Performance-Oriented and Linked to the Interests of Stockholders 
The Committee believes that the more senior the manager, the larger the percentage of compensation that, over time, should be at risk. The goals and targets used across all management levels include both company-wide financial performance measures as well as pre-set goals within a particular participant's area of responsibility. They are designed to encourage a team-oriented approach to achieving ATI profitability and strategic objectives and positioning the Company for the future challenges. The Committee scales compensation challenges and opportunities by level of responsibility and focuses performance on the measures that particular managers can most directly influence. 
The Committee implements its pay-for-performance philosophy by using performance metrics that are linked to the interests of stockholders, such as operating profit, EBITDA, net income/earnings, total stockholder return, and/or strategic goals that are designed to help create stockholder value over the long-term. In 2018, performance goals focused on income, EBITDA, cash flow, and ROIC (return on invested capital). ATI's business plans have focused on internal generation of the funds necessary for sustainable, profitable growth and both product and end market diversification. 
Attract and Retain Talent 
We designed our program to attract and retain a deep pool of managerial talent who share ATI's commitment to enhancing stockholder value in the short- and longer-terms. The Committee believes that the plans and performance goals will attract, challenge, and retain superior managers experienced in ATI's businesses and direct their efforts toward achieving specific tasks that the Board and senior management determine to be necessary for profitable growth through business cycles. 
CEO Leadership Transition and 2019 Retention Awards 
In view of our recent CEO leadership transition, our Personnel and Compensation Committee increased the size of the 2019 equity awards granted to certain key executives, including each of Messrs. DeCourcy, Kramer and Sims, on a one-time basis.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result, Mr. DeCourcy and Mr. Kramer each received a target award equal to 300% of his base salary and  Mr. Sims received a target award equal to 350% of his base salary. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consistent with our Long-term Incentive Program, these larger 2019 awards are comprised 70% of PSUs, the payment of which is  contingent on the achievement of quantitative performance measures over a three-year performance measurement period, and 30% of RSUs that vest in three equal annual increments and are otherwise subject to the other terms and conditions of the  Long-Term Incentive Program.  
[END TABLE]
Our Personnel and Compensation Committee intends these awards to reflect ATI's interest in establishing continued engagement, motivation and retention within the core leadership group throughout our CEO transition process and beyond.

Near the end of each year, the Board (including members of the Committee) reviews ATI's annual and long-term business and strategic plans with management. During the first quarter of the following year, the Committee reviews the Company's year-end financial results and, based on its assessment of ATI's achievement of the predefined financial goals and objectives, determines the extent to which awards with performance measurement periods that concluded at the end of the previous year are payable. 
During the first quarter of each fiscal year, the Committee authorizes compensation programs for the year and establishes specific financial performance goals for the performance period or periods applicable to awards under such programs in light of the Board approved business and strategic plans. 
The Committee considers which incentive plans, award levels and performance goals would optimize the achievement of ATI's future business objectives without introducing systemic risk driven by the executive compensation program. The Committee solicits the views of its advisors as to whether the plans under consideration reflect and support achievement of the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives and strategies. The Committee also approves individual participation levels in the compensation plans for the CEO and members of the management Executive Council and directs executive management to establish participation levels in the plans for other eligible employees within the guidelines given by the Committee. Generally, all prospective compensation opportunities under the long-term compensation plans are made at the Committee's February meeting. 
Internal Pay Equity 
Using market data, our independent compensation consultant advises the Committee on relative compensation among the Executive Council members, including the NEOs. In recognition of his ultimate management responsibility as Chairman, President and CEO, base pay and compensation opportunities are significantly greater for the CEO than for the other NEOs. As a result, the Committee considers the ratios of CEO compensation opportunities and the compensation opportunities of each of the other NEOs in setting compensation opportunities. The ratio of the 2018 total realized compensation for Mr. Harshman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, compared to the average of the compensation of the other NEOs, as reflected in the Total Realized Compensation Table, is approximately 3.45:1. 
Benchmarking Peer Group 
The Committee considers, with information provided by the compensation consultant, compensation practices across a peer group of manufacturing companies. The Committee uses the peer group as a reference in developing its executive compensation program and in determining the competitiveness of its executive compensation levels. The Committee also uses information regarding compensation practices across a broader survey of manufacturing companies as a check against the peer group information. Annually, the Committee reviews the composition of its peer group to ensure that the companies constituting the peer group remain relevant and provide meaningful comparisons for compensation and business purposes. ATI believes that there are no other public companies that engage in the full range of the Company's specialty materials and components manufacturing, fabrication, marketing and distribution. Therefore, the Committee's independent compensation consultant developed the following criteria to guide the selection of peer companies for benchmarking compensation. Specifically, peer companies should: 1) be competitors for business and/or executive talent and be primarily from the metals industry or adjacent sectors; 2) have stock prices reasonably correlated with ATI over the past five years indicating sensitivity to similar external market influences and 3) be reflective of the general complexity and business orientation of ATI, including with respect to global footprint, product lines and foreign competition. Generally, the peers selected have: 
• Revenues that approximate 50% to 200% of ATI's with some flexibility; 
• Capital intensive businesses as indicated by lower asset turnover ratios (i.e., 0.5 to 1.5); 
• Higher stock price volatility, or "beta" (i.e., greater than 1.0); 
• Market capitalization reasonably aligned with ATI; Some flexibility for outliers that may be aligned from different perspectives (i.e., revenues, competition); and 
• Similar number of employees.

• Our incentive programs are heavily weighted toward performance-contingent awards, particularly for NEOs. Short-term  incentive awards to our NEOs for 2018 were 90% contingent on total ATI and (as applicable) segment financial performance and 70% of each 2018 long-term incentive award is performance-vested.

• Long-term incentive awards continued to reflect the substantial reduction in target awards (compared with prior years)  implemented in 2016 in connection with the redesign of our overall executive compensation program. Our CEO's target long-term award opportunity was 320% of base salary for 2016 and 350% of base salary for 2017 and 2018, compared to 400% for  2015. Target opportunities for our other NEOs remained unchanged compared to 2017 and reflect 2016 target reductions that ranged from 20%-33%. Additionally, since 2016, our awards have been weighted to more  heavily emphasize performance-vested shares compared to prior year awards. Specifically, for 2018:

2018 Annual Performance Plan ("APP") 
Adopted in connection with our 2016 clean-sheet redesign effort, the APP is a short-term cash incentive plan in which approximately 400 key employees (including the NEOs) participate. For Executive Council members, 90% of the performance goals are based on financial metrics, and 10% on strategic/individual goals, as described below. 
Financial Metrics For Corporate participants (including our CEO): 
Financial Metrics For Business Segment NEOs: 
Performance Criteria. The performance goals for the 2018 APP were set in February 2018 based on ATI's business and operations plans for 2018. Corporate-wide goals are established in a bottom-up process through which each business unit's business plan and business conditions are separately reviewed in setting targets, as are the expectations for other performance factors at each business unit. The performance goals include a mix of financial targets and strategic and/or individual performance goals. 
Level of Difficulty. The Committee sets the APP metrics so that the relative difficulty of achieving the target level is consistent from year to year. The objective is to establish target goals in any given year that are challenging yet achievable, with a much higher level of difficulty to achieve performance that generates the maximum payout.

Award Opportunities. The opportunities for the NEOs under the APP are granted at "threshold," "target" and "maximum" levels expressed as a percentage of base salary and based on predetermined levels of performance. The Committee sets the potential award ranges as percentages of base salary (the "annual incentive percentage") for each NEO using comparative market data provided by the compensation consultant. In general, our short-term incentive program is designed so that the payout associated with achieving threshold performance is equal to 50% of target while the payout associated with achieving the maximum performance level is capped at 200% of target. No payout with respect to the financial performance component is earned for performance below the threshold level.

Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") 
For our NEOs, 70% of the aggregate award under the long-term incentive portion of our redesigned compensation program, the Long-Term Incentive Plan, or "LTIP," is performance-based and entirely contingent on the achievement of quantitative performance measures, while the remaining 30% of the LTIP award is time-based to provide retention incentives. Specifically, the LTIP consists of two components, including performance stock units ("PSUs") that cliff vest based on the achievement of quantitative financial performance metrics over a three-year performance period and restricted stock units ("RSUs") that vest in three equal annual installments, provided that the recipient remains employed by ATI on the applicable vesting date.

Performance Stock Units: 
PSUs will vest to the extent that cumulative earnings (defined as income from continuing operations attributable to ATI) and ROIC (defined as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital) meet or exceed a Threshold, Target or Maximum level of performance set by the Committee at the beginning of the three-year performance measurement period. ROIC performance is averaged over the three-year performance measurement period. Whether the income or ROIC performance goals are met, and the extent to which the PSUs comprising a particular award vest, will be determined by the Personnel and Compensation Committee at the end of each three-year performance measurement period. When vested, each PSU will convert into a share of the Company's common stock. No dividends are accumulated or paid on the PSUs. 
Total Shareholder Return Adjustment. If the Committee determines that the income and ROIC goals for the 2018-2020 performance measurement period meet or exceed Threshold, the number of shares earned by NEOs may be increased or decreased by up to an additional 20% based on the Company's TSR relative to the TSR of a peer group of companies, as follows: 
For 2018 awards, we used a peer group modeled after the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) as our TSR peer group. 
Restricted Stock Units: 
RSUs granted under the LTIP vest in equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of their grant date, as long as the award recipient remains an employee of the Company on the relevant vesting date. If and when vested, each RSU converts into a share of Company common stock. No dividends accumulate or are paid on the RSUs. 
Legacy Awards 
In 2014 and 2015, the Company issued equity awards under certain legacy long-term equity incentive plans, including the Performance/ Restricted Stock Program ("PRSP") and another separate long-term incentive plan, both of which were discontinued beginning in 2016, when they were replaced with our existing long-term incentive programs, with no new awards are being made under either plan. However, because the terms of awards under the PRSP included multi-year performance and/or vesting schedules, legacy PRSP awards continued to impact the compensation realized by our NEOs in 2018 and likewise are expected to affect annual realized compensation for one or more of our NEOs through 2020. 
Under the PRSP, shares of performance-vested restricted stock were awarded to participants at the beginning of a three-year performance measurement period. Under the terms of the award, one-half of the stock-based award would vest, if at all, only upon ATI's achievement of predetermined performance criteria for the applicable three-year performance period, while the remaining half of the award would upon the earlier of (i) five years from the date of grant, if the participant remained employed by the Company on that date (or if the participant had retired, died or become disabled), or (ii) the last day of the applicable three-year performance period, if the performance criteria were attained during the performance period. 
As noted in the Company's proxy statements for its 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, one-half of each of the 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 awards were forfeited based on the Company's financial performance during the applicable performance period. The remaining half of the 2014 award vested in February 2019, and the remaining half of the awards granted in 2015, the last year for which awards were made under the PRSP program, will vest in early 2020, in each case for NEOs who received such awards and remain employed by ATI at that time or have retired, died or become disabled.

Other Compensation Policies 
Employment Agreements; Change in Control Agreements. 
ATI does not have any employment agreements with its NEOs. 
The Company has change in control agreements with each NEO and certain other executives that provide for severance payments to each such executive in the event he or she is terminated from his or her position in connection with a change in control, as defined in and provided by the agreements. These change in control agreements do not include an excise tax gross-up provision. The change in control agreements are intended to better enable ATI to retain the NEOs in the event that it is the subject of a potential change in control transaction. Based on past advice from its compensation consultant, the Committee believes that the potential payments under these agreements are, individually and in the aggregate, in line with competitive practices. 
For a more detailed discussion of these agreements, see the "Employment and Change in Control Agreements" section of this Proxy Statement. 
Adherence to Ethical Standards; Clawback Policy 
Incentive awards (paid in cash or equity) are conditioned on adherence to the Company's Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics, which are published on our website ATImetals.com. We have clawback agreements with each member of the management Executive Council, including the NEOs, that provide for the return of compensation to the extent that information used to calculate achievement of earnings or other performance measures is subsequently determined to be materially incorrect (including but not limited to circumstances under which any such inaccuracy results in a financial restatement). 
Pension and Retirement Plans 
ATI maintains qualified defined benefit pension plans, which have a number of benefit formulas that apply separately to various groups of employees and retirees. Effective December 31, 2014, the Company froze future benefit accruals in the ATI Pension Plan for all participating employees other than those in collectively bargained employment arrangements. Also, effective December 31, 2014, the Company froze the defined benefit-type non-qualified deferred compensation plans in which salaried employees participate, which includes the Supplemental Pension Plan in which Mr. Harshman participates and the defined benefit portion of the ATI Benefit Restoration Plan in which Messrs. Harshman, DeCourcy, Sims and Wetherbee participate. The Company continues to sponsor a qualified defined contribution plan and a non-qualified defined contribution restoration plan aimed at restoring the effects of limitations on defined contribution accruals imposed by the Code. For more information regarding the pension plans of the NEOs, see the Pension Benefits table and accompanying narrative. 
Perquisites 
ATI does not generally provide our executives with perquisites, such as the personal use of corporate aircraft without reimbursement to the Company, payment of club membership dues or tax reimbursement arrangements. ATI does provide a parking benefit to the NEOs who work at corporate headquarters on the same terms as provided to a broader group of corporate employees. 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation Expense. 
In evaluating compensation program alternatives, the Committee considers, among other factors, the potential impact on the Company of Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which generally places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation paid to certain executive officers that a company can deduct in any one year. At the time that the Committee made some of the compensation decisions that impacted the 2018 realized compensation paid to our NEOs, and prior to 2018 changes to Section 162(m), compensation that was performance-based and provided under a stockholder-approved plan generally was exempt from the calculation of the $1 million deduction limit and was therefore deductible. Consequently, certain pre-2018 incentive opportunities established by the Committee for our executive officers were designed in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 162(m)'s deduction limitation, because they are paid based on achievement of pre-determined performance goals established by the Committee pursuant to our stockholder-approved equity incentive plan.

       COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS | OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES       
[END TABLE]
The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation was repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, despite the Committee's efforts to structure annual cash incentives and PSUs in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) and therefore deductible, no assurance can be given that performance-based compensation that was intended to be deductible will in fact be deductible for federal tax purposes because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the future application and interpretation of Section 162(m), including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s exemption of performance based compensation from the deduction limit. 
While the Committee considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible by the Company for tax purposes. ATI's pay-for-performance philosophy is a key tenant of our executive compensation programs, and performance-based compensation is therefore likely to remain a central component of our overall executive compensation structure, irrespective of the extent to which such compensation may continue to be deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
No Hedging or Pledging of Stock 
ATI policy prohibits directors, officers and key employees from engaging in publicly traded options and hedging transactions with regard to ATI securities. ATI policies also prohibits our officers and directors from pledging ATI stock to secure personal loans. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Company maintains the following robust stock ownership guidelines for its executives, including the NEOs. These guidelines are designed to further link these executives' interests with the interests of stockholders generally: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer      6X Base Salary   
 Executive Vice Presidents and Chief Financial Officer      3X Base Salary   
 Senior Vice Presidents      2X Base Salary   
[END TABLE]
Executives are required to retain 100% of the after-tax value of shares issued upon the vesting of equity awards until the ownership requirement is satisfied. 
We adopted our current guidelines in 2016, transitioning from using a fixed number of shares as the method of determining ownership to targeting a multiple of base salary, which we believe requires a meaningful level of ownership for all NEOs, even during the cyclicality in our markets and declining stock prices. 
Each executive subject to the guidelines has until the later of February 25, 2021 or five years from the date of his or her promotion to one of the designated positions, as the case may be, to meet the guideline applicable to his/ her position. Accordingly, our CEO and each other NEO currently meets his ownership obligations under the guidelines.

Total Realized Compensation 
When making determinations and awards under our incentive plans, the Committee looks to the actual dollar value of awards to be delivered to the NEOs in any given year, as illustrated by the Total Realized Compensation figures below. Total realized compensation has been meaningfully lower than target for each of our NEOs for the last several years. For example, for 2017, Messrs. Harshman, Wetherbee, DeCourcy, Kramer and Sims received total realized compensation equal to 58.9%, 70.8%, 73.5%, 71.4% and 73.4% of their 2017 target compensation levels, respectively, and for 2016, received 51.6%, 42.0%, 66.3%, 80.3% and 82.4% of target, respectively. In contrast, the below comparison of 2018 target compensation to realized compensation for our NEOs reflects our significantly improved year-over-year financial performance in 2018. These multi-year trends demonstrate our ongoing commitment to compensating our leadership based on the Company's performance and placing a significant proportion of senior executive compensation "at risk":

 ATI Pension Plan   Qualified defined benefit plan   The Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Pension Plan (ATI Pension Plan) is the result  of the mergers of several plans previously sponsored by:     Allegheny Ludlum Corporation (Allegheny Ludlum),     Teledyne  Inc. (TDY)   Effective December 31, 2014, the Company froze future benefit  accruals under the ATI Pension Plan for all participating employees other than those with contractual employment arrangements.    ATI Pension Plan has a number of benefit formulas that apply separately to various groups of employees and  retirees, generally, by work location and job classification. A principal determinant of which formula applied prior to December 31, 2014 is whether the employee was employed by TDY, as in the case of Messrs. Harshman and Sims, at the time the  respective companies became members of the controlled group that includes the Company. Mr. DeCourcy s pension benefit formula includes periods of service with both Allegheny Ludlum and TDY.   Allegheny Ludlum ceased pension accruals under its pension formula in 1988, except for employees  who then met certain age and service criteria.   Each formula for Allegheny Ludlum and TDY  multiplies years of service by compensation and then by a factor to produce a benefit amount payable as a straight life annuity. That benefit amount is reduced with respect to Social Security amounts payable to determine the annuity amount payable.  Participants can choose alternate benefit forms, including survivor benefits. The Allegheny Ludlum and TDY definitions of service and compensation differ somewhat, as do the factors used in the respective formulas. However, the differences in the  resulting benefits between the two formulas are small for the NEOs to which they apply.   Upon  becoming a corporate employee in 1998, Mr. Harshman ceased receiving credit for service under the TDY formula after having been credited with approximately twenty-one years of service under that  formula.   Normal retirement age under the ATI Pension Plan is age 65. Participants can retire  with immediate commencement of an undiscounted accrued benefit at the normal retirement age or after thirty years of service regardless of age for Allegheny Ludlum and TDY participants.   Participants can retire prior to attaining age 65 or thirty years of service with benefit payments  discounted for early payment at age 62 with at least ten years of service or, with a greater discount, at age 55 with at least ten years of service.

However, the differences in the  resulting benefits between the two formulas are small for the NEOs to which they apply.   Upon  becoming a corporate employee in 1998, Mr. Harshman ceased receiving credit for service under the TDY formula after having been credited with approximately twenty-one years of service under that  formula.   Normal retirement age under the ATI Pension Plan is age 65. Participants can retire  with immediate commencement of an undiscounted accrued benefit at the normal retirement age or after thirty years of service regardless of age for Allegheny Ludlum and TDY participants.   Participants can retire prior to attaining age 65 or thirty years of service with benefit payments  discounted for early payment at age 62 with at least ten years of service or, with a greater discount, at age 55 with at least ten years of service.   
 ATI Pension Plan   Qualified defined benefit plan   The Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Pension Plan (ATI Pension Plan) is the result  of the mergers of several plans previously sponsored by:     Allegheny Ludlum Corporation (Allegheny Ludlum),     Teledyne  Inc. (TDY)   Effective December 31, 2014, the Company froze future benefit  accruals under the ATI Pension Plan for all participating employees other than those with contractual employment arrangements.    ATI Pension Plan has a number of benefit formulas that apply separately to various groups of employees and  retirees, generally, by work location and job classification. A principal determinant of which formula applied prior to December 31, 2014 is whether the employee was employed by TDY, as in the case of Messrs. Harshman and Sims, at the time the  respective companies became members of the controlled group that includes the Company. Mr. DeCourcy s pension benefit formula includes periods of service with both Allegheny Ludlum and TDY.   Allegheny Ludlum ceased pension accruals under its pension formula in 1988, except for employees  who then met certain age and service criteria.   Each formula for Allegheny Ludlum and TDY  multiplies years of service by compensation and then by a factor to produce a benefit amount payable as a straight life annuity. That benefit amount is reduced with respect to Social Security amounts payable to determine the annuity amount payable.  Participants can choose alternate benefit forms, including survivor benefits.

• Determination of Adjusted Employee Population. As of October 1, 2017, we had a total of 8,459 U.S. and non-U.S. employees. In establishing the population from which to identify our median employee, we excluded 293 employees who were on either leave or suspended status, as well as employees located in a number of  foreign jurisdictions under the 5% de minimis exception provided under Item 402(u), including 263 employees in the United Kingdom, 46 in Germany, 15 in France, seven in Japan, six in Korea, five in India, three in Singapore, three in Taiwan,  two in Dubai, and one each in Israel, Italy, Norway and Spain. Our remaining employee population as of October 1, 2017 consisted of approximately 7,812 employees working either full time or part time in the United States, Poland or China  at our parent company and consolidated subsidiaries, including our majority-owned joint venture, STAL.

• Identification of Median Employee. We compared the cash compensation, including wages, overtime, salary and bonuses,  paid during our fiscal year 2017 for each employee who was included in our adjusted employee population as the consistently applied compensation measure used to identify the median employee among those included in the adjusted employee population.  As part of this analysis, we converted the compensation paid to non-U.S. employees from local currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2017 and annualized the compensation  of each full-time or part-time employee who was hired in 2017 and included the adjusted employee population.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Calculation of Annual Total Compensation. In accordance with the SEC rules, we determined the median employee's  2018 annual total compensation to be $91,979, which is the amount that would have been reported for our median employee in the "Total" column (column (j)) of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included on page 57 of this Proxy  Statement if he had been a Named Executive Officer for fiscal 2018. In accordance with the SEC rules, we determined the CEO's 2018 annual total compensation to be $8,379,253 which is the amount reported for Mr. Harshman, who served as our  CEO throughout 2018, in the "Total" column (column (j)) of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included on page 57 of this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
We believe the methodology, assumptions and estimates described above to be reasonable given our employee population. The SEC rules grant companies significantly flexibility in determining the methodology, assumptions and estimates used to comply with the requirements of this disclosure. As acknowledged by the SEC, this flexibility could reduce the comparability of disclosed pay ratios across companies. Therefore, our pay ratio may not necessarily be representative of or comparable to pay ratios disclosed by other companies in the industry or otherwise.

The agreements have a term of three years, which three-year term will continue to be extended until either party gives written notice that it no longer wants to continue to extend the term. If a change in control occurs during the term, the agreements will remain in effect for the longer of three years or until all obligations of the Company under the agreements have been fulfilled. 
The Personnel and Compensation Committee has reviewed the change in control valuation, as well as the purposes and effects of the agreements, and determined that it is in the Company's best interests to retain the change in control agreements on their terms and conditions. 
Potential Payments upon Termination 
The tables below reflect estimates of the amount of compensation in addition to the amounts shown in the compensation tables payable to each NEO in the event of termination of such executive's employment by reason of retirement, death or disability, or within 24 months following a change in control to the extent such termination is without cause or the result of the executive's resignation for good reason. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018. The closing price of Company Common Stock on the NYSE on that date was $21.77. The amounts shown are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination under the circumstances specified. For purposes of the tables, calculations are based on the greater of the target award or the value earned for actual performance against the preset performance goals thorough the assumed date of termination. The actual amounts payable can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from the Company. 
Payments Made Upon Termination 
Regardless of the manner in which a NEO's employment terminates, he may be entitled to receive amounts earned during his term of employment. Such amounts include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• non-equity incentive compensation earned during the fiscal year;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amounts contributed under the savings portion of the defined contribution plan and the Benefit Restoration Plan;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• unused vacation pay; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• receive a prorated share of his outstanding equity awards when the shares subject to such awards would otherwise have become  payable as a result of the passage of time or the achievement of the applicable performance criteria; and

Payments Made Upon Death or Disability 
In the event of the death or disability of a NEO, in addition to the benefits listed under the headings "Payments Made Upon Termination" and "Payments Made Upon Retirement" above, the NEO may receive benefits under the Company's disability plan or payments under the Company's life insurance plan, as appropriate, each as generally available to all salaried employees. 
Payments Made Upon a Change in Control 
The Company is a party to a change in control severance agreement with each NEO that provides the NEO with payments in the event his employment is terminated by the Company for reasons other than cause or by the NEO for good reason (defined to include diminishment of pay, benefits, title or job responsibilities or transfer from the home office) within 24 months after a change in control. See the information under the caption "Employment and Change in Control Agreements" for definitions. The tables below illustrate the amount of payments due in various circumstances. 
As noted, the column "Involuntary Not for Cause Termination or Good Reason Termination by Executive (w/in 24 Months of a Change in Control)" assumes that there was a change in control at the December 31, 2018 closing price of $21.77 per share and all of the NEOs had a triggering event on December 31, 2018 and all cash amounts due, all deferred compensation enhancements, and all potential benefit payments were to be paid in a single lump sum.

ATI 2019 Proxy Statement    / 67 
Item 3 – Ratification of the Selection of Independent Auditors 
Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") serves as our independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditors"). They have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss audit findings and other financial matters. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors believes that Ernst & Young is knowledgeable about ATI's operations and accounting practices and is well qualified to act in the capacity of independent auditors. 
In appointing Ernst & Young as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and making its recommendation that stockholders ratify the selection, the Audit Committee considered whether the audit and non-audit services Ernst & Young provides are compatible with maintaining the independence of our outside auditors. 
If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent auditors. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young will be present at the Annual Meeting. They will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and they will be available to respond to appropriate questions following the Annual Meeting. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
Under the Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit Committee reviews and approves all services to be provided by Ernst & Young before the firm is retained to perform any such services. Under this policy, the engagement terms and fees of all audit services and all audit-related services are subject to the approval of the Audit Committee. In addition, while the Committee believes that the independent auditor may be able to provide tax services to the Company without impairing the auditor's independence, absent unusual circumstances, the Audit Committee does not expect to retain the independent auditor to provide tax services. Under the policy, the Committee has delegated limited pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Committee with respect to permitted, non-tax related services; the Chair is required to report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young in 2018 and 2017. 
Independent Auditor: Services and Fees 
The fees and expenses of Ernst & Young for the indicated services performed during 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Service       2018         2017     
 Service       2018         2017

 All other fees        118,000               2,000      
 Total    $   4,323,000           $   4,115,000      
[END TABLE]

"Audit-related fees" consisted of fees related to an audit of a pension plan.

Audit Committee Report 
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Roles and Responsibilities 
The Audit Committee monitors and oversees the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process. The Committee reviews and discusses management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP, our independent auditor, is responsible for performing an independent audit of ATI's financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), expressing an opinion as to their conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and for attesting to the effectiveness of the ATI's internal control over financial reporting. 
Required Disclosures and Discussions 
The Audit Committee has reviewed, met and held discussions with ATI's management, internal auditors, and the independent auditors regarding the financial statements, including a discussion of quality, not just acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles, and Ernst & Young's judgment regarding these matters. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the internal auditors and independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Committee met with the internal auditors and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the company's internal controls over financial reporting, and the overall quality of ATI's financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young matters required to be discussed by applicable auditing standards. 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Committee also considered the compatibility of non-audit services with Ernst & Young's independence. This information was also discussed with Ernst & Young. 
Committee Recommends Including the Financial Statements in the Annual Report 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Directors has approved this inclusion.

5.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial  owner?  
[END TABLE]
Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
Stockholders of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services, you are considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is being sent directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly, to vote electronically, or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you have requested printed materials, we have enclosed a proxy card for you to use. 
Beneficial Owners. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee who is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting, unless you request, complete and deliver a legal voting proxy from your broker, bank or nominee. If you requested printed materials, your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee regarding how to vote your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  How many votes can be cast by all stockholders?  
[END TABLE]
Each share of ATI Common Stock is entitled to one vote. There is no cumulative voting. We had 126,109,547 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  How many votes must be present to hold the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
A majority of the shares entitled to vote as of the record date must be present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting in order to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. This is called a "quorum." Your shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you properly cast your vote in person, electronically or telephonically, or a proxy card has been properly submitted by you or on your behalf. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  How many votes are required to elect directors (Item 1)?  
[END TABLE]
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the three individuals nominated for election to the Board of Directors who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically, telephonically or by proxy) will be elected. 
While directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, our Bylaws include a director resignation policy. This policy states that in an uncontested election, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election, as compared to votes "FOR" such election, must tender his or her resignation. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board is required to make recommendations to the Board with respect to any such tendered resignation. The Board will act on the tendered resignation within 90 days from the certification of the vote and will publicly disclose its decision, including its rationale. 
Only votes "FOR" or "WITHHELD" are counted in determining whether a plurality has been cast in favor of a director nominee; abstentions are not counted for purposes of the election of directors. If you withhold authority to vote with respect to the election of some or all of the nominees, your shares will not be voted with respect to those nominees indicated. For a "WITHHOLD" vote, your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum and will have a similar effect as a vote against that director nominee for purposes of our director resignation policy.

Full details of our director resignation policy are set forth in our Bylaws, which are available on our website at ATImetals.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  How many votes are required to adopt the other proposals (Items 2 and 3)?   
[END TABLE]
All of the other proposals will be approved if in each case they receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of ATI Common Stock represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. If your shares are represented at the Annual Meeting but you abstain from voting on any of these matters, your shares will be counted as present and entitled to vote on a particular matter for purposes of establishing a quorum, and the abstention will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. 
Your vote on Item 2 (executive compensation) is advisory, which means the result of the vote is non-binding. Although non-binding, the Board and its committees value the opinions of our stockholders and will review and consider the voting result when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  What if I don't give specific voting instructions?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you indicate when voting by Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by our Board, or if you return a signed proxy card but do not indicate how you wish to vote, then your shares will be voted: 
If you indicate a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon on your proxy card, the shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 
Beneficial Owners. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. In very limited circumstances, brokers have the discretion to vote on matters deemed to be routine. Under applicable law and the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers generally do not have discretion to vote on most matters. For example, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, the broker could vote your shares in its discretion with respect to the proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditors for 2019 (Item 3) because that is deemed to be a routine matter. We encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares. 
If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker and the broker has indicated that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular proposal, your shares will be considered "broker non-votes" with regard to that matter. Broker non-votes will be considered as represented for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of determining the number of votes cast with respect to a particular proposal and are not considered to be shares entitled to vote on non-routine matters. Thus, a broker non-vote will make a quorum more readily obtainable, but the broker non-vote will not otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on Items 1 and 2.

11.  How do I revoke or change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the meeting by: 
The latest-dated, timely, properly completed proxy that you submit, whether by mail, telephone or the Internet, will count as your vote. If a vote has been recorded for your shares and you subsequently submit a proxy card that is not properly signed and dated, the previously recorded vote will stand. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  What shares are included on the proxy or voting instruction card?   
[END TABLE]
The shares indicated on your proxy or voting instruction card represent those shares registered directly in your name, those held on account in the Company's dividend reinvestment plan and shares held in the Company's savings or retirement plans. If you do not cast your vote, your shares (except those held in the Company's savings or retirement plans) will not be voted. See question 14 for an explanation of the voting procedures for shares in the Company's savings or retirement plans. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card?   
[END TABLE]
If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, then you will receive more than one card. Please complete and return all of the proxy or voting instruction cards you receive (or vote by telephone or the Internet all of the shares on each of the proxy or voting instruction cards you receive) in order to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  How are shares that I hold in a company savings or retirement plan voted?   
[END TABLE]
If you hold ATI Common Stock in one of the Company's savings or retirement plans, then you may tell the plan trustee how to vote the shares of Common Stock allocated to your account. You may either sign and return the voting instruction card provided by the plan trustee or transmit your instructions by telephone or the Internet. If you do not transmit instructions, your plan shares will be voted as the plan administrator directs or as otherwise provided in the plan. 
The deadline for voting the shares you hold in the Company's savings or retirement plans by telephone or the Internet is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
ATI maintains a policy of keeping stockholder votes confidential. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Can I, in the future, receive the Notice or other proxy materials over the internet?   
[END TABLE]
Stockholders can elect to view future ATI notices and proxy materials over the Internet instead of receiving paper copies in the mail. This saves us the cost of producing and mailing these documents. Costs normally associated with electronic access, such as usage and telephone charges, will be borne by you. 
If you are a stockholder of record and you choose to vote over the Internet, you can choose to receive future materials electronically by following the prompt on the voting page when you vote using the Internet. If you hold your Company stock in street name (such as through a broker, bank or other nominee account), check the information provided by your nominee for instructions on how to elect to view future notices and other materials over the Internet. 
Stockholders who choose to view future proxy statements and annual reports over the Internet will receive instructions electronically that contain the Internet address for those materials, as well as voting instructions, approximately six weeks before future meetings, even in cases in which we otherwise mail full printed sets of our proxy materials. 
If you enroll to view ATI's future annual reports and proxy statements electronically and vote over the Internet, your enrollment will remain in effect for all future stockholders' meetings unless you cancel it. To cancel, stockholders of record should access computershare.com/investor and follow the instructions to cancel your enrollment. You should retain your control number appearing on your enclosed proxy or voting instruction card. If you hold your Company stock in "street name," check the information provided by your nominee holder for instructions on how to cancel your enrollment.

If at any time you would like to receive a paper copy of the annual report or proxy statement, please write to the Corporate Secretary, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, 1000 Six PPG Place, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222-5479. 
17. What is householding? 
The term "householding," means that we will deliver only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement to stockholders of record who share the same address and last name unless we have received contrary instructions from you. This procedure reduces our printing costs and mailing costs and fees. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate annual report and proxy statement to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of either of those documents was delivered. 
If you would like to receive a separate copy of the annual report or proxy statement for this meeting or opt out of householding, or if you are a stockholder eligible for householding and would like to participate in householding, please send a request addressed to ATI's Corporate Secretary at 1000 Six PPG Place, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-5479, or call (412) 394-2800. Many brokerage firms have instituted householding. If you hold your shares in "street name," please contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to request information about householding. 
2020 Annual Meeting and Stockholder Proposals

Stockholder proposals should be sent to the Corporate Secretary, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, 1000 Six PPG Place, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-5479. 
If you wish to submit director nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting, you must give timely notice of your intent to submit a proposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary. For such notices to be timely, notice must be received by the Corporate Secretary not less than 75 days and not more than 90 days before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting. For our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we must receive any such notice on or after February 9, 2020 and on or before February 24, 2020. The notice must contain certain information specified in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. The Committee will evaluate stockholder-recommended candidates on the same basis as other candidates. Stockholder recommendations should be sent to the Corporate Secretary at the address above, who will forward the information to the Committee. 
Stockholders may obtain copies of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws by writing to the Corporate Secretary at the address set forth above.

Other Business and Information
