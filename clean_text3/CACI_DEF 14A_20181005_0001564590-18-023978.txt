Board Composition

This governance structure allows the Board to provide focused advice, insight and oversight in the interests of the Company and our shareholders. The Board and its committees discharge their duties at Board and committee meetings, through telephone contact and other communications with management and others regarding matters of concern and interest to the Company. 
Primary Governance Documents

Board Leadership
The Board is responsible for determining the optimal leadership structure to provide independent oversight of senior management and evaluates the Board's leadership structure on an annual basis. In evaluating its leadership structure, the Board considers our current operating and governance environment, governance best practices and feedback from our shareholders on how the Board can provide effective oversight of senior management on behalf of our shareholders. Based on these considerations, the Board has determined that separate positions for Chairman and CEO, coupled with a Lead Independent Director, provides an efficient and effective leadership model, fostering clear accountability, differing perspectives and effective decision making as the Chairman focuses on the Board activities while the CEO manages the day to day business. The chart below summarizes the roles and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director:

Financial Performance Summary
Fiscal Year 2018 Performance
Below are charts outlining our performance over the last three fiscal years for the primary performance metrics used by the Compensation Committee in determining our NEOs' compensation. The performance metrics are shown without the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA") that occurred during fiscal year 2018, as that did  ExeCutive Compensation not affect NEO compensation (i.e., payouts were determined without the increases to earnings per share ("EPS") and net after tax profit ("NATP") caused by the legislation). The performance metrics were otherwise determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). 
The growth depicted in the performance charts had a substantial impact on our NEOs' earned compensation over the course of this period. For fiscal year 2018, this resulted in an average achievement of 222% of the targeted annual incentive plan value and the growth of the Company's stock price over the same period resulted in achievement of 143% of the performance-based equity awards granted to the NEOs during the fiscal year.
2017 Say on Pay Vote

   DECISION SUPPORT As the Compensation Committee made its fiscal year 2018 compensation decisions, it considered that 99% of the votes cast on the Company's fiscal year 2017 executive compensation program (the "Say on Pay" proposal) were voted in favor of the "Say on Pay" proposal at the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting. This continued the strong support as shown in 2016's 99% approval rate. The Company also actively engages with our shareholders to understand our shareholders' views towards the programs and reviews comments from shareholder advisory services.

Pay for Performance Philosophy
The Compensation Committee believes our executive compensation program should incent and reward behaviors that build a foundation for our long-term performance and success while also supporting the achievement of annual  ExeCutive Compensation objectives. Our performance assessment framework and executive compensation program are designed to reward such performance by linking our executives' compensation to the achievement of both long- and short-term goals. For example, the annual incentives paid to each of our NEOs vary with performance, including our annual financial results.  Additionally, the NEOs receive two types of long-term incentive plan awards that will result in payouts only if we achieve targeted growth in such measures as stock price performance, EPS, NATP and revenue.
Executive Compensation Program Design
The substantial majority of our NEOs' compensation is directly tied to our performance with short-term and long-term incentives comprising an average of approximately 80% of our NEOs' target total direct compensation ("TDC"). The following is a list of the principal components of our executive compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Character  Component  Description 
 Fixed  Base Salary• Annual fixed portion of NEOs' TDC designed to attract and retain experienced executives, comprising only approximately an average of 20% of our executives' target TDC.  
 At Risk  Annual Incentives• Cash bonus plan that rewards NEOs for achieving quarterly and annual performance objectives based on EPS, NATP, Total CACI Revenue and Direct Labor, calculated as described below. 
 Long-Term Incentives• Performance-based Restricted Stock Units ("PRSUs") earned based on achievement of a minimum one-year EPS threshold, adjusted for annual changes in stock price over a three-year period, and vesting on the third and fourth grant anniversaries.• Cash-based long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") provides value to the executive only to the extent NATP and revenue significantly outperformed plan over a three-year period.

Performance Assessment
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Committee   The Compensation Committee uses a comprehensive process to assess performance on an ongoing basis, which includes frequent dialogue with management about financial performance relative to our goals and competitors, and assessment of corporate and individual executive accomplishments. 
 Independent Consultant  The Compensation Committee also asks its independent compensation consultant to assess our pay-for-performance alignment, which includes an analysis of our NEOs' realizable pay relative to our peer group and an analysis of operational and shareholder returns relative to our peer group.

 Making Decisions   The Compensation Committee has both a strategic and administrative role in managing the compensation structure of the Company, with an emphasis on compensation of top management.  Strategically, the Compensation Committee considers how the achievement of the overall goals and objectives of the Company can be aided through  adoption of an appropriate compensation philosophy and effective program elements.   Administratively, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation paid, salary progressions, incentive compensation allocations, benefits and perquisites provided to all employees, and equity awards granted under all shareholder-approved plans.   The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the compensation, including incentive and equity-based compensation, of the Company's executive officers, including NEOs.   The Committee reviews corporate performance each quarter, and assesses progress for each goal in the annual incentive program and active long-term incentive programs from current and prior fiscal years. The Committee uses a performance assessment framework to make CEO compensation decisions. For the other NEOs, the Committee, with input from the CEO, reviews (1) business unit/staff group performance against the objectives set for the fiscal year, and (2) each NEO's Leadership Assessment based on individual performance with regard to key leadership attributes. The Committee evaluates each NEO's relative compensation and changes in responsibilities, and considers current pay practices for comparable positions at peer companies. The Committee also considers the CEO's recommendations, succession planning, retention, and advice of its independent compensation consultant. Finally, before making pay decisions, the Committee reviews the pay mix to ensure that it is competitively positioned and performance-based. The Committee also discusses other information relevant to executive compensation, such as trends, regulatory updates, and shareholder feedback.

Finally, before making pay decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews the pay mix to ensure that it is competitively positioned and performance-based.   PROGRAM DESIGN AND GOAL SETTING   At the end of fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee also finalized the fiscal year 2018 annual incentive plan. Early in fiscal year 2018, they also reviewed and approved the metrics and goals for the PRSUs and LTIP.

Assessing Competitive Practice
FW Cook assists the Committee by reviewing comparative market data on compensation practices and programs within the Company's peer group.
During fiscal year 2018, FW Cook was responsible for providing information on new laws and regulations, general industry compensation practices, and recommendations for director compensation and compensation for management positions under the Committee's purview, and for performing independent assessments of management recommendations brought before the Committee. FW Cook participated in all meetings of the Committee during the fiscal year.
For fiscal year 2018, peer comparisons were performed against 17 publicly traded companies which were selected based on similarities to CACI in size and/or industry as well as operational similarities. The selected companies were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Acxiom Corporation  Alliance Data Systems Corporation  Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 
 Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  Convergys Corporation  CSRA Inc.  Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. 
 Fiserv, Inc.  Harris Corporation  Leidos Holdings, Inc.  ManTech International Corporation 
 MAXIMUS, Inc.  Science Applications International Corporation  Sykes Enterprises, Inc.  Tetra Tech, Inc. 
 Unisys Corporation          
[END TABLE]
The companies used for peer comparisons are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary due to changes at the selected company (e.g., acquisitions, bankruptcies, etc.) or changes in the comparability of the selected company to CACI. For fiscal year 2018, Ciber, Inc. was removed from the list of peer companies due to its filing for bankruptcy in April 2017.
General industry market information for NEO and other senior executive compensation was also provided for the Compensation Committee by Willis Towers Watson, which did not provide advice or analysis regarding the data provided.

Fiscal Year 2018 Base Salaries 
In June 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed our NEOs' base salaries compared to the median of base salaries for comparable executives among our peer group and to reflect individual performance in fiscal year 2017. In addition, the Company's overall annual fiscal year 2018 merit increase guidance applicable to all employees was considered. After consideration the Committee decided to provide base salary adjustments for most NEOs equal to the Company's average fiscal year 2018 raise percentage, as all salaries were in line with the competitive median of the Company's peer group and the general industry market analysis. Due to timing of Ms. Gray's hiring late in fiscal year 2017, the Committee determined that her salary was still reasonable for fiscal year 2018 and decided not to make an adjustment; at the time the offer of employment was made to Ms. Gray, the salary offered was evaluated against her current salary, the competitive median for her offered position, and other internal executive officer salaries.
The adjustments approved by the Compensation Committee became effective August 1, 2017.

Target Annual Incentives
Our annual incentive program is a cash incentive plan designed to motivate our executive officers to achieve pre-established quarterly and annual performance objectives. In establishing target annual incentives for fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed our NEOs' total target cash compensation relative to our peers and made certain adjustments to more closely align our NEOs' total target cash compensation to the Company's peer group. The table below shows the fiscal year 2018 NEO target annual incentive levels that were approved by the Compensation Committee in June 2017. ExeCutive Compensation
Due to timing of Ms. Gray's hiring late in fiscal year 2017, she did not participate in the fiscal year 2017 annual incentive plan. In determining fiscal year 2018 target annual incentives, the Committee determined that the target annual incentive offered to Ms. Gray at the time of her employment was still reasonable for fiscal year 2018 and decided not to make an adjustment; at the time the offer of employment was made to Ms. Gray, the target annual incentive offered was evaluated against her current compensation, the competitive incentive levels for her offered position, and other internal executive officer compensation.

Fiscal Year 2018 Targets
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee establishes the performance metrics applicable to the annual and quarterly components of the annual incentive program. The performance metrics are selected to incent the Company's growth and meet the needs of the Company's shareholders, and are applied to each executive based on their responsibilities. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee selected the following performance metrics for our NEOs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Metric  Purpose    
 NATP    NATP is the primary indicator of our performance that is controlled by us and is used as the primary incentive metric to ensure our executives' focus on overall profitability.   
 NATP    NATP is the primary indicator of our performance that is controlled by us and is used as the primary incentive metric to ensure our executives' focus on overall profitability.   
 EPS  EPS is a measure of profitability that is commonly used by our shareholders in evaluating our performance.  
[END TABLE]
ExeCutive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Metric  Purpose    
 CACI Total Revenue  Revenue is our primary measure of growth which requires expansion of current business and the capture of new business. To incent organic growth, the Committee decided to evaluate whether to include acquired revenue in the measurement of this metric after the completion of each acquisition. For fiscal year 2018, CACI Total Revenue was computed in accordance with GAAP and included revenue from all acquisitions. 
 CACI Direct Labor  Direct labor is a measure of the amount of work performed by employees, as opposed to costs from other sources. It is also a measure of the quality of revenue, as increased direct labor can lead to organic growth and margin improvement. 
[END TABLE]
The following is a summary of the performance metrics applicable to each NEO for the annual and quarterly components of the annual incentive program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual  Quarterly  
 Metrics  Weight  Metrics  Weight  
 EPS  50%  NATP  50% 
 CACI Total Revenue  30%  CACI Total Revenue  30% 
 CACI Direct Labor  20%  CACI Direct Labor  20% 
 2018 Changes For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee replaced US Operations Organic Revenue with CACI Direct Labor as a metric in the annual incentive program. US Operations Organic Revenue was defined as revenue generated only from the Company's US-based operations and excluded all revenue from US-based acquisitions through the second anniversary of such acquisition, as a growth incentive. The Committee determined that direct labor provided incentive to grow organically via the hiring of new employees, while also incenting margin expansion. Further, as the fiscal year 2018 revenue plan included organic growth, it was determined there was not a need to have a separate organic revenue metric.

The performance targets for each metric are established based on the Company's five-year strategic plan, current business environment, review of the competitive market, historical performance against targets and the Company's desire for growth. 
Once performance targets are established for each performance metric, the Compensation Committee determines appropriate lower, or "Cut," threshold levels for each metric and upper, or "Stretch," threshold levels. For performance below Cut levels, no bonus is awarded. For performance at or above Cut levels, bonus payouts are prorated on a straight-line basis. For performance goals that represent profit metrics, bonus payouts for performance above Stretch levels are calculated as a percentage of the NEOs' respective metric performance.  Total payment for the annual incentive program is capped at 250% of the target payout for each NEO.
The ranges between Cut, Target and Stretch thresholds are based upon multiple factors assessed by the Compensation Committee, including historical ranges and historical performance against Target, Cut, and Stretch thresholds. For fiscal year 2018, for NATP and EPS, the Committee set the Cut thresholds at 94% of Target and Stretch thresholds at 104% of Target. For CACI Total Revenue and Direct Labor, the Committee set the Cut thresholds at 96% of Target and Stretch thresholds at 104% of Target. The higher Cut threshold for Total Revenue and Direct Labor was set to incent management to achieve targets for organic growth, as a 94% threshold would have provided an incentive payout even for a reduction in performance compared to fiscal year 2017.

Fiscal Year 2018 Performance
Performance relative to each metric used in calculating our NEOs' annual incentive payout is delineated below for fiscal year 2018 (in millions, except for EPS). The performance metrics do not include the impact of the TCJA, which was enacted during fiscal year 2018; the targets were set without anticipation of the TCJA, and the benefits of the TCJA were removed from the actual results when calculating incentive amounts. No benefit was provided to NEO payouts from the increases to NATP and EPS that resulted from the TCJA.

In consideration of the performance outlined above, the table below provides a summary of the annual incentives actually earned by our NEOs. The differences in the payouts as a percentage of target despite all NEOs having the same metrics is due to the impact of performing above Stretch for the NATP metric. Dr. London and Mr. Asbury receive 2.0% of the amount that NATP exceeds the Stretch level up to a total earned annual incentive of 250% of their target payout, and the other NEOs receive 1.5% of the amount that NATP exceeds the Stretch level up to a total earned annual incentive of 250% of their target payout.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs)
A significant portion of our NEOs' TDC is granted in the form of PRSUs that are designed to improve shareholder value and contribute to the growth and financial success of the Company. To receive any shares granted under the award, the Company must reach a minimum one-year EPS threshold. If the minimum threshold is met, then any earned shares are earned over a three-year performance period with the number of shares earned each year adjusted by the percentage growth or decline from the average stock price over 90 calendar days immediately preceding the grant to the average stock price over 90 calendar days immediately preceding the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to an overall cap of 200% of the target number of PRSUs granted. Once earned, the shares vest ratably on the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Below is a hypothetical example of how PRSUs are earned and vested:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Grant: 3,000 Shares (all earned amounts assume 10% annual stock price growth)   
 Grant: 3,000 Shares (all earned amounts assume 10% annual stock price growth)

 EPS Target Not Achieved  N/A  N/A  N/A  N/A 
[END TABLE]
The EPS threshold for fiscal year 2018 was set at $5.00. This was based on anticipated potential delays from new business awards compared to what was in the fiscal year 2018 plan, which was considered to be a realistic possibility given the dynamics of the government services industry.
During the annual review of the equity program, the Compensation Committee considered other formats, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, non-performance-based RSUs, performance-based equity that leverages other financial metrics approved within the CACI 2016 Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan, and performance-based equity based on relative performance metrics against a defined peer group or stock market index. Regarding the use of relative performance metrics, it was determined that the existing and anticipated turnover of companies in the competitive market due to acquisitions, spin-offs, privatization, new public offerings and other similar transactions made the measurement over a three-year period unfeasible at this time. Further, feedback from our investors in recent years about the potential usage of a stock market index for a relative performance metric indicated that such a metric would receive little support. ExeCutive Compensation
The Compensation Committee used market data provided by its compensation consultants to set the dollar value of equity for the NEOs. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee made certain adjustments to align our NEOs with the median of our peer group.
For Dr. London, it was determined that his equity compensation was significantly below that of the peer group and his target equity value merited an increase to bring his compensation in line with other comparable executives.
Due to the timing of Ms. Gray's hiring, she did not participate in the fiscal year 2017 PRSU grant.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (Cash)
The LTIP is a separate plan, independent of other incentive programs administered by the Compensation Committee.  The LTIP is a cash-based plan, designed to incent long-term growth and profitability, with performance metrics set at very challenging levels. The Compensation Committee selected NATP and revenue as performance metrics for the LTIP to incent higher levels of long-term growth along these important metrics. Although performance under our annual incentive plan is evaluated along these same metrics, the LTIP targets are set well above the annual incentive plan levels. For fiscal year 2018, metrics were set 6% higher than the annual incentive plan target (a total of 10% above the Company's plan).
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Compensation Committee has sole discretion in selecting participants in the LTIP, with participation intended to be limited to people most directly able to impact the achievement of the metrics in the line, business development, and key staff organizations. Among the NEOs, Mr. Mengucci, Mr. Mutryn and Ms. Gray participated in the LTIP for fiscal year 2018.

[END TABLE]
The cash incentives under the LTIP are distributed at the end of a three-year period, with a third of the value earned on a one-year performance period, a third of the value earned on a cumulative two-year performance period and a third of the value earned on a cumulative three-year performance period that are each established at the time the target award is determined. To ensure that our participating NEOs are challenged, the performance required for payouts under the LTIP are set beyond the Stretch levels established under the annual incentive plan.  ExeCutive Compensation
The Compensation Committee generally sets the LTIP target value for each participant to match his or her aggregate annual incentive plan target bonus levels over the thee-year period. As the metrics were intended to have a high level of difficulty to achieve, the Compensation Committee determined that market data provided by its compensation consultants did not directly apply to the determination of the bonus potential. For Mr. Mengucci, Mr. Mutryn, and Ms. Gray, the Compensation Committee set their annual bonus potential equal to:

Other Compensation Policies and Practices
Benefits and Executive Perquisites
All NEOs are entitled to receive a Company-provided automobile or an allowance to obtain an automobile. In fiscal year 2018 the Compensation Committee also approved a new benefit for Dr. London to receive a full-time car service; this benefit will take effect during fiscal year 2019. All automobile benefits are fully taxable as ordinary income; no tax gross-up is provided. ExeCutive Compensation
All NEOs are also eligible for annual financial planning services. The value of these services are also fully taxable as ordinary income; no tax gross-up is provided.
In addition, we provide a $25,000 discretionary benefit allowance per calendar year to the President and Chief Executive Officer and to the Chairman of the Board and Executive Chairman. This allowance can be used for business or personal expenses. All personal benefit received from this allowance is fully taxable as ordinary income; no tax gross-up is provided. 
Furthermore, Dr. London has a medical agreement that provides lifetime participation in the Company's executive medical plan for him and his spouse to the extent permitted by law, with such participation on the same basis that existed just prior to any merger, consolidation, or change in control of the Company. 
Executives are also permitted to participate in the Company's other employee benefit plans on substantially the same terms as other employees. For example, the Company makes matching contributions to our 401(k) plan based on employee contributions, and executives receive the same benefit.
All amounts related to perquisites for NEOs are disclosed in column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table, along with details on their valuations.
Severance and Change in Control Benefits
The Company currently maintains severance agreements with all NEOs except for Ms. Gray, for whom the Committee anticipates completing a severance agreement in fiscal year 2019. The purpose of the agreements is to provide those executives with a degree of security and to mitigate concern that they might have regarding their continued employment prior to or following a change in control, thereby allowing the executive to focus their undivided attention to serving the interests of the Company and our shareholders. The Company believes that appropriate severance arrangements are necessary to attract and retain these key executives and are an important part of a competitive overall compensation program for the NEOs. 
In the event of a change in control, the severance benefits are generally payable only upon a "double trigger," meaning that severance benefits are triggered when an eligible executive is involuntarily terminated without cause by the Company or resigns for "good reason" within one year following a change in control. This "double trigger" provision was implemented to be consistent with good market practices. We believe this program encourages retention in the face of an actual or potential change in control and aligns executive and shareholder interests. Furthermore, the program allows top executives to review corporate transactions that are in the best interests of our shareholders without concern over whether the transactions may adversely impact the executive's employment.
Per the terms of his employment agreement, Dr. London is entitled to severance benefits if he voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason within one year of a change in control; this term was negotiated in good faith with Dr. London in 2007 and was part of prior employment agreements, and the Compensation Committee has decided that new employment agreements will contain a "double trigger" provision as outlined in the preceding paragraph.
All equity awards granted since 2010 have provided for "double trigger" vesting acceleration in the event of a change in control, under which vesting accelerates only upon a change in control and involuntary termination without cause or resignation for good reason within one year after the change of control. 
The following separation terms also apply to the Company's long-term incentive programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    RSU Grants:   Grant recipients over age 62 as of July 1, 2008 ("grandfathered employees") who retire at or above age 65 vest in all RSUs upon retirement unless the RSUs are still in the first year of their measurement period, in which case they are forfeited upon retirement. Non-grandfathered executives who retire at age 62 or older vest in a prorated portion of the RSUs based upon their number of months of service after the grant date divided by the full vesting timeframe; the numbers of RSUs received are still subject to the results of the performance conditions. A grantee

     terminated without cause is entitled to the same treatment as a non-grandfathered executive retiring at age 62 or older. Dr. London is the only grandfathered executive among the NEOs.

    LTIP:  In the event of a change in control during the three-year performance period, participants will receive payment for bonuses earned for completed fiscal years as well as for the annual bonus potential for the current fiscal year at the time the change in control event is legally consummated and binding (subject to IRS regulations or other laws/regulations). 
[END TABLE]
Calculations for various termination scenarios are included in the "Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy statement.
Retirement Plans
The Company offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to encourage employees to save for their retirement. Eligible employees, which include all NEOs, may elect to contribute up to 50% of their U.S. base salary and 100% of their U.S. bonuses and commissions to this plan on a pre-tax basis. The Company contributes 5% of all cash compensation over the compensation limit in IRC section 401(a)(17) to participants, subject to plan vesting conditions, and may make a supplemental discretionary contribution to a participant's account in any amount it elects. No discretionary contributions were made in fiscal year 2018. 
In the past, Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP") have been provided to NEOs to offset the loss of benefits from previous employers to acquire their services and are, therefore, consistent with the Company's philosophy of attracting and retaining critical talent. Mr. Mengucci was offered a SERP as part of his employment offer, and it will become effective upon its finalization. The Company provides no other executive a SERP and does not anticipate doing so in the future.
Management Stock Purchase Plan
The Company offers a Management Stock Purchase Plan ("MSPP") to promote the long-term growth and profitability of the Company by providing executives with incentives to improve shareholder value and to contribute to the growth and financial success of the Company. The MSPP also helps executives to meet their mandated stock ownership requirements. The Board believes that the MSPP serves these goals, encouraging executives to convert a higher percentage of their cash compensation into Company equity.
The MSPP provides for equity ownership in the Company by senior officers by allowing the voluntary deferral of up to 100% of the annual portion of their annual incentive plan compensation into RSUs. All deferred shares are bought at a discount of up to 15%, as determined annually by the Compensation Committee, of fair market value. The Company may grant matching awards in an amount not to exceed 25% of the participant's deferrals and subject to such vesting or other restrictions or conditions as the Compensation Committee determines. 
The amount of the discount to fair market value and matching grant is determined by the Compensation Committee no later than December 31st of the fiscal year in which the bonus is earned (or as otherwise specified in the MSPP for matching awards that qualify under IRC section 162(m)). During fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a 15% discount with no matching.
The benefit provided from MSPP purchases for each NEO is listed in column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table. ExeCutive Compensation
Stock Ownership Requirements
The Compensation Committee maintains executive stock ownership requirements for its senior officers to focus those executives on the long-term growth in value of the Company and to ensure they act as owners of the Company. The stock ownership requirements are based on a multiple of the executive's salary as set forth below and the number of shares required to be held is determined annually based on the 90-day average stock price on July 1. The required multiple for each executive is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee to ensure that it provides enough incentive to properly align the interests of senior management with those of our shareholders. 
Until an executive meets the required number of shares, they are limited with respect to the number of shares they are allowed to sell, and are only allowed to sell one-half of the vested RSUs remaining after payment of taxes (standard practice is to sell a portion of shares that vest to cover the tax burden caused by the vesting); the other one-half that must be retained is used to determine the interim ownership requirement until the full number of shares is reached, with each successive vesting being added to the prior interim requirement in order to establish the new requirement.
Based on the requirements, the full number of shares required to be held by each of our NEOs, the multiple of each executive's base salary full ownership would represent, and the requirement as of July 1, 2018 is in the table below. The Compensation Committee believes these salary multiples are robust and above comparable peer levels.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name  Full Share Requirement    Multiple of Salary  Requirement as of July 1, 2018 
 Name  Full Share Requirement    Multiple of Salary  Requirement as of July 1, 2018 
  J.P. London  36,300  7x  36,300

  Thomas A. Mutryn  29,700  7x  29,700 
  DeEtte Gray  31,700  7x  — 
[END TABLE]
To encourage compliance, a noncompliant senior officer is required to participate in the MSPP with 100% of the annual portion of their annual incentive plan compensation going toward the purchase of RSUs until such time that they meet the required holding level. 
All NEOs are in compliance with their respective stock ownership requirements as of July 1, 2018. 
Compensation Clawback Policy
We maintain a formal "clawback" policy for incentive awards that is broader in its reach than that imposed by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The policy covers incentive awards to "officers" (as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act), and was adopted in fiscal year 2010. Under the policy, in the event of a restatement of previously reported financial results, the Compensation Committee may require reimbursement of the incremental portion of incentive awards paid to executive officers in excess of the awards that should properly have been paid based on the restated financial results.  ExeCutive Compensation
By way of comparison, the clawback imposed by Section 304 of SOX (which applies to CACI) is limited to the CEO and CFO and is based on material noncompliance by the issuer, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting obligation under the federal securities laws where such noncompliance requires the issuer to restate its financials. The SOX provision looks back one year and requires the issuer to recover all bonus or incentive-based or equity-based compensation paid to the CEO and CFO (in cases of misconduct). The Securities and Exchange Commission enforces Section 304; there is no private right of action.
The Compensation Committee is monitoring this policy to ensure that it remains consistent with applicable laws, including emerging requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Impact of Regulatory Requirements
The Compensation Committee seeks regular updates on changes in regulations affecting compensation and how they impact executive compensation. The Compensation Committee considers applicable regulatory requirements when making compensation decisions and seeks to ensure that Company compensation plans continue to meet such requirements.
Prior to its amendment by the TCJA, which was enacted December 22, 2017, section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"), disallowed a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to "covered employees" under Section 162(m) (generally, such company's chief executive officer and its three other highest paid executive officers other than its chief financial officer). Prior to this amendment, there was an exception to this $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation if certain requirements were met. The Compensation Committee has historically designed its compensation programs based on its belief that a substantial portion of the compensation payable to NEOs should be based on the achievement of performance-based targets or otherwise be designed with the intent that such compensation qualify as deductible performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). 
The TCJA generally amended Section 162(m) to eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation, effective for taxable years following December 31, 2017.  The $1 million compensation limit was also expanded to apply to a public company's chief financial officer and apply to certain individuals who were covered employees in years other than the then-current taxable year.  Although certain transition relief may apply with respect to compensation paid pursuant to certain contracts in effect as of November 2, 2017, ambiguities in the TCJA prevent the Compensation Committee from being able to definitively determine what compensation, if any, payable to the covered employees in excess of $1 million will be deductible in future years.  Interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other factors beyond the control of the Compensation Committee can affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive officers who are covered by Section 162(m) will be deductible. As in prior years, the Compensation Committee will continue to take into account the tax and accounting implications (including with respect to the expected lack of deductibility under the revised Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions, but reserves its right to make compensation decisions based on other factors as well if the Compensation Committee determines it is in its best interests to do so.  Further, taking into account the elimination of the exception for performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee may determine to make changes or amendments to its existing compensation programs in order to revise aspects of our programs that were initially designed to comply with Section 162(m) but that may no longer serve as an appropriate incentive measure for our executive officers. 
Risk Assessment
The Company has a Chief Risk Officer and among his tasks are attending meetings of the Compensation Committee and performing an annual assessment of the Company's overall compensation risk profile. The Compensation Committee also engages FW Cook to perform an independent risk assessment of the Company's executive and non-executive compensation programs.  ExeCutive Compensation
As a part of these risk assessments, the Chief Risk Officer and FW Cook have made the following findings about CACI's compensation programs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Board and the Compensation Committee exercise close oversight over the performance measures utilized by the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which in combination serve to balance short-term and long-term performance requirements, and enhance shareholder value; 
• the performance objectives of the plans are linked such that achievement of annual incentive plan measures serves to enhance the performance of the Company while also supporting the goals established for the long-term incentive plan; 
• the balance of total compensation is more heavily weighted to long-term incentives, and increasing the stock price over the long-term provides the maximum incentive value; and 
• the Company has a rigorous system of internal controls designed to prevent any individual employee from creating adverse material risk in pursuit of short- or long-term compensation.  For example, the Board must approve all capital outlays of $10 million or more, as well as all acquisitions and divestitures of $5 million or more. 
[END TABLE]
Based on these analyses, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk-taking.

 (2)  The Company made a $250,000 sign-on bonus to Ms. Gray in fiscal year 2017. The Company did not make any other non-performance based bonus payments to any NEOs in fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. 
 (3)  The amounts reported in the Stock Awards column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of each restricted stock unit granted during such year, as computed in accordance with ASC 718. See Note 21 of the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2018. RSUs awarded to all NEOs were in the form of performance-based RSUs (PRSUs). The grant date fair value of Mr. Mengucci's November 28, 2017 grant was equal to the closing stock price on that day ($129.85). The grant date fair value of all other PRSU awards was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Mr. Mengucci's November 28, 2017 grant is based on the Company's EPS performance in the year ending June 30, 2019. All other PRSUs granted are based on the Company's performance during the year ended June 30, 2018 and the Company's average stock price for the 90-day period ended September 15, 2018 as compared to the Company's average stock price for the 90-day period ended September 15, 2017. The award is currently at 143% of the target award; if we achieve maximum performance conditions for this grant (200% of the target amount of PRSUs due to growth in the Company's stock price), then the cash value of the resulting awards would be 332% of the amounts shown in the table. Based on the Company's performance during the year ended June 30, 2017 and the Company's average stock price for the 90-day period ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 as compared to the Company's average stock price for the 90 day period ended September 30, 2016, the award is currently at 163% of the target award; if we achieve maximum performance conditions for this grant (200% of the target amount of PRSUs due to growth in the Company's stock price), then the cash value of the resulting awards would be 328% of the amounts shown in the table. Based on the Company's performance during the year ended June 30, 2016 and the Company's average stock price for the 90-day period ended September 18, 2018, September 18, 2017 and September 18, 2016 as compared to the Company's average stock price for the 90-day period ended September 18, 2015, the PRSUs granted in fiscal year 2016 resulted in 167% of the target award level.  
 (4)  Amounts reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column represent performance-based incentive compensation earned in fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016.  Mr. Mengucci's, Mr. Mutryn's and Ms. Gray's Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation includes amounts earned under the LTIP that will be paid in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. For more information regarding these awards and the amounts thereof, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Incentives" and "- Fiscal Year 2018 Long-Term Incentives – Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)(Cash)."

CEO Pay Ratio
In accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Asbury to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than Mr. Asbury) was computed to be 71 to 1 for fiscal year 2018, based on the methodology described below.
As of June 30, 2018, our total employee population consisted of approximately 18,640 individuals, including our CEO. We compared the annual base salary or wages of all employees (other than Mr. Asbury), as reflected in our human resources systems of record; as part of this process we annualized compensation of employees who were employed for less than the full fiscal year, but we did not annualize the compensation of employees in temporary or seasonal positions  COMPENSATION TABLES
or make full-time equivalent adjustments for part-time employees. This measure was consistently applied to all individuals in the measured employee population to identify our median employee.
We then calculated the annual total compensation of the median employee for fiscal year 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our CEO in the Summary Compensation Table. This yielded compensation for the median employee of $100,949.
The annual total compensation of Mr. Asbury, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above was $7,121,764. The ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Asbury to the compensation of the median employee was then computed, yielding the final result of 71 to 1. We believe this is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio permit companies to use various methodologies, estimates and assumptions and, as result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio. 
Severance Agreements
The term of each NEO's severance agreement is one year with automatic one-year extensions thereafter (except for the agreement provided to the President and Chief Executive Officer which is three years with automatic one-year extensions thereafter), unless the Company provides written notice of the Company's intent to amend the Company's severance policy with respect to its senior executives and to apply the amended policy to the executive. In the event the Company provides such notice to the executive, agreements expire by their terms at the end of the full-term year that begins on the next July 1st following the date such notice is received by the executive officer.
Per the terms of the agreements, each executive's employment may be terminated by the Company without a separation payment of any kind in the event of death or a termination for cause as determined by the Board.
In the event of a termination by the Company for disability, the Company is generally required to provide 30 days' notice, and pay any incentive compensation earned but unpaid as of the date of termination for any fiscal year prior to the year in which such termination occurs.
In the event of termination without cause by the Company or resignation for "good reason" by the executive, as defined in the agreements, the Company will pay a severance payment equal to a specified number of months of the executive's base salary, prorated cash incentive compensation payments otherwise payable under the executive's incentive compensation plan for the fiscal year of termination, and continued participation in the Company's health care plan for a defined period of time. Further, for unvested stock grants, the terms of the grant agreements entitle the recipient to receive a prorated portion of the unvested stock based upon the number of full months of service divided by the total vesting timeframe. When the executive's resignation is not associated with a change in control, "good reason" is defined as (i) a material reduction in the executive's total compensation and benefit opportunity (other than a reduction made by the Board, acting in good faith, based upon the performance of the executive, or to align the compensation and benefits of the executive with that of comparable executives, based on market data); or (ii) a substantial adverse alteration in the conditions of the executive's employment.
In the event of a termination without cause or resignation for "good reason" within one year after the effective date of a change in control, the agreements provide that the Company will pay similar termination payments as in the preceding paragraph but require the executive's base salary to be paid for a higher number of specified months and a specified payment based on the average incentive compensation earned by the executive for the five fiscal years immediately preceding the termination (except that in Dr. London's case, he is also entitled to such termination payment if he voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason within one year of a change in control). Further, in the event of a termination without cause or resignation for "good reason" within one year after the effective date of a change in control, the terms of the grant agreements entitle the recipients to receive all of their unvested stock. In the event of a change in control, "good reason" is defined as (i) a substantial adverse alteration in the nature or status of the executive's position or responsibilities from those in effect on the day before the change in control date; or (ii) a change in the  COMPENSATION TABLES
geographic location of the executive's job by more than 50 miles from the place at which such job was based on the day before the change in control date.
The table below delineates the benefits upon separation for each NEO with an existing separation agreement under the scenarios as described above:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    London  Asbury  Mutryn  Mengucci 
 Salary Multiple: Termination for Good Reason or Involuntary Termination Without Cause    1.5x  2x  1x  1x 
 Salary Multiple: Termination for Good Reason or Involuntary Termination Without Cause    1.5x  2x  1x  1x 
 Salary Multiple: Upon Change in Control and Termination for Good Reason (or, in the case of Dr. London, any reason) or Involuntary Termination Without Cause    3x  2x  2x  2x 
 Bonus Multiple: Upon Change in Control and Termination for Good Reason or Involuntary Termination Without Cause (average annual payment for last five years)  2x  2x  1.5x  1.5x 
[END TABLE]
The agreements also restrict each executive officer's rights to compete with the Company or to offer employment to Company employees following termination.
No changes to existing agreements have been made since the beginning of fiscal year 2018.
Ms. Gray does not currently have an agreement, but the Compensation Committee anticipates completing an agreement during fiscal year 2019. Until such time as an agreement is implemented, standard Company policy applies. For Ms. Gray's position, this policy provides for six month's salary upon involuntary separation without cause.
Calculations for various termination scenarios are included in the "Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control" section below.
Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control
The table below reflects the amount of compensation payable to each NEO upon termination of employment under various termination scenarios. The tables show the amount of compensation payable to each NEO upon voluntary termination (other than for "good reason") or retirement not in connection with a change in control, upon termination by the Company without cause or by the NEO for "good reason" other than in connection with a change in control, and upon termination by the Company without cause or by the NEO for "good reason" (or, in the case of Dr. London, any reason) following a change in control. The amounts shown assume, for illustrative purposes, that such termination was effective as of June 30, 2018, and therefore include amounts earned through such date, and are estimates of the amounts which  COMPENSATION TABLES
would be paid to the NEOs upon termination. The actual amounts to be paid can be determined only at the time of the actual separation from the Company.

 (1)  For Messrs. Mengucci and Mutryn and Ms. Gray, this also includes the annual bonus potential for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 LTIP, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of those plans. For the Separation Payment following a Change in Control, includes incentive plan amounts earned but not yet paid for fiscal year 2018 for all NEOs. 
 (2)  Assumes that Dr. London is entitled to receive lifetime medical benefits as previously described, and that Messrs. Asbury, Mengucci, and Mutryn are entitled to receive continuation of health benefits following the date of separation for reasons other than voluntary termination or retirement. For Dr. London, the table value therefore represents the present value (using a discount rate of 2.48%) of continued current medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage less the estimated portion of the cost, plus the amount required to cover all estimated applicable local, state and federal income and payroll taxes imposed with respect to such payments over Dr. London's expected life span (based upon IRS Life Expectancy Tables). For Messrs. Asbury, Mengucci, and Mutryn, the table value represents the total values of continued current medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage over the duration of the coverage period, less the executive's current portion of the cost, plus the amount required to cover all estimated applicable local, state and federal income and payroll taxes imposed with respect to such payment. 
 (3)  Represents the value of monies deferred into the non-qualified retirement plan during employment, plus investment gains and losses, that would be payable upon termination. 
 (4)  Represents the value of all Company contributions paid into the non-qualified retirement plan on behalf of the executive officer during employment that would be payable upon termination. In the event of termination for "Good Reason" or without cause within one year after the effective date of a Change in Control, all unvested Company contributions would vest. 
 (5)  Based on the number of RSUs that would vest and the terms of RSU grants as described in the "Severance and Change in Control Benefits" section, multiplied by the closing price per share of the Company's common stock as of June 30, 2018. For the performance-based grants made in September 2015, September 2016, and September 2017, the maximum number of RSUs for which the measurement periods were not complete would result upon a change in control. 
 (6)  As described above under "Severance Agreements," two named executive officers have legacy entitlements to partial protection against IRC section 280G excise taxes in the event of termination after a change in control. Specifically, their severance agreements provide for a one-time payment to the executive equal to the lesser of two-thirds of the excise tax to the executive and $500,000. Based on the assumptions used in the preparation of the table, no payments would be due to the executives under this termination scenario. 
 (7)  Assumes that the executive officer resigned for "good reason" or was terminated without cause within one year after a change in control. Dr. London is entitled to this payment if he voluntarily terminates his employment for any reason within one year after a change in control. Ms. Gray would be entitled to the cash severance only upon termination without cause by the Company.

 Director Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Summary 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation and form of compensation for non-employee directors annually. As a part of this process, the Compensation Committee reviews general market data for director compensation as well as director compensation data from the Company's peer group, the same group used for our executive compensation review, including cash compensation, equity compensation and stock ownership requirements. The Compensation Committee also considers input from FW Cook, the third-party compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee, regarding market practices for director compensation.  The Compensation Committee intends to set director compensation levels at or near the market median relative to directors at companies of comparable size, industry, and scope of operations in order to ensure directors are paid competitively for their time commitment and responsibilities. As a result, non-employee director compensation generally approximates the market median and is periodically adjusted to maintain alignment with market practices. The Compensation Committee intends to continue to conduct director compensation reviews annually.
Each non-employee director is compensated according to the following arrangements for his or her service as a director, including participation in meetings of the full Board and the committee(s) of which he or she is a member:

 (1)  Equity grants are made in the form of RSUs expressed as a dollar value, in an amount established from time to time by the Compensation Committee. Such RSU awards are made on the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders at which time such election occurs, based on the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on that date. Under the Company's Director Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP), Directors may also elect to receive RSUs in lieu of up to one hundred percent of their annual cash retainer, with such election to be made prior to the commencement of the effective calendar year. The number of RSUs is based on the fair market value of the stock on the date of issuance. 
 (2)  Members of the Executive Committee are compensated on a per meeting basis.  
 (3)  The base number of meetings for the Board and each applicable committee is up to 4 meetings per Fiscal Year.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Dr. London and Mr. Asbury received no separate compensation for their service as directors, except that they were eligible to be reimbursed for incurred expenses associated with attending meetings of the Board and its committees, such as when meetings were conducted at offsite locations.

[END TABLE]
The Committee has also adopted stock ownership requirements for non-employee directors to better align their interests with those of our shareholders. The requirement is based on five times the value of their base annual retainer ($65,000), converted annually on December 1st to a whole number of shares based on the 90-day average price of CACI stock. Until the Director holds the required number of shares, the director is limited with respect to the number of shares the director is allowed to sell, and is only allowed to sell one-half of the shares issued with respect to vested RSUs for the purpose of covering the tax burden caused by the vesting; the other one-half that must be retained is used to determine the interim ownership requirement until the full number of shares is reached, with each successive vesting being added to the prior interim requirement in order to establish the new requirement. Only fully owned shares count in the measurement; unvested restricted stock units do not count, nor do any other unvested and/or unexercised instruments. The penalty for non-compliance is that the Director is required to participate in the DSPP with 100 percent of the director's earned annual retainer and committee fees being applied to the acquisition of CACI stock, until the director meets the required holding level.
Stockholdings are measured annually as of December 1st to determine compliance with the plan. For the compliance checkpoint on December 1, 2017, this requirement translated into a requirement to hold 2,582 fully owned shares for Messrs. Daniels and Jews, and 3,041 fully owned shares for all other directors. The required ownership level will continue to be reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that it provides enough incentive to properly align the interests of the outside directors with those of the Company's shareholders. 
All non-employee directors currently meet their required stock ownership requirement. Equity Compensation Plan Information

Under the terms of the 2016 Plan, the Company may issue, among other awards, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and SSARs. The DSPP allows Directors to elect non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock-settled appreciation rights (SSARs).  The DSPP allows Directors to elect to receive RSUs at the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of the award in lieu of up to 100 percent of their annual retainer fees.  The MSPP allows those senior executives with stock holding requirements a mechanism to receive RSUs at 85 percent of the fair market value of the Company's common stock in lieu of up to 100 percent of their annual bonus compensation.  The ESPP allows eligible full-time employees to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at 95 percent of its fair market value on the last day of the quarter.

 Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the approval of all audit and non-audit services that are to be performed by the Company's independent auditors. This policy generally provides that the Company will not engage its independent auditors to render audit or non-audit services unless the service is specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement is entered into pursuant to one of the pre-approval procedures described below. All such audit services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
From time to time, the Audit Committee may pre-approve specified types of services that are expected to be provided to the Company by its independent auditors during the next 12 months. Any such pre-approval is detailed as to the particular services or type of services to be provided and is also generally subject to a maximum dollar amount.
The Audit Committee has also delegated to the chairman of the Audit Committee the authority to approve any audit or non-audit services to be provided to the Company by its independent auditors. Any approval of services by the chairman pursuant to this delegated authority is reported on at the next meeting of the Audit Committee. The Pre-Approval Policy is set forth on the Corporate Governance page of our website at www.caci.com. AUDIT INFORMATION
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018
In accordance with the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company. The Audit Committee Charter was first adopted by the Board in June 1994 and has been reviewed annually and amended as necessary since that date. Each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as "independent" in accordance with Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, Sections 303A.01, 303A.02, 303A.06, and 303A.07. In fulfilling its responsibilities as set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee has accomplished the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.  It has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management, including discussions regarding critical accounting policies, financial accounting and reporting principles and practices, the quality of such principles and practices, the reasonableness of significant judgments and estimates, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; 
 2.  It has discussed with the independent auditors the quality of the financial statements, the clarity of the related disclosures, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and other items required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees; 
 3.  It has received from the independent auditors written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and discussed with the independent auditors any matters affecting their independence; and 
 4.  Based on the review and discussions described in subparagraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

 (1)  Under his employment agreement, if Mr. Asbury no longer serves as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, terminates his employment for any reason or provides notice to the Company regarding such a termination, he shall resign from the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Unless instructed otherwise, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote the shares of common stock represented by the proxy FOR the election of the eleven nominees listed above. In the event that any nominee becomes unavailable or unwilling to serve as a member of our Board, the proxy holders will vote in their discretion for a substitute nominee. 
You can find more information about the leadership skills and other experiences that caused the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board to determine that these nominees should serve as directors under "Board of Directors" on page 5 of this proxy statement.  Information about our nominating procedures and other corporate governance matters can be found under "Corporate Governance" on page 12 of this proxy statement. 
Required Vote
A majority of the votes properly cast for a director nominee is sufficient to elect such director (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such director nominee). Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect on the election of nominees. 
The election of directors is deemed a non-routine matter under NYSE rules and a beneficial owner's nominee will not be able to vote on the election of directors without instructions. We encourage all beneficial owners to provide voting instructions to such parties to ensure that their shares are voted at the Annual Meeting.
CACI Recommendation
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election to the Board of each of the above mentioned nominees.  MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS

 Proposal 2  Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement. While this vote is advisory, it will provide information to our Compensation Committee regarding investor sentiment about our compensation principles and objectives. We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 22, compensation tables and related narratives appearing in this proxy statement for more information regarding the compensation of our named executive officers. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the philosophy and structure of our compensation program for our named executive officers as well as the overall compensation of those officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board or the Compensation Committee. To the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of shareholders.
Our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders. At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved our fiscal year 2016 named executive officers' compensation, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and compensation tables, as well as the other narrative executive compensation disclosures contained in the definitive proxy statement for our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our shareholders approved the resolution on executive compensation with over 99% of the votes cast being cast in favor of our executive compensation.  Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion."
Required Vote
On this non-binding matter, a majority of the votes properly cast on this matter (meaning the number of shares voted "for" this matter must exceed the number of shares voted "against" this matter) is necessary for the matter to be approved. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.
A shareholder's advisory vote on executive compensation is deemed a non-routine matter under NYSE rules and a beneficial owner's nominee will not be able to vote on executive compensation without instructions. We encourage all beneficial owners to provide voting instructions to such parties to ensure that their shares are voted at the Annual Meeting.
CACI Recommendation
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal 3  Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
Ernst & Young LLP currently serves as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and that firm conducted the audit of the Company's accounts for fiscal year 2018. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to conduct an audit of the Company's accounts for fiscal year 2019.
Selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company for ratification. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the Audit Committee to be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the audit work of the independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board of Directors is submitting this matter to the shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Required Vote
A majority of the votes properly cast on this matter (meaning the number of shares voted "for" this matter must exceed the number of shares voted "against" this matter) is necessary for the matter to be approved.  Because this is a "routine matter" under NYSE rules, a beneficial owner's nominee, such as a broker, may vote on the ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm without instruction from their beneficial owners. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect on the vote for this proposal.  If the shareholders fail to vote in favor of the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain Ernst & Young LLP and may retain that firm or another without re-submitting the matter to the Company's shareholders. Even if shareholders vote in favor of the appointment, on an advisory basis, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and the shareholders.
CACI Recommendation
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION

[END TABLE]

ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
Shareholders Entitled to Vote
All shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 17, 2018 may vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting.
As of the Record Date, there were 24,732,207 shares of common stock outstanding. A complete list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Company's headquarters for examination from November 1, 2018 through November 15, 2018 for any purpose related to the Annual Meeting.
Shareholder of Record or Beneficial Owner
If your shares are registered directly with Computershare, N.A., our transfer agent, then you are the "shareholder of record" of the shares. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank, trust or other similar organization, then you are a "beneficial owner" of the shares. Most of our shareholders are beneficial owners of their shares.
There are several distinctions in how shareholders receive information and vote their shares that you should be aware of and we have described such differences in the proxy materials. 
Voting at the Annual Meeting 
Shareholders of record can receive a ballot and vote when they arrive at the Annual Meeting. Beneficial owners must obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds their shares prior to voting at the Annual Meeting. 
Via the Internet. You may submit a proxy or voting instructions over the Internet by going to www.proxyvote.com. 
By Telephone. You may submit a proxy or voting instructions by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 and following the instructions.
By Mail. If you received your proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by filling out the proxy card or voting instruction form and sending it back in the envelope provided.
Note that shares represented by properly signed and returned proxies will be voted in accordance with their instructions. In the absence of any instructions, properly signed and returned proxies will be voted in accordance with management's recommendations.
Changing your Vote
You may change your vote at any time prior to the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a new proxy or voting instructions with a later date; 
• providing a written notice of revocation to the Company's Secretary, if you are a registered shareholder; or 
• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person in accordance with the voting procedures outlined above. 
[END TABLE]
Note that beneficial owners must follow their nominee's instructions to revoke their proxies or vote at the Annual Meeting and, for both shareholders of record and beneficial owners, attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request or vote in person at the Annual Meeting. ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
Vote Standard
In order to pass, each proposal must receive a majority of votes properly cast on that proposal. Under current NYSE interpretations, abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast or as expressing any preference. Brokers and other nominees are permitted under NYSE rules to vote on Proposal 3 without obtaining instructions from their beneficial owners.  However, they are not permitted to vote without instruction regarding the election of directors or Proposal 2.
Quorum
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Both abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions
Broker non-votes occur when a broker is not permitted to vote on a matter because a beneficial owner has not provided instructions. These matters are referred to as "non-routine" matters. All of the matters scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are "non-routine," except for the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year 2019. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered voting power present or votes cast with respect to that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Annual Meeting.
Abstentions are considered voting power present at the Annual Meeting but are not considered votes cast and thus will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Annual Meeting.
Additional Matters 
We are not aware of any other business to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If, for any reason, any of the nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board.
Attending the Annual Meeting
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to shareholders as of the close of business on September 17, 2018, whether shares are held in "street name" or are "beneficially owned." In order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you must present:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  a valid photo identification or other satisfactory proof of identification; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.  sufficient proof of ownership or authorization, which may take the form of the proxy card for shareholders of record, a recent brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker for beneficial owners or a letter from a shareholder of record certifying your status as an authorized representative.  
[END TABLE]
 ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
Cameras, including cell phones or other devices with photographic capabilities, and any other video or audio recording devices, are not permitted to be used at the Annual Meeting. Please refrain from use of cell phones at the Annual Meeting as well.
Voting Results
We expect to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish final voting results on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.caci.com. We also expect to disclose the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days of the Annual Meeting.
Householding
We have adopted a procedure, approved by the SEC, called "householding." Under this procedure, we deliver a single copy of the Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials to multiple shareholders at the same address, unless we have previously received contrary instructions from one or more shareholders. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of any of these materials to a shareholder upon written or oral request to: CACI International Inc, 1100 North Glebe Road, Arlington, Virginia 22201, Attn: J. William Koegel, Jr., Corporate Secretary, telephone 703-841-7800. Shareholders can request separate delivery for future meetings in the same manner. Shareholder at the same address who are receiving multiple copies of our proxy materials may contact us using either of these methods to request delivery of a single copy.
Shareholders who hold shares in street name (as described above) may contact their bank, broker or other nominee record holder to request information about householding. 
Solicitation
We will bear the costs of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting and have retained Morrow Sodali, LLC to assist in soliciting proxies at a fee not to exceed $8,500, plus expenses. We may also reimburse banks, brokers, nominees, and other fiduciaries for postage and reasonable clerical expenses incurred by them in forwarding the proxy materials to beneficial holders. Proxies may also be solicited without extra compensation by certain officers, directors and other employees of the Company, by telephone, e-mail, facsimile, personal contact, or by other means.

Proposals for the 2019 Proxy Statement: Shareholders may present proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting by submitting their proposals in writing to the Company's Secretary in a timely manner.
