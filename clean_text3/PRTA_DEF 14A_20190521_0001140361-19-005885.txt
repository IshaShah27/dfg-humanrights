Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker, Bank or Other AgentIf, on the Record Date, your shares were not held in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization, who in turn hold through The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy card from your broker or other agent who is the record holder of the shares, authorizing you to vote at the Annual Meeting.

demonstrated ability to think independently but work collaboratively with other members of the Board and the Company's management. In recommending candidates for election or appointment to the Board, the Committee considers each nominee's or candidate's knowledge, skills and experience, according to the foregoing criteria, as well as his or her independence under Nasdaq and SEC rules. The Committee evaluates each nominee or candidate in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of assembling a group that can best maximize the success of the business and represent shareholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience.While the Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Committee initiated a search earlier this year for a new director and diversity is a top priority of that search.To assist the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in identifying potential directors who meet the criteria and priorities established from time to time and facilitate the evaluation of such potential directors, the Committee may retain third-party search firms, and has retained such a firm for the recently-initiated search for a new director.The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders. For a shareholder to make any nomination for election to the Board at an annual general meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must provide notice to the Company, which notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the Company's registered office (Prothena Corporation plc, 77 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Block C, Grand Canal Docklands,

Our Constitution also specifies further requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder's notice.

As noted above, Irish law provides that shareholders holding 10% or more of the total voting rights can at any time request that the directors call an extraordinary general meeting. The shareholders who wish to request an extraordinary general meeting must deliver to our principal executive office a written notice, signed by the shareholders requesting the meeting and stating the purposes of the meeting.

If our shareholders fail to ratify such appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain KPMG LLP, but may still determine to maintain its appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year 2019. Even if the appointment of KPMG LLP is ratified by our shareholders, the Audit Committee may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.KPMG LLP has audited our financial statements since the year ended December 31, 2012. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

[END TABLE]
Specifically, as of June 1, 2018, 87.7% of our outstanding stock options were underwater, with a weighted-average exercise price of $36.41 per share and individual option exercise prices ranging up to $67.64 per share as compared to the $13.69 per share closing price of our ordinary shares on June 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Committee believed that our employees had a limited opportunity to participate in any future appreciation in the value of our ordinary shares, and that this resulted in outstanding options holding insufficient retention value for our employees, putting us at risk of not being able to retain our most experienced and skilled employees needed to advance our continuing research and development pipeline and provided for insufficient alignment of our employees' interests with those of our shareholders.The Committee therefore approved in June 2018 granting one-time retention stock options to our named executive officers and all of our other continuing employees. Since stock options compensate our named executive officers only if our share price increases after the date of grant and the executive officer remains employed for the periods required for the option to become exercisable, the Committee considered stock options to be the most appropriate and effective retention tool.The other components of executive compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018 were largely consistent with what was provided in prior years.

 What We Do   What We Do Not Do  
     Pay for performance. A significant percentage of total target compensation is pay at-risk that is connected to performance.        No guaranteed annual salary increases or bonuses. Our named executive officers' salary increases are assessed individually, and their annual cash incentives are tied to corporate and individual performance.  
     Strong link between performance measures and strategic objectives. Performance measures for incentive compensation are linked to business priorities designed to create long-term shareholder value.        No tax gross-ups. We do not provide any tax gross-ups to our named executive officers.  
     Independent compensation consultant. The Committee retains an independent compensation consultant to review our executive compensation program and practices.        No perquisites. We do not provide any perquisites or personal benefits to our named executive officers.  
     Annual comparator peer group review. The Committee, in conjunction with our compensation consultant, determines the makeup of our comparator peer group at least annually.        No executive retirement plans. We do not maintain executive or supplemental retirement plans.  
     Long-Term Equity Vesting. All equity awards are subject to four-year vesting.        No repricing permitted. Our equity incentive compensation plan expressly prohibits repricing of equity awards and cash-buyouts of underwater awards.  
     Double-trigger change-in-control severance arrangements. All of our change-in-control severance arrangements have double triggers.        No hedging or pledging permitted. We prohibit our executive officers from engaging in speculative transactions in our ordinary shares, including short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions and other inherently speculative transactions; from entering into any form of hedging or monetization transactions; and from pledging our ordinary shares as collateral for loans.

shareholders on our executive compensation and, in light of the approval by substantially all of our shareholders, did not implement any fundamental or significant changes to our executive compensation programs as a result of the vote.
The Committee Selects a Peer Group. For purposes of their annual compensation assessments and decisions for 2018, the Committee approved a "peer group" of companies to assist the Committee in its review of executive compensation. At the Committee's instruction, Radford used criteria based on (a) industry sector, stage of development and geography (with a focus on biotechnology companies in Phase 3 clinical development that have filed for regulatory approval to market a drug and/or recently received such approval, and companies located in the San Francisco, California area or other biotechnology hub markets that reflect Prothena's talent market), (b) market capitalization between $1 billion and $7 billion (based on the Company's then-market capitalization of approximately $2.4 billion), and (c) number of employees (50-300 employees). These criteria were used to develop a recommended list of peer companies, which Radford presented to the Committee and the Committee then considered, discussed and approved. The only change made to the criteria used for the previous year's peer group was to include companies with larger employee populations. In addition, certain of the peer group companies had been acquired, and other companies' market capitalizations had significantly changed such that they no longer met the Committee's criteria. As a result, Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Aimmune Therapeutics, Array BioPharma, FibroGen, Global Blood Therapeutics and Insmed were added to our peer group; and Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Cempra, MacroGenics, Novavax, Opthotech, Synergy Pharmaceuticals and ZIOPHARM Oncology were removed from our peer group. The peer group companies identified by

These criteria were used to develop a recommended list of peer companies, which Radford presented to the Committee and the Committee then considered, discussed and approved. Under these new criteria, all but one company (Dermira) from the previous peer group were replaced. The peer group companies identified by Radford and considered, discussed and approved by the Committee to assist the Committee in its decisions on special retention awards:

Radford's reports to the Committee included a review of our existing executive compensation programs, practices, levels and arrangements; each executive officer's compensation relative to the market data; and our equity grant practices for all employees (not just executive officers) relative to the market data. Radford's reports also provided recommendations on changes that might be made to our executive compensation programs generally and to each executive officer's compensation. Radford provided its written report in advance of Committee meetings, at which the Radford consultant presented and responded to questions from the Committee.The CEO Makes Recommendations. For fiscal year 2018, Dr. Kinney presented to the Committee his recommendations on compensation for the executive officers other than himself. Following completion of fiscal year 2018, Dr. Kinney provided his assessment of the performance of executive officers other than himself, both in general and with specific reference to the corporate objectives pre-established by the Committee for 2018.

to the pre-established corporate objectives for 2018, as well as on the individual performance of each executive officer other than himself. The Company's Vice President, Human Resources (who is not an executive officer) participated in that Committee meeting, as did the Radford consultant. After receiving that report, the Committee determined the annual cash bonus to be paid to each executive officer other than Dr. Kinney for 2018.After completion of fiscal year 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board completed a review of Dr. Kinney's performance during 2018 (in a meeting with all other independent members of the Board present). The Compensation Committee, with the other independent members of the Board present, also met with the Radford consultant and the Company's Vice President, Human Resources, to discuss Dr. Kinney's compensation. The Committee determined and recommended to the full Board (other than Dr. Kinney) Dr. Kinney's annual cash bonus for 2018 based on attainment of pre-established corporate objectives for 2018. In an executive session without Dr. Kinney present, the Board considered, discussed and approved the bonus amount recommended by the Committee.
and Dr. Zago in the range of 3.2% to 6.0%, which generally maintained them at between the 25th and 50th percentiles as indicated by Radford's market data.In the case of Dr. Kinney and Mr. Nguyen, the Board (with respect to Dr. Kinney) and the Committee (with respect to Mr. Nguyen) determined to not make any change to their respective base salaries for fiscal year 2018, after considering the requests of Dr. Kinney and Mr. Nguyen to not increase their respective salaries. By making no change, Dr. Kinney's base salary fell somewhat below the 25th percentile and Mr. Nguyen's base salary remained at the 50th percentile as indicated by Radford's market data.In connection with Mr. Nguyen's promotion to the additional position of Chief Operating Officer in June 2018, the Committee determined to increase his annual base salary by 3.7%, given his increased responsibilities and after considering Radford's market data (using the new peer group approved by the Committee and listed above), which adjustment resulted in his base salary falling between the 50th and 75th percentiles of that data.Annual Cash Bonuses. Annual cash bonuses are intended principally to motivate executive officers to achieve pre-determined annual operational and financial ("corporate") objectives set by the Committee and the Board to promote achievement of our business strategies and drive increases in shareholder value. The annual cash bonuses for our executive officers other than the CEO depend primarily on the Company's

salary earned in 2018, and the Committee set the other named executive officers' targeted cash bonuses at 40% of their respective base salaries earned in 2018. The maximum cash bonus that could have been earned by the named executive officers was 150% of their respective target bonuses.In setting these target and maximum bonus opportunities, the Committee determined that a higher target bonus opportunity for the CEO, relative to the other executive officers, was appropriate because of the position and responsibilities. The Committee set the bonus opportunities (as a percentage of base salary) for all of the other named executive officers at the same level, determining that the differences in their base salaries were sufficient to distinguish between their relative positions, experience and criticality.In connection with Mr. Nguyen's promotion to Chief Operating Officer in June 2018, the Committee determined to increase his bonus opportunity for 2018 from 40% to 50% (on a pro-rated basis), given his increased responsibilities and after considering Radford's market data (using the new peer group approved by the Committee).Dr. Kinney's annual cash bonus for fiscal year 2018 depended 100% on the Company's performance relative to pre-established corporate objectives established by the Committee (and approved by the Board). The other named executive officers' annual cash bonuses for fiscal year 2018 depended 75% on those same corporate objectives and 25% on their respective individual performance, as determined by the Committee based on assessments by the CEO and the Committee's assessment of each executive officer's individual performance.

and approved by the Board. The actual annual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer for 2018 performance is set forth in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table below.Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Long-term incentives are an important element of our executive compensation that the Committee uses primarily to motivate our executive officers to increase shareholder value and secondarily to retain executive officers. The Committee believes that long-term incentive compensation also encourages our executive officers to identify, pursue and invest in appropriate long-term strategies for increasing shareholder value. Our long-term incentives for fiscal year 2018 were solely in the form of nonqualified stock options awarded under our shareholder-approved Amended and Restated 2012 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "2012 LTIP") and under our shareholder-approved 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "2018 LTIP").We use stock options to link executive officer compensation directly to increases in the price of our ordinary shares, which

     2019 PROXY STATEMENT   33  
[END TABLE]
Black-Scholes values of the stock options awarded to the named executive officers other than Dr. Kinney ranged from slightly below the 50th to above the 75th percentiles as indicated by Radford's market data, which the Committee considered appropriate after taking into account the relative scope and criticality of their respective roles. The grant-date Black-Scholes value of the stock option awarded to Dr. Kinney was at the 50th percentile of Radford's market data, which the Committee (and then the Board) considered appropriate after considering that the Company's share price had recently declined, which had the effect of reducing the Black-Scholes value of Dr. Kinney's award to the 50th percentile.One-Time Retention Awards: As explained above, we undertook a significant reorganization following the discontinuation of our NEOD001 development program. In order to retain our continuing employees and ensure they remain focused on and aligned with our shareholders in advancing our continuing research and development programs, we considered it imperative to grant to all of our employees - including our named executive officers - additional equity awards in the form of stock options. The Committee determined that those awards were necessary and appropriate given the destabilizing effect of our reorganization, the increasingly competitive environment for the kind of highly-skilled and talented employees who are essential to continuing our mission and achieving our goals, and the substantially reduced retention value of stock options previously granted to those executives and employees.In order to determine how best to retain the named executive officers, the Committee instructed Radford to provide data on how other companies in similar situations addressed retention and to propose a new peer group given the substantial changes in the Company's development phase, market capitalization and number of employees (which new peer group is detailed above). The Committee then met with its Radford consultant and considered that market data, as well as the "in-the-money" or "underwater" value (relative to our 30-day average price) of each of our named executive officer's outstanding vested and unvested stock options. The Committee also considered data on typical new-hire awards and the number of shares available and expected to become available for grant under our 2018 LTIP.The Committee placed significant weight on the fact that 100% of outstanding unvested stock options and the majority of outstanding vested stock options held by our named executive officers (and our other continuing employees) were "underwater." In the case of our named executive officers, their outstanding stock options as of June 1, 2018 had a weighted average exercise price of over $33 per share compared to our then 30-day average market price of less

Our named executive officers were eligible to participate in our tax-qualified 401(k) plan on the same terms as all other U.S. employees. The Company makes non-discretionary contributions to the accounts of all participants in the 401(k) plan, and may also make discretionary matching contributions to all participants accounts (which it did for fiscal year 2018, equal to 1.5% of each participants eligible earnings in 2018).Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits. No perquisites or other personal benefits are provided to our named executive officers.
Other Named Executive Officers. Each of Mr. Nguyen, Ms. Karp, Mr. Homan and Dr. Zago are eligible to participate in our Amended and Restated Severance Plan (the Severance Plan), which provides for certain severance payments and benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment. In addition, they have each been awarded stock options containing accelerated vesting provisions in the event of a qualifying termination of employment. The material terms of the Severance Plan and these option agreements, as they relate to certain potential terminations of employment, are described below under the heading Change in Control and Severance Arrangements — Other Named Executive Officers. For the same reasons described above with respect to Dr. Kinney, the Committee considered these arrangements to be necessary in order to secure the services of these named executive officers and an important retention tool that ensures that personal uncertainties do not dilute our executive officers complete focus on promoting shareholder value.In connection with Mr. Homans decision in 2018 to retire from the Company in 2019, we entered into a retirement transition letter with him that provides for, among other things, a payment to Mr. Homan of an amount equal to what would have been his targeted bonus for 2019 based on his actual eligible earnings in 2019, and for any previously-granted stock options that are outstanding and vested on the date of his retirement to remain exercisable for one year from that date, provided that he does not terminate his employment prior to July 1, 2019. The Committee determined that these

any of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer). Prior to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "2017 Tax Reform Act"), compensation deemed to be performance-based in accordance with Section 162(m) was exempt from this $1,000,000 limitation, and compensation paid to the chief financial officer was not subject to the deductibility limitation of Section 162(m). As part of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the ability to rely on this "qualified performance-based compensation" exception was eliminated and the limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all named executive officers, including the chief financial officer. Our LTIP was designed and approved by our shareholders so that incentive compensation under the LTIP may be performance-based in accordance with Section 162(m). However, as a result of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, subject to its "grandfathering" rules, the Company may no longer take a tax deduction for any compensation paid to its named executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 in any tax year beginning on or after January 1, 2018.

Incentive Compensation Plan for the 2019 performance period; however, in exchange for a standard waiver and release, the Company has agreed to pay Mr. Homan an amount equal to what would have been his targeted bonus for 2019 (at his 2018 bonus participation rate of 40%), based on his actual eligible earnings in 2019, provided that he does not terminate his employment prior to July 1, 2019. Any options that are unvested on the date Mr. Homan's employment ends will immediately terminate, and (subject to his execution of the standard waiver and release) any options that are vested on that date will remain outstanding until the one-year anniversary of that date.

programs and their risks to our strategy. Although we periodically review all compensation programs, we focus on the programs with variability of payout, with the ability of a participant to directly affect payout and the controls on participant action and payout. In relation to this, we believe that our incentive compensation arrangements provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond our ability to effectively identify and manage significant risks and are compatible with effective internal controls and our risk management practices. The Compensation Committee monitors our compensation programs on an annual basis and expects to make modifications as necessary to address any changes in our business or risk profile.
We believe that this use of salary or wages earned through the first nine months of 2018 is an appropriate and consistently applied compensation measure for purposes of identifying the "median employee" from a compensation standpoint, because all employees were eligible for annual cash bonuses and received stock option awards in 2018, and the distribution of cash bonuses and option awards were generally consistent with annual base pay. Earnings of our employees outside the U.S. were converted to U.S. dollars using an average currency exchange rate over the nine-month measurement period. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.We then calculated this median employee's total compensation for 2018 using the same methodology used to calculate our CEO's total compensation for 2018, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above. The median employee's total compensation for 2018 included salary, an annual cash bonus paid in 2019 for 2018, stock option awards and Company contributions to that employee's account under our tax-qualified 401(k) defined contribution plan, each calculated for purposes of this pay ratio on the same basis as those same compensation elements of our CEO as explained in footnotes 1, 2 and 3 of the Summary Compensation Table.
