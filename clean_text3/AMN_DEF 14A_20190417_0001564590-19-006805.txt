CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Overview of Our Corporate Governance Program
Our Board and executive leaders are stewards of the interests of our shareholders and believe that strong and effective corporate governance is essential to our success. A cornerstone of our corporate governance program is transparent disclosure to our shareholders on a consistent basis. Our approach integrates all components of effective governance, including a strong ethical culture, a comprehensive enterprise risk management program, an ongoing shareholder engagement program, sound financial, regulatory and legal compliance functions and corporate social responsibility. Our holistic strategy focuses on delivering long-term shareholder value and has been recognized as producing the highest standards of governance. AMN supports and follows the Investor Stewardship Group's ("ISG") Corporate Governance Framework for U.S. Listed Companies. Below is an illustration how certain of our governance practices directly support each of the ISG principles. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ISG Principle  AMN's Practice

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the highlights summarized above, we regularly review, benchmark and update our current corporate governance policies and procedures to ensure best practices. Below are some examples of steps we have taken in an effort to continually evolve our governance program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We engage in a formal shareholder corporate governance outreach program to elicit the views of our investors on corporate governance issues and other related matters. As a foundational element to this program, the Board adopted a policy on shareholder engagement, which we have continued to build on throughout the past three years. 
• We proactively amended our Bylaws to implement "proxy access," which allows a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), for at least three years, to nominate and include in our annual meeting proxy materials, directors constituting the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board. Our market benchmarking efforts and engagement with shareholders in 2016 and 2017 played a significant role in our Board's decision to adopt the proxy access mechanics that it did. 
• We established a formal Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Philosophy and multifaceted Diversity and Inclusion program. 
• We reviewed and revised our Executive Compensation Philosophy to clearly articulate our commitment to equal pay principles and promote of a values-based culture. 
• In 2018, our Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee (the "Governance and Compliance Committee") revised its Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Governance Guidelines") to, among other things, (i) affirm the Board's commitment to a diverse board, (ii) reflect the adoption of broadened and increased equity ownership guidelines applicable to the Company's directors and executive management, and (iii) delineate the Board's responsibilities related to oversight of the Company's Corporate Social Responsibility strategy and related environmental, social and governance practices and risks. A copy of the Governance Guidelines is posted on the Company's website at http://amnhealthcare.investorroom.com/governance-guidelines.  
• In September 2018, we launched a Diversity, Equality & Inclusion web page highlighting our formal philosophy and dedication to fostering and maintaining a diverse team. 
• In September 2018, the Company's CEO Susan Salka and AMN Healthcare joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion initiative. 
• In July 2018, and in response to recent investor insight and an effort to continue to diversify our Board's collective skills and experience to best achieve our long-term strategic objectives, the Company added Daphne Jones to the Board, and her extensive C-suite experience in strategic, entrepreneurial and global use of digital technologies has already made an impact.  
• In February 2019, the Board committed to maintain an average tenure for independent directors of less than ten years, commencing in 2020, in connection with its adoption of a formal Aggregate Tenure Policy. 
• In December 2018, and in an effort to proactively best position itself to oversee the Company's risk management and compliance infrastructure, the Board decided to migrate oversight of all aspects of the Company's ethics and compliance programs (other than oversight of financial compliance and technology security risks) from our Audit Committee to the Corporate Governance Committee, which was then renamed the "Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee" as a result of this transition of responsibilities. We believe that our Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee is best positioned to continue to ensure that the Company continues to deliver long-term shareholder value by identifying and implementing best practices based on its strong history and proactive management of the highest standards of governance and compliance.

Our 2018 Shareholder Outreach Summary
We understand that we must earn and maintain our shareholders' continued support throughout the year by adhering to the highest standards of governance and corporate social responsibility. In 2016, we initiated a formal shareholder corporate governance outreach program to supplement our financial-related outreach and engage our shareholders on governance topics most important to them. Since then, our engagement efforts have evolved into a robust program with a customized approach to each shareholder. We believe this facilitates more meaningful and ongoing dialogue on topics that allow us to work with our shareholders to build stronger relationships and a more successful company.
With a formal outreach strategy and clear objectives in place, we sent letters to over 25 of our top shareholders in August of 2018, representing approximately 70% of our outstanding Common Stock. We appreciate the opportunity to touch base with our shareholders, and we continue to find our meetings to be enlightening and productive. Each shareholder we met with expressed appreciation for our proactive interest in their views, and we certainly appreciated the time they took to share their thoughts with us. Collectively, our discussions centered around the following topics:
Although each shareholder's particular focus was slightly different, our mission, long-term strategy, pay for performance approach to executive compensation and emphasis on corporate governance and social responsibility were well received. One of the focuses of our engagement with a large shareholder is tackling gender pay equality in the U.S. healthcare system, and we look forward to continuing our engagement on this front. Further information surrounding our shareholder engagement program is formalized in our Governance Guidelines and posted on our Company website at www.amnhealthcare.investorroom.com/governance-guidelines. In 2018, we redesigned our website to reflect a modernized style that is simple, more engaging and easier to navigate.
The chart on the following page summarizes some of the specific actions our Board took in 2018 in response to feedback received from shareholders.

Our Culture, Ethics, Engagement and Governance Guidelines
Another essential element that drives our approach to effective corporate governance is our commitment to promoting a culture of ethics and integrity, which guides the manner in which we do business. The Board and executive management are committed to fostering a strong ethical corporate culture and expect all team members to fulfill their responsibilities in accordance with the highest standards of professional and personal conduct.
To uphold this commitment, AMN has adopted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Code of Conduct and Ethics ("Code of Conduct"), that is based on the Company's core values of respect, trust, passion, innovation, customer focus and continuous improvement. The content and format of our Code of Conduct is designed to provide a practical and user-friendly guide for our team members to refer to on a daily basis. It contains examples and questions that help them put our core values into practice. In 2018, we continued to review and refresh our Code of Conduct to reinforce guidance and training on hot topics such as information security and privacy, and highlight our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, and corporate social responsibility. 
• An Annual Ethics and Engagement Survey of our team members. We also share the results of this survey with the Board to ensure we are delivering on the AMN Difference, which includes our core values, leader and coworker quality, collegial work environment, development and career opportunities. 
• A supplementary Code of Ethics for the Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers ("Financial Officers Code of Ethics"). 
• The Governance Guidelines, which function as a critical component to the overall framework for the governance of our Company and was recently revised to reflect the Board's commitment to a diverse board, and 
• Our Executive Compensation Philosophy, which we revised in early 2018 to reflect our commitment to equal pay. 
[END TABLE]
As discussed above, our Board and its committees regularly and carefully review these key governance documents to ensure they contain what we believe to be the best governance practices for the Company. We publish these documents, among others, under the

Our strategy integrates relevant environmental, social and governance ("ESG") criteria to better manage risk and generate sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders, clients, healthcare professionals and team members. Our Board recognizes the integral role that our corporate purpose and culture plays in the Company's long-term success, and we believe our ability to proactively manage relevant risks and opportunities demonstrates the effective leadership and governance principles that long-term investors desire. 
In 2018, we enhanced our human capital management strategy by focusing on diversity and promoting an inclusive culture that respects all voices and reflects our core values. Our multifaceted Diversity, Equality and Inclusion program focuses on the workplace, workforce and marketplace. In 2019, we enhanced the Company's core values to reflect this commitment, because we believe diversity, equality and inclusion should be part of the foundation upon which our core values are built.

Our Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board as a whole is responsible for overseeing our risk exposure as part of determining a business strategy that generates long-term shareholder value. The Board shapes our enterprise-wide risk capacity, appetite and tolerance levels that provide the foundation for our overall business strategy and direction, and believes that overseeing processes for assessing and managing the various risks we face is one of its most important responsibilities to our stakeholders.
Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking in certain areas is important for us to be competitive and to achieve our long-term goals. Our enterprise risk governance framework reflects a collaborative process whereby the Board, executive management and other team members apply a consistent, rigorous approach to our strategic planning and operational decisions across the Company that is designed to balance the opportunities and threats to our business and consider the steps we are willing to take to capitalize on any business opportunities while mitigating against the key risks. The Board believes that oversight of risk management is a vital element of its responsibility. As a result, it meets with executive management at regular Board meetings and, if necessary, at other times to discuss the strategy and success in addressing our identified key risks.
As part of our annual strategic planning process, we maintain an Enterprise Risk Management Committee that assists the Board in identifying key risks. We typically focus on five to seven risks annually, which may relate to, among other things, business operations, competitive landscape, engagement and retention of quality healthcare professionals, talent management, technology systems, security and innovation. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee also assists the Board in determining our risk tolerance in light of our (1) existing risk capacity, (2) appetite, if any, to take on additional risk or lessen our risk, (3) risk velocity and (4) mitigation factors. The Board's determination of our key risks and our tolerance for each ultimately influence how we operate our business, including how we marshal our resources and make strategic and operational decisions.
To ensure that the Company operates within its risk appetite, executive management and other leaders establish and support a culture of integrity, ethical behavior and risk awareness for our team members. We also have designed and maintain internal processes and an internal control environment that further facilitates the identification and management of risks.
In addition to the foregoing, each of the Board's standing committees' responsibilities are designed to focus attention on risk areas implicated by its area of expertise, and each committee reports regularly to the Board on its identification and assessment of such risks. All committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function that typically focus in their areas of expertise. Below is an illustration of which committees, or the full Board, are responsible for overseeing the Company's key risks identified by the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE RISK OVERSIGHT
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities of our compliance with financial ethical requirements and certain other financially-related rules and regulations, as well as our processes to manage our business, financial, technology security and enterprise risk. In performing these functions, the Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent auditor, management, and internal auditors (including in private sessions) to review their work and confirm that they are properly discharging their respective responsibilities.
Among other things, the Audit Committee's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing the work of our independent auditors, 
• Reviewing and discussing with management significant technology strategic initiatives, operations and risks, including, business continuity planning, project performance, technical operations performance, major technology architecture decisions, internal IT controls and related regulatory risks, significant technology investments and trends in technology that may affect the Company's strategic plans, 
• Reviewing and discussing with management key technology strategic initiatives and risks, including information security and cybersecurity incidents and any related disclosure obligations, 
• Reviewing and discussing with management the Company's processes to manage major financial risk exposures to the Company and the steps management has or plans to take to monitor, control and manage such exposures, including our risk assessment and risk management guidelines and policies, 
• Approving procedures for receiving complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and reviewing evidence of material violations of securities laws, breaches of fiduciary duty related to financial reporting and other financially-related disclosures, 
• Reviewing and discussing with management, our chief internal auditor, independent auditors or in-house counsel, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters that could have a significant effect on our financial statements, and 
• Reviewing the results of significant financial or accounting investigations, examinations or reviews performed by regulatory authorities and management's responses. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Company did not identify any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. In addition, the Audit Committee determined that our processes to manage our enterprise, business and financial risks are effective and comply with legal requirements, our policies and ethics.
COMPENSATION AND STOCK PLAN COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT
The Compensation and Stock Plan Committee (the "Compensation Committee") is responsible for analyzing the risks associated with our compensation practices. Among other things, the Compensation Committee's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establishing the Company's executive compensation philosophy and principles, 
• Reviewing on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, evaluate the CEO's performance in light of those goals and objectives, and determine and approve the CEO's compensation level based on this evaluation, 
• Reviewing and make recommendations to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the compensation of all of the Company's executive officers, 
• Setting the composition of the group of peer companies used for comparison of executive compensation, 
• Overseeing the design and management of the various long-term incentive compensation, equity, savings, health and welfare plans that cover our employees, and 
• Reviewing, and recommending to the Board, the compensation for our non-employee directors. 
[END TABLE]
Risk Related to Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee designs our incentive compensation to reward officers and other key employees for committing to and delivering on financial goals that we believe are challenging, yet (i) reasonably achievable, (ii) require revenue and profitability performance to reach the target level, and (iii) require significant revenue and profitability growth to reach the maximum level. The financial performance required to reach the maximum level of compensation is developed within the context of budget planning and, while difficult to achieve, is not viewed to be at such an aggressive level that it would induce bonus-eligible employees to take inappropriate risks that could threaten our financial and operating stability.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has reviewed our material cash incentive plans, which fall into two types: (1) those for front line sales production employees and (2) those for our leadership teams. The front line sales incentive plans typically provide incentives based on monthly or quarterly financial or individual and team operational metrics and include monthly or quarterly payouts. Roughly two-thirds of our sales team members participate in one of our approximately 50 sales incentive plan structures. The leadership plans use annual financial targets based on consolidated and/or division metrics as well as individual leadership and performance considerations with annual payouts. We have internal controls over financial reporting and the measurement and calculation of compensation goals and other financial, operational and compliance policies and practices that are designed to keep these compensation programs from being susceptible to manipulation by any employee, including our named executive officers.
The Compensation Committee considers the risks associated with the compensation plans in light of several factors, including (1) the amount of incentive compensation paid to a particular group as a percentage of total incentive cash paid and as a percentage of division and/or consolidated revenue, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA, (2) the number of plan participants in any particular plan as a percentage of total incentive plan participants, and (3) the amount of target incentive compensation per individual plan participant, which typically ranges from 10% to 80% of total compensation (and can range from approximately 61% to 78% of the named executive officers' total compensation).
The Compensation Committee believes the use of a long-term incentive award program with targets that span a three-year performance period balances risk and reward by discouraging excessive risk that could threaten our long-term value, but at the same time encourages innovation to build our value in the short- and long-term. The Compensation Committee also reviews our program for design features that have been identified by experts as having the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, such as: (A) too much focus on equity, (B) compensation mix overly weighted toward short-term results, (C) highly leveraged payout curves and steep payout cliffs at specific performance levels that could encourage short-term actions to meet payout thresholds, and (D) unreasonable goals or thresholds. After its consideration of the foregoing factors, the Compensation Committee has determined that our compensation programs and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT
The Governance and Compliance Committee considers the risks associated with our corporate governance practices, leadership succession process, ethics and compliance programs, including our healthcare, clinical and employment regulatory compliance practices, and quality programs. Among other things, the Governance and Compliance Committee's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overseeing matters of corporate governance, including preparing and recommending to the Board the Governance Guidelines, 
• Overseeing director succession practices, including identifying potential director candidates for the Board and recommending director nominees to the Board for approval, 
• Reviewing our leadership succession programs and processes and our CEO succession plans, 
• Reviewing the organization, implementation and effectiveness of the Company's non-financial compliance and quality programs, including the Company's employment, healthcare and clinical compliance practices and risk oversight of the credentialing of candidates to ensure that the Company is placing qualified healthcare professionals, 
• Reviewing any significant events investigated under our compliance and ethics programs and the Company's Code of Conduct (other than financial matters or misconduct that are reviewed by the Audit Committee) and 
• Overseeing the Company's shareholder outreach program relating to corporate governance matters. 
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Compliance Committee reviews the Company's practices and approach with respect to corporate governance and regulatory compliance to ensure that its corporate governance and compliance structures provide a foundation for achieving long-term shareholder value. This responsibility goes hand in hand with its oversight of the Company's leadership succession process to not expose the Company to leadership gaps and the consequences flowing from such gaps.

[END TABLE]
The Governance and Compliance Committee also reviews and discusses with our management relevant quality metrics, performance improvement, compliance with certification standards and related laws and regulations as well as our enterprise risk management processes relating to the quality of our services and compliance with regulatory requirements.  The Governance and Compliance Committee believes the Company's sound corporate governance practices, ethics and compliance infrastructure, comprehensive leadership success program and extensive quality programs are designed to shield the Company from risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
Director Independence
The Board has adopted categorical standards for director independence, which we set forth in the Governance Guidelines and make available on our website. Under these standards, a director will not be considered independent if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  the director does not qualify as independent under Rule 303A.02(b) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, 
    (2)  the director or an immediate family member is a partner of, or of counsel to, a law firm that performs substantial legal services for us on a regular basis, or 
    (3)  the director or an immediate family member is a partner, officer or employee of an investment bank or consulting firm that performs substantial services for us on a regular basis for which it receives compensation. 
[END TABLE]
The Board does not consider the following relationships to be material relationships that would impair a director's independence:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  the director or an immediate family member is an executive officer of another company that does business with us and the annual sales to, or purchases from, us are less than 1% of the  
[END TABLE]
annual revenues of the company for which he or she serves as an executive officer,
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (2)  the director or an immediate family member is an executive officer of another company which is indebted to us, or to which we are indebted, and the total amount of either company's indebtedness to the other is less than 1% of the total consolidated assets of the company for which he or she serves as an executive officer and such indebtedness is not past due, or 
    (3)  the director or an immediate family member serves as an officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization, and our discretionary charitable contributions to the organization are less than 1% of its total annual charitable receipts. 
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that director nominees Mark G. Foletta, R. Jeffrey Harris, Dr. Michael M.E. Johns, Martha H. Marsh, Andrew M. Stern, Daphne E. Jones and Douglas D. Wheat meet our categorical standards for director independence and the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE and federal securities laws regarding director independence. Our CEO is the only member of our Board who the Board has not deemed independent.
Board Leadership Structure
We separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Our CEO, Ms. Salka, is responsible for working with the Board in setting our strategic direction and our day-to-day leadership and performance, while the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Wheat, leads the Board in overseeing our strategy, provides guidance to our CEO and presides over meetings of the Board. At this time the Board believes that having separate roles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  increases the independent oversight of the Company and enhances the Board's objective evaluation of our CEO, 
    (2)  provides our CEO with an experienced sounding board in the Chairman, and 
    (3)  provides an independent spokesperson for the Company.

Our Board's Policy on Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions
The Governance Guidelines establish our director's duties to adhere to our Code of Conduct, including our policies on conflicts of interest, and to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with an interest of ours or gives the appearance of a conflict. We require directors to report any potential conflicts of interest immediately to the Chairman of the Governance and Compliance Committee. We do not, without approval of the Board, permit a director or executive officer, or his or her immediate family member (i.e., spouse, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law or anyone (other than a tenant or employee) who shares that person's home) or any other person meeting the definition of "related person" under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (each, a "related person") to enter into a transaction in which we are a participant if (a) the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and (b) the related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. We annually solicit information from directors and executive officers to monitor potential conflicts of interest and comply with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") requirements regarding approval or disclosure of "related person transactions." We did not engage in any transaction in 2018 nor is there any currently proposed transaction that exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in which we were or are a participant and in which a related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
Our Board's Aggregate Tenure Policy
In February 2019, our Board adopted an aggregate board tenure policy that reflects its commitment to consistently evaluate the composition of our Board to ensure that it collectively possesses the necessary experience, skills, knowledge, and level of engagement necessary to serve the best interests of our shareholders.  The terms of the following policy were developed in part based on insight and feedback we received directly from shareholders in connection with our ongoing corporate governance shareholder engagement efforts.
The Board believes that directors should not expect to be re-nominated annually. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the Governance and Compliance Committee considers the needs of the Company and the diversity of the Board as a whole, the director's participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the results of the annual Board evaluation and past meeting attendance.
The Board does not believe in a specific limit for the overall length of time an independent director may serve. Directors who have served on the Board for an extended period can provide valuable insight into the operations and future of the Company based on their experience with, and understanding of, the Company's history, policies, and objectives. The Board also believes that new directors will strengthen the diversity of the Board, provide fresh perspectives and provide value as the Company evolves. To achieve this balance, effective in 2020, the Board will maintain an average Board tenure for independent board directors of less than ten years.  
Board Meetings and Annual Meeting Attendance by Board Members
We expect each of our directors to attend each meeting of the Board and of the committees on which he or she serves. We also expect our directors to attend our annual meetings. Our Board has an excellent record of attendance and engagement. During 2018, the Board met six times, and took two actions by unanimous written consent. In 2018, no member of the Board attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which he or she has been a director) and (ii) the number of meetings held by all committees of the Board (during the periods that he or she served on such committees). All of our then-serving directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Committees of the Board
We have standing Audit, Corporate Governance and Compliance, Compensation and Stock Plan, and Executive Committees. The Board committees are chaired by independent directors, each of whom report to the Board at meetings on the activities and decisions made by their respective committees. The Board makes committee assignments and designates committee chairs based on a director's independence, knowledge and areas of expertise. We believe this structure helps facilitate efficient decision-making and communication among our directors and fosters efficient Board functioning at Board meetings.
In line with our value of continuous improvement, the directors conduct an evaluation of the performance of the Board and each of the committees on an annual basis. Additionally, on a bi-annual basis, the Corporate Governance and Compliance Chairman has individual conversations with the directors specifically regarding their board performance and board composition. We describe the current functions and members of each committee below. A more detailed description of the function, duties and responsibilities of the Audit, Governance and Compliance and Compensation Committees is included in each Committee's charter and available in the link entitled "Corporate Governance" located within the "Investor Relations" tab of our website at www.amnhealthcare.com.

Our Audit Committee Charter, which is reviewed annually and was last amended in December 2018 to reflect the migration of oversight of the Company's ethics and compliance programs from the Audit Committee to the Governance and Compliance Committee, sets forth the duties of the Audit Committee. Generally, the Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things, overseeing our financial reporting process. In the course of performing its functions, the Audit Committee as provided by our Audit Committee Charter:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE
Our Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee Charter, which was recently amended in December 2018 to, among other things, reflect the migration of oversight of the Company's ethics and compliance programs from the Audit Committee to the Governance and Compliance Committee, sets forth the duties of the Governance and Compliance Committee. The Governance and Compliance Committee, which was formally the Corporate Governance Committee, was, at the time of the migration, renamed the Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee. Generally, the Governance and Compliance Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  identifies and recommends qualified individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences to become members of the Board, 
    (2)  periodically evaluates the Code of Conduct and   the Governance Guidelines, 
    (3)  reviews the Board's performance on an annual basis, 
    (4)  oversees all aspects of the Company's ethics and compliance programs, including the Company's healthcare and employment  regulatory compliance and risk oversight with respect to the credentialing of candidates,  
    (5)  reviews and evaluates succession planning for the CEO and other members of our executive management team, 
    (6)  recommends potential successors to the CEO, oversees our shareholder engagement program as it relates to corporate governance issues and considers feedback provided by our shareholders, and 
    (7)  reviews and discusses with our executive team relevant quality metrics, compliance with certification standards and related laws and regulations as well as our enterprise risk management process relating to the quality of our services. 
[END TABLE]
With respect to director nominee procedures, the Governance and Compliance Committee utilizes a broad approach for identification of director nominees and may seek recommendations from our directors, officers or shareholders or it may choose to engage a search firm. In evaluating and determining whether to ultimately recommend a person as a candidate for election as a director, the Governance and Compliance Committee considers the qualifications set forth in our Governance Guidelines, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• judgment, business and management experience, 
• leadership,  
• strategic planning, 
• reputation for honesty and integrity,  
• diversity, and 
• independence from management.  
[END TABLE]
It also takes into account specific characteristics and expertise that it believes will enhance the diversity of knowledge, expertise, experience, background and personal characteristics of the Board. The Governance and Compliance Committee may engage a third party to conduct or assist with the evaluation. Ultimately, the Governance and Compliance Committee seeks to recommend to the Board those nominees whose specific qualities, experience and expertise will augment the current Board's composition and whose past experience evidences that they will (1) dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent performance of Board duties, (2) comply with all duties of care, loyalty and confidentiality applicable to them as directors of publicly traded corporations, and (3) adhere to our Code of Conduct.

Any such recommendation must include the information set forth on Exhibit A to this proxy statement (page A-1). 
The Governance and Compliance Committee received no recommendations for a director nominee from any shareholder for the director election to be held at the Annual Meeting.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The Compensation Committee Charter, last amended in April 2017, sets forth the Committee's duties. Among other things, the Compensation Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  establishes the executive compensation philosophy for the Company, 
    (2)  designs executive compensation programs to attract, incent and retain executive talent, 
    (3)  reviews, and, when appropriate, administers and makes recommendations to the Board regarding (A) compensation of our CEO (including employment agreements or severance arrangements, if applicable, and executive supplemental benefits or perquisites, if any), all senior officers that report directly to our CEO and our directors and (B) our incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans, 
    (4)  prepares the Compensation Committee Report and oversees the preparation of our compensation disclosure and analysis required by the SEC to be included in our annual proxy statement and recommends their inclusion in the annual proxy statement to the Board, 
    (5)  recommends the proposals on "say-on-pay" and the frequency of the "say-on-pay" vote that are required by SEC rules, 
    (6)  reviews our incentive compensation arrangements generally to determine whether they encourage excessive risk-taking, and 
    (7)  evaluates the performance of our CEO. 
[END TABLE]
For further information about the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee, please see the 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 35 below.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The Compensation Committee, whose members are Ms. Marsh, Mr. Harris and Dr. Johns, consists exclusively of non-employee, independent directors, none of whom has a business relationship with us, other than in his or her capacity as director, or has any interlocking relationships with us that are subject to disclosure under the rules of the SEC related to proxy statements.
Compensation Committee Consultant Independence
The Compensation Committee retains an independent consultant to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities. Since 2008, the Compensation Committee has utilized Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. as its compensation consultant. Our compensation consultant advises the Compensation Committee on a variety of topics, including, among others, our equity compensation program, the design of our cash incentive program, the evaluation of the alignment of our compensation program with our shareholders' interests, the risks presented by our executive compensation program structure, the assessment of the program compared to our peers and director and executive compensation trends.
In retaining and utilizing Frederic W. Cook & Co., the Compensation Committee considers (1) our directors' experience with its employees and representatives while serving on other boards, (2) knowledge and experience in executive compensation program design, corporate finance and legal and regulatory issues, (3) experience providing consultative services to boards, as well as its analysis of our existing program and proposal of key considerations in evaluating and strengthening our program and (4) factors affecting independence, including factors set forth by the NYSE for evaluating the independence of advisors. In connection with its consideration of Frederic W. Cook & Co.'s independence, the Compensation Committee factored in that Frederic W. Cook & Co. does provide consulting services to other companies that have a director who is also a director of ours, but it does not have any other relationship with or provide any other services to us. As a result of the Compensation Committee's review of the factors affecting independence, it has determined that Frederic W. Cook & Co. is independent and has no conflicts of interest with us.
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
The Executive Committee exercises the power of the Board in the interval between meetings of the Board, including the approval of certain acquisitions within established parameters.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
[END TABLE]
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
AND OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Members of the Board, who are not employees of the Company ("Independent Directors"), receive compensation for their service in the form of cash and equity. Each form of compensation is evaluated by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. The Compensation Committee believes director pay should be aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders, so it has historically given substantial weight to the equity component, which represented approximately 64% of our Independent Directors median total compensation in 2018. As part of their annual review process, the Compensation Committee evaluates a variety of sources and benchmarks the compensation we pay our Independent Director's against our peer group and relevant market data. It also consults with an independent compensation consulting firm, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., prior to issuing a recommendation to the Board, which it has historically done in April. Following this process provides the Compensation Committee with more visibility into director pay trends based on the most recently disclosed public filings of peer companies included in its analysis. 
Director Cash Compensation
We pay our Independent Directors an annual cash retainer. We do not pay any meeting fees to our directors. The Chairman of the Board, Committee Chairpersons and one Executive Committee member receive an additional annual retainer for their services. We also reimburse directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with their service. Annual retainers are paid in four equal quarterly installments. The table on the right sets forth the current annual retainer schedule for our Independent Directors.

We typically grant full-value equity awards to non-management directors upon appointment or election to the Board, and annually thereafter during the director's term. We anticipate that we will continue to grant annual equity awards to our independent non-management directors at some level for the foreseeable future. Since 2010, the aggregate grant date fair value ("AGD Fair Value") of such equity awards has been approximately $135,000. In 2018, the value was increased by $5,000 to $140,000 to align with the market.
On April 18, 2018, each independent non-management directors received an equity award of 2,153 restricted stock units ("RSUs"). Our director's RSU awards vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the grant date or the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, and each director was given the option to defer receipt of the shares underlying the RSUs until his or her separation of service.

Our Board believes that all directors should maintain a meaningful personal financial stake in the Company to further align their long-term interests with our shareholders. Accordingly, it is the Board's desire that each non-management director will hold Common Stock and vested but unsettled RSUs of the Company equal to a value of at least five times the director's annual cash retainer (i.e., $350,000). The
Company does not take into account the value of unvested RSUs and vested or unvested stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and options in determining whether a director meets our director equity ownership guidelines. As of December 31, 2018, all of our directors, with the exception of Ms. Jones, who was appointed to the Board in July 2018, satisfy our director equity ownership guidelines.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Introduction
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which we refer to as the CD&A, provides a detailed description of the objectives, philosophy, practices and programs that comprise our named executive officers' total rewards program. It also explains how the Compensation Committee determines executive compensation under this program, as it takes great care in the development and refinement of a total rewards program that reflects its stewardship responsibility to AMN's shareholders while simultaneously ensuring the availability of talent to lead our organization to achieve our strategic goals.
More specifically, this CD&A provides clear details related to each of the following aspects of the total rewards program that has been designed for our named executive officers: (1) the objectives and philosophy, (2) the processes and criteria in place for proper oversight, (3) the components of our named executive officers' total rewards program, and (4) how each component fits into our Compensation Committee's overall objective to support the Company's business strategy.
The Compensation Committee believes that our named executive officers are collectively a strong, valuable, experienced, skilled and innovative team, with a passion for the Company, its core values and delivering sustainable, long-term returns for our shareholders.  Our named executive officers for the 2018 fiscal year are listed below.

Executive Summary
Our pay-for-performance focused executive compensation program is designed to motivate our leaders to build sustainable long-term shareholder value. Among other things, the Compensation Committee premises our executive compensation objectives on the following guiding principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to align pay with performance, with variable pay constituting a significant portion of total compensation; 
• to create commonality of interest between our executives and shareholders by tying realized compensation directly to changes in shareholder value; 
• to support the attainment of our short- and long-term financial and strategic objectives; 
• to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and innovative executives who will lead us to be the thought leader and driver of innovation within our industry; and 
• to foster a culture of integrity and ethics where team members are treated with respect and appreciation for their contributions. 
[END TABLE]
To support our objectives, we have designed an executive compensation total rewards program that includes (1) base salary, (2) annual bonuses, and (3) long-term incentive awards, which constitutes a significant portion of our named executive officers total pay.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
Below is a summary relating to our named executive officers' total rewards compensation program.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Do 
 ☑  Executive Compensation Philosophy. We revised our Executive Compensation Philosophy in February 2018 to expressly capture our commitment to equal pay and fostering a culture of ethics. 
 ☑  Align Pay with Performance. We align our executive officers' compensation with actual total shareholder return and financial performance. In 2018, variable pay constituted 78% of our CEO's total compensation and more than 60% of the total compensation for each of our other named executive officers. 
 ☑  Reward for Increases in Shareholder Value. We grant performance restricted stock units, which we refer to as PRSUs in this CD&A, based on absolute and relative total shareholder return over a three-year performance period, which is designed to reward named executive officers for above-market stock performance (relative to companies in the Russell 2000 Index) or hold them accountable for relatively poor stock performance. We refer to these awards based on total shareholder return as TSR PRSUs. 
 ☑  Grant PRSUs that Focus on Our Long-term Goals. We grant performance restricted stock units that payout in accordance with our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin goals, which we refer to as adjusted EBITDA PRSUs in this CD&A. 
 ☑  Ownership Guidelines. We have meaningful stock ownership requirements for our named executive officers that require ownership of unrestricted shares.  
 ☑  Cap Incentive Awards. We maintain a cap on annual bonus awards for our named executive officers under our 2017 Senior Executive Management Incentive Bonus Plan, which we refer to as the Bonus Plan in this CD&A. 
 ☑  Bonus Awards Based on Objective and Key Financial Metrics. 70% of our Bonus Plan target for each named executive officer is based on achieving annual revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets, two key financial metrics for the Company. The remaining 30% is based on objective non-financial criteria such as execution on key initiatives, leadership and demonstration of our values.  
 ☑  Independent Compensation Consultant. Our Compensation Committee utilizes the services of an independent and reputable compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook, to provide recommendations on our named executive officers' pay. 
 ☑  Responsible Share Usage. We judiciously grant shares under The AMN Healthcare 2017 Equity Plan, which we refer to as the Equity Plan in this CD&A, and our share utilization rate under our Equity Plan falls below industry norms. 
 ☑  Appropriate Peer Group Selection. We regularly review our designated peer group to ensure that our compensation program is properly aligned with the actual peers with which we compete for talent and business. 
 ☑  "Double-trigger" Change in Control Provisions. Beginning in 2019, our equity award agreements include a "double-trigger" arrangement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Don't Do 
 ☒  No Risky Programs. We do not engage in compensation programs that create undue risk. 
 ☒  No Pledges or Hedges of, or Liens on, AMN Stock. We prohibit hedging and the pledging of, or hypothecating, or otherwise placing a lien on, any of common stock or other equity interests of the Company. 
 ☒  No Employment Contracts Other than with CEO. We do not provide employment contracts other than for our CEO. 
 ☒  No New Tax Gross-ups. Ms. Salka's employment agreement, which was entered into in 2005 contains a tax gross up. We have committed to not enter into new employment or other agreements with tax gross-ups for named executive officers. 
 ☒  No Options or SARs. We have not granted equity awards in the form of options or stock appreciation rights, which we refer to as SARs, since 2010.

2018 Financial, Operational and Stock Performance Highlights
A long-standing principle of our executive compensation program is to link pay to performance. Accordingly, when making compensation decisions, we analyze our financial, operational and stock performance and execution on strategic initiatives.
As set forth below, the Company delivered revenue, profitability and share growth in 2018(1) and continued to make significant progress on our long-term strategic goals.
Some of our 2018 highlights include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The price of our common stock increased 15% in 2018 to $56.66, the closing price on December 31, 2018.  
• We ranked in the 84th percentile in total shareholder return for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 among companies comprising the Russell 2000 Index as of December 31, 2015 with a cumulative total shareholder return for the last three years (i.e., since December 31, 2015) of 89.8%. 
• Execution of our long-term strategic plan by making two significant acquisitions. In April 2018, we acquired MedPartners HIM, LLC, which we refer to as MedPartners in this CD&A. MedPartners provides case management, clinical documentation improvement, medical coding and registry services to hospitals and physician medical groups nationwide. We also acquired  
  Phillips DiPisa, Inc. and Leaders for Today, LLC, which we collectively refer to as PDA/LFT. PDA/LFT are affiliated companies that identify and place both permanent and interim senior leaders to some of the nation's most influential hospital systems. Collectively, we believe that the acquisitions of MedPartners and PDA/LFT will allow us to continue to diversify and scale our workforce solutions offerings to our clients, strengthening our position as the industry's most trusted workforce solutions provider. 
• Increased our consolidated revenue year over year by approximately 7% from approximately $1.99 billion to approximately $2.14 billion. 
• Increased our consolidated adjusted EBITDA(2) year over year by approximately 5%, from $256.4 million to $270.4 million.   
• Continued to return value to our shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1,236,000 shares of our common stock. 
• Made further progress upgrading and integrating our front and back office technology platforms in order to deliver best-in-class client and healthcare professional experiences and optimize the efficiency of our business operations.  
• Continued execution of our digital and analytical strategic initiatives to improve the recruitment, engagement and retention of healthcare professionals through development of mobile technology platforms and artificial intelligence.

The Compensation Committee placed considerable emphasis on our total shareholder return as well as financial and operational performance over the past 12 months in determining our CEO's 2018 cash bonus as well as her 2018 equity awards. Because certain compensation information included in this proxy statement spans the last three fiscal years, we have set forth below our cumulative total shareholder return and compound annual growth rate for the one-, two- and three-year periods ended December 31, 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Period  Cumulative Total Shareholder Return (1)     Compound Annual Growth Rate     Common Stock Price at Beginning of Period    
    Period  Cumulative Total Shareholder Return (1)     Compound Annual Growth Rate     Common Stock Price at Beginning of Period

    Two-Year Period Ended December 31, 2018  65%     21%     $  38.45    
    Three-Year Period Ended December 31,2018  90%     22%     $  31.05    
[END TABLE]
Numerous factors played a role in our 2018 compensation decisions with the overarching goal of closely linking pay to performance. In 2018, performance-based cash incentives and equity compensation (which is inherently linked to performance) comprised 78% of our CEO's compensation, and 61% - 73% of the total compensation for each of our other named executive officers.
To illustrate this, the chart set forth below reflects the percentage breakdown of our CEO's 2018 compensation as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
[END TABLE]
As the Compensation Committee has consistently done throughout the past several years, it based its 2018 compensation decisions around financial goal setting for 2018 and other actions influencing executive compensation on the expectation that (1) we would achieve targeted revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth on a consolidated basis and within each of our business segments, and (2) our named executive officers would lead their teams to successfully execute our business strategy in a manner that reflected our core values. As a result of our 2018 operational performance and financial results, each named executive officer earned approximately 71% of his or her target bonus that was tied to the Company's 2018 financial performance. On the following page is a breakdown of each of our named executive officer's compensation for 2018.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
Response to 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 18, 2018, we received more than 94% support on our "say-on-pay" proposal regarding the compensation of our named executive officers identified in our 2018 proxy statement. Our compensation program has remained consistent with that set forth in our 2018 proxy statement. We believe the following four themes remain important among our investors: (1) compensation should correlate to company performance, (2) performance awards should constitute an important component of long-term incentive awards, (3) performance measures beyond total shareholder return should be considered, and (4) variable compensation should be designed to motivate, reward and retain executives.
The Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program in 2018 satisfied each of the four themes identified above. In 2018, the Compensation Committee took the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  Continued to use performance restricted stock units tied to total shareholder return and financial goals (i.e., adjusted EBITDA) over a three-year period, 
    (2)  Established goals of 4.9% and 5.1% year-over-year consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, respectively, that we needed to satisfy in order for the named executive officers to receive their target bonuses, 
    (3)  Slightly adjusted base salaries upward to more closely align with industry and peer group pay practices and to reward strong performance,  
    (4)  Slightly adjusted target bonus percentages upward to more closely align with industry and peer group practices, and to more closely tie pay with performance; and 
    (5)  Continued to reward named executive officers for strong financial, operational and common stock performance through the use of reasonable, competitive amounts of incentive based compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Program Philosophy and Objectives
A guiding principle of our Executive Compensation Philosophy is that compensation realized by executives should generally reflect the individual skills and contributions of the executive in achieving the strategic, financial and operational goals of the Company and the leadership they demonstrate in promoting our values-based culture. Additionally, corporate governance best practices, input received from shareholders through our engagement discussions and the annual shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation are also considered in the design of our executives total rewards package. Our philosophy embraces the following principles, which the Compensation Committee sets forth in its Executive Compensation Philosophy, and is available in the "Corporate Governance" section under the "Investor Relations" tab of our Company's website at www.amnhealthcare.com.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-performance, with variable pay constituting a significant portion of total compensation, 
• Create commonality of interest between our executives and shareholders by tying realized compensation directly to changes in shareholder value, 
• Focus on propelling growth in the attainment of our short- and long-term financial and strategic objectives, 
• Reward our executives for long-term improvement in shareholder value, 
• Provide equal pay based on performance without regard to legal status and classification, 
• Attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and innovative executives that embrace and promote AMN's values-based culture that fosters innovation, diversity and inclusion, 
• Build a strong talent base to reinforce our succession plan objectives, 
• Be competitive with companies in our peer group, 
• Maximize the financial efficiency of the overall program from, including but not limited to tax, accounting, and cash flow perspectives, and 
• Ensure that corporate governance practices and the impact of our say-on-pay proposals are upheld.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
[END TABLE]
With these principles as our foundation, we have designed and continually evaluate and modify, as necessary, our executive compensation program to support our strategic objectives of achieving above-market growth in revenue and profitability by (1) being the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services, (2) growing our overall revenue mix from workforce solutions and technology and (3) delivering a superior customer experience through operational excellence and agility.
The primary components of our executive compensation program - (1) base salary, (2) annual cash performance bonuses, and (3) long-term equity incentive awards - reflect the implementation of our executive compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee is provided with benchmarking information of each of these components at the 25th percentile, the median and 75th percentile utilizing companies, including all members of our peer group, that are similar to us in terms of business type, revenue and market capitalization. The Compensation Committee considers benchmarking data as a reference point rather than determinative data. Compensation for specific individuals may vary, sometimes significantly, upward or downward from the median for individual named executive officers based on, among other things, individual performance, tenure, experience, scope of responsibilities, internal parity considerations, the recommendations of our CEO (for compensation other than her own) and succession considerations.
BASE SALARY
We utilize base salary as an essential component of our executive compensation program. We utilize base salary to attract and retain talented executives and to provide them with a fixed base of cash compensation. As set forth below, we analyze a variety of factors in addition to peer group comparative information in setting salaries for our named executive officers.
CASH INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE BONUS
The principles associated with our performance-based compensation reflect a balance of objectives. Our annual cash incentive consists of (1) a financial performance component that we base solely on our annual operational results as measured against certain financial metrics, which we refer to as the Financial Component in this CD&A, and (2) a non-financial component (the "RP/Leadership Component") that is based on, among other things, (A) our performance relative to our direct competitors and (B) individual leadership contributions. We focus the Financial Component on the achievement of financial targets set out in our annual operating plan that we set with the goal of achieving what we believe constitutes above market performance in the healthcare workforce solutions industry. Because we base our annual operating plan on goals related to the execution of our operational and business strategies, the annual cash incentive plan supports the achievement of our strategic goals. The RP/Leadership Component of our annual cash incentive focuses on incentivizing both superior performance over our direct competitors as measured against certain financial metrics, achievement of a significant strategic and operational goals and effective leadership in line with our core values and executive leadership competencies. The Compensation Committee also considers relative and total shareholder return in determining our CEO's award under the RP/Leadership Component.
LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVES
We believe our long-term incentives should consist primarily of equity. We provide such incentives through our Equity Plan, which our shareholders last approved in April 2017. The principles guiding the design of our long-term incentive plans include utilizing long-term incentives to (1) align executive and shareholder interests, (2) enhance focus on improvements in operating performance and the creation of shareholder value, (3) drive achievement of our long-term strategic objectives, (4) support long-term retention of key contributors and (5) retain and motivate potential CEO successors. We also believe that the aggregate cost of long-term incentives should be reasonable in comparison to our peer group, should avoid excessive levels of shareholder value transfer in relation to our peer group and should be reasonable in cost in light of our annual and long-term operating plans.
With the foregoing principles in mind, our long-term incentive plan utilizes three primary vehicles for all named executive officers as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  PRSUs Based on Total Shareholder Return. We utilize TSR PRSUs, the ultimate realizable value that depends on performance against two measures: (1) a relative basis ("Relative TSR") against a broader market (companies in the Russell 2000 Index at the beginning of the performance period) and (2) an absolute total shareholder return basis ("Absolute TSR"). Because our TSR PRSU awards measure Relative TSR and Absolute TSR over a three-year period, we believe this type of award encourages longer-term strategic focus on the creation of shareholder value beyond execution of annual financial targets.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  PRSUs Based on Annual Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Our adjusted EBITDA PRSUs further incentivize our named executive officers to achieve certain adjusted EBITDA margin goals to support our strategic objectives. 
 ✓  Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units. A common equity vehicle we utilize as part of our long-term incentive program to motivate our named executive officers are time-vested restricted stock units that vest ratably over three years, with the ultimate value based on the price of our common stock. In addition to aligning the interests of our named executive officers with shareholders, we also believe these type of awards operate as a necessary and effective retention tool, which is consistent with our compensation principles and a common practice among our peers. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Program Oversight
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The primary responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include oversight of our executive compensation programs. Specifically, they include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• determining the compensation of our CEO and, in partnership with our CEO, establishing the compensation of all other executive officers, including salary, cash incentives and equity awards, 
• designing our incentive compensation programs and administering our Equity Plan and Bonus Plan, 
• establishing the financial metrics and performance targets under our incentive compensation programs, and 
• as set forth more fully above (see page 24 above), analyzing the risk associated with our compensation practices. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews all components of compensation of the named executive officers and other senior officers that directly report to our CEO on an annual basis and will consider changes at other times if a change in the scope of an officer's responsibilities justifies such consideration. In so doing, the Compensation Committee uses the services of an independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., and considers the analysis and advice of its compensation consultant in discharging its responsibilities. Representatives of Frederic W. Cook & Co. attend Compensation Committee meetings and have direct access to the Compensation Committee members without management involvement. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to hire and terminate its compensation consultant.
The Compensation Committee generally conducts its salary and bonus structure review for a particular year in the last quarter of the previous year or early in the subject year. At that time, the Compensation Committee evaluates compensation by, among other things, reviewing (1) peer benchmarking information relating to financial performance and compensation levels, (2) the individual's performance, duties and experience, (3) analysis and advice from its compensation consultant, (4) our financial and operational performance, and (5) the recommendations of our CEO (who does not provide a recommendation for herself). With respect to our Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee, as the administrator, designates which participants are eligible for an award and determines the performance criteria for the award each year. Prior to or at the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board sets financial targets for our performance. Thereafter, the Compensation Committee sets the range of financial performance and corresponding targets for the named executive officers' cash incentive compensation under the Bonus Plan.
The Compensation Committee may also grant annual equity awards under our Equity Plan. In addition to annual grants, the Compensation Committee has granted equity awards to key employees upon their initial employment, promotion or as special retention awards. To further serve this purpose, the Board adopted our 2014 Employment Inducement Plan under which we may issue up to 200,000 shares of our common stock to certain prospective employees. In the Compensation Committee's discretion, it may authorize our CEO to grant equity awards to non-officer employees within certain individual and aggregate thresholds with the effective date of each such grant generally being the effective date of the grantee's promotion or commencement of employment. The Compensation Committee reviews any awards granted by our CEO.
OUR 2018 PEER GROUP
The duties of the Compensation Committee require specific knowledge regarding the executive compensation market. Accordingly, to understand our position within the marketplace for management talent and to assist the Compensation Committee in making compensation decisions that will help attract and retain a strong management team, the Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AMN HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC.  2019 Proxy Statement  41

[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
[END TABLE]
Committee reviews (1) compensation information for companies comparable in size and industry, (2) our financial performance against our internal financial targets, our designated peer group and the Russell 2000, and (3) internal compensation comparability among senior executives.
Because the Compensation Committee compares our performance against that of our peer group as part of its oversight responsibilities, it must determine our peer group. Indeed, the Compensation Committee believes that one of the most important factors it must consider in ensuring that our compensation program remains competitive, is the proper identification and selection of our peers, as we often compete for executive talent with such peers. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee evaluates and modifies, as appropriate, the members of our peer group annually. We select peers from the healthcare, commercial and professional services industries, and target those companies operating in the healthcare and employment services, healthcare technology and diversified support services sectors. Like us, many of our peers are in both the S&P SmallCap 600 Index and the S&P Composite 1500 Index. Our 2018 peer group as determined by our Compensation Committee was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 OUR 2018 PEER GROUP 
 Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc.     Korn/Ferry International 
 Amedisys, Inc.     LHC Group, Inc. 
 Cross Country Healthcare, Inc.     MEDNAX, Inc. 
 Healthcare Services Group, Inc.     On Assignment, Inc. 
 Huron Consulting Group Inc.     Premier, Inc. 
 Insperity, Inc.     Robert Half International Inc. 
 Kforce, Inc.     TrueBlue, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 peer group ranged from approximately $776 million to $5.8 billion in revenues based on each peer's most recently reported four fiscal quarters, and from approximately $265 million to $6.8 billion in market capitalization. For purposes of comparison, our consolidated revenue for our most recently reported last four fiscal quarters equaled $2.14 billion and our market capitalization as of December 31, 2018 equaled approximately $2.65 billion, placing us sixth in our 2018 peer group for revenue and eighth for market capitalization.
Annually, in July, the Compensation Committee evaluates our peer group for the upcoming year primarily using industry, annual revenue, market capitalization as well as competitors and other companies from whom the Company recruits talents.
During its evaluation, the Compensation Committee removed one company from our 2018 peer group, noting that Huron Consulting Group, Inc.'s revenues and market capitalization were no longer competitive because they fell below the 25th percentile of our 2018 peer group.
In determining an appropriate replacement, the Compensation Committee reviewed (1) our 2018 peer group, (2) peers utilized by Institutional Shareholder Services that were not in our 2018 peer group, (3) peers utilized by Glass Lewis that were not in our 2018 peer group, (4) companies that were not in our 2018 peer group that disclosed us in their proxy statement as part of their peer group, and (5) companies within our GICS code that met Institutional Shareholder Services' recommended revenue and market capitalization band criteria. Based on its evaluation, the Compensation Committee made the following changes to our peer group effective for 2019:

Components of Our Compensation Program
In line with our core value of continuous improvement, we (1) listen to our shareholders, (2) review the latest trends in executive compensation practices, (3) evaluate whether certain pay practices are viewed with disfavor by shareholders or proxy advisory services and (4) review our pay practices to ensure that we have designed and implemented compensation programs that we believe will create value for our shareholders with a balance of short- and long-term incentives. The principal components of our executive compensation program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  base salary, 
    (2)  short-term or annual performance awards in the form of cash bonuses, 
    (3)  long-term incentive awards in the form of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units, 
    (4)  a non-qualified deferred compensation plan as well as benefits generally available to all of our employees, and 
    (5)  for our CEO, an employment agreement with severance provisions and, for our other named executive officers, severance arrangements.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
[END TABLE]
BASE SALARY
Base salary serves as the first component of our executive compensation program. In setting base salaries, the Compensation Committee considers a number of factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  the market salary for similarly situated executives within our peer group and other companies of similar revenue size and market capitalization, 
    (2)  our operational and financial performance, 
    (3)  our stock performance, 
    (4)  individual performance, skills, knowledge, tenure, experience and responsibilities, and 
    (5)  for those who report to her, the recommendations of our CEO. 
[END TABLE]
We manage salary changes to fall within our annual budget. We evaluate our operational and financial performance in light of our annual internal objectives and our annual operating plan, the healthcare staffing industry performance and peer benchmarking data. We evaluate our stock performance against our peer group and the Russell 2000 Index. Our CEO bases her recommendations on the same factors the Compensation Committee considers, and her recommendations are particularly helpful for the Compensation Committee to evaluate the other executive officers' performance, knowledge, skills, experience and responsibilities.
CASH INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE BONUS
Annual cash performance bonus opportunities serve as the second component of our executive compensation program. The Bonus Plan is the mechanism by which the Compensation Committee provides such opportunities. We intend our Bonus Plan to provide a strong incentive for our officers to achieve annual financial objectives that support our strategic objectives. Although certain details of the annual bonus incentive may change from year to year based upon the Compensation Committee's focus, a few key components comprise its general structure, including specific financial goals based on our annual operating plan. The metrics typically include financial measures such as consolidated revenue and consolidated adjusted EBITDA. The Compensation Committee sets threshold, "target" (i.e., 100%) and maximum amounts for bonuses and a weight for each metric that corresponds to the level of achievement we require to trigger a threshold, target or maximum bonus for the named executive officer under such metric.
The threshold level for each metric typically starts at a minimum performance level (e.g., 90% of the targeted consolidated adjusted EBITDA). The maximum bonus typically requires a performance level of 110% to 120% of the target amount for each metric. We have typically used incremental hurdles (usually 1% increments for adjusted EBITDA and one-half percent increments for revenue) of performance between the threshold level and the maximum level that increase the amount of bonus that can be earned on a straight-line basis depending on the hurdle ultimately achieved. A portion of the bonuses has been based on non-financial factors, such as performance relative to direct competition, leadership, achievement of strategic objectives and total shareholder return.
In setting each named executive officer's target bonus, the Compensation Committee evaluates benchmarking data for comparable positions generally and within our peer group, the recommendations of our CEO (except with respect to her target bonus), individual performance, knowledge, experience and responsibilities, and the amount of the potential bonus under various performance scenarios. As with base salary, the Compensation Committee considers these factors in the context of each individual's total cash compensation as well as the total compensation package (i.e., equity and cash) generally.
As set forth in our Executive Compensation Philosophy, the principles governing the annual design include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  the metrics must be tied to key indicators of our success and our annual objectives, 
    (2)  the performance goal must be reasonably achievable and viewed as fair, while at the same time encouraging stretch performance, 
    (3)  the metrics must be simple to understand and can be influenced by the subject executive, 
    (4)  the portion of an individual's target annual cash compensation attributable to target annual bonus should increase with successively higher levels of responsibility, and 
    (5)  payouts should reflect our performance as well as the performance of the subject executive. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may amend the Bonus Plan at any time and may also amend any outstanding award granted under the Bonus Plan, provided it may not amend the Bonus Plan without the approval of our shareholders if the amendment would affect the tax deduction of payments made under it.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Long-term incentives in the form of equity awards serve as the third component of our executive compensation program. Under our Equity Plan, we grant equity awards, with various vesting parameters, typically three years in length, to named executive 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 44  AMN HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC.  2019 Proxy Statement    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
officers and key employees as an incentive to have a long-term perspective in supporting and developing our strategic objectives. We also use them as an employee retention tool. We utilize PRSUs as part of our long-term incentive structure to strengthen the performance-based component of the long-term incentive program. In 2018, we utilized TSR PRSUs and adjusted EBITDA PRSUs for performance-based equity for all of our named executive officers.
In general, we believe long-term equity incentive opportunities should be targeted to approximately the market median so that when combined with base salary and target annual bonus, total compensation falls around the median of market levels.
The following principles govern the design of our long-term incentives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  performance periods should cover multiple years to create balance between short- and long-term objectives, 
    (2)  long-term incentives should function to (a) align executive and shareholder interests, (b) enhance focus on improvements in operating performance and the creation of shareholder value and (c) drive achievement of our long-term strategic objectives, 
    (3)  awards should support long-term retention of key contributors through vesting, 
    (4)  aggregate annual share usage should be carefully managed to avoid excessive levels of shareholder value transfer in relation to those of our peer group, and 
    (5)  the aggregate cost of long-term incentives should be reasonable compared to members of our peer group, and the cost implications should be supported by our annual and longer-term operating plans. 
[END TABLE]
RETIREMENT AND HEALTH PLANS
Retirement plans and other customary employee benefits serve as the fourth component of our executive compensation program. We adopted our 2005 Amended and Restated Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan, which we refer to as the Deferred Compensation Plan in this CD&A, primarily as a result of a market review that indicated that a deferred compensation plan was a significant component of executive compensation. We exclude our named executive officers from participating in our 401(k) plan, primarily to assist us in satisfying discrimination testing performed on our 401(k) plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan serves as the only retirement plan for our management, including our named executive officers. The Deferred Compensation Plan is not intended to be tax qualified. We describe the Deferred Compensation Plan more fully in the section entitled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" below.
We also offer healthcare insurance and other employee benefit programs to our named executive officers, which are generally the same as those programs provided to all eligible employees. We offer these plans to support our objective of attracting and retaining strong talent.
LIMITED PERQUISITES
Consistent with our executive compensation philosophy and our commitment to align pay with performance, we have generally refrained from providing perquisites to our named executive officers. However, over the past 18 months, our CEO and President of Professional Services and Staffing have relocated to Dallas, Texas to provide increased executive leadership to our more than 600 employees located in our Dallas office. In connection with their relocations, the Company agreed to pay Ms. Salka and Mr. Henderson each a monthly housing allowance, which the Compensation Committee will review and evaluate on an annual basis. In 2018, the Company paid $96,000 and $62,769 in housing allowances to our CEO and President of Professional Services and Staffing, respectively.  Ms. Salka's housing stipend ended as of December 31, 2018.
EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS
Severance arrangements serve as the fifth component of our executive compensation program. We are party to an employment agreement with our CEO, which contains severance provisions, and have entered into severance agreements with each member of our CEO Committee, including all of our other named executive officers. We entered into these agreements in support of our objectives regarding attraction and retention of strong management. In determining the appropriate severance levels, we considered survey data, advice from our compensation consultant and the Compensation Committee's experience. We describe the terms of these agreements more fully in the section entitled "Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements" below.

Our 2018 Compensation Program and Results
Our named executive officers' 2018 direct compensation consisted of: (1) a base salary; (2) cash incentive bonus based on performance; (3) long-term equity incentives and (4) certain other additional compensation, such as matching deferred compensation contributions, which typically ranges in the aggregate from 1%-5% of our CEO's total compensation. We discuss each component of our 2018 compensation program for our named executive officers in more detail below.
BASE SALARY
In late 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed annual base salary levels for the named executive officers, and after careful consideration, approved increases effective January 1, 2018 ranging from five to seven percent from the previous year, as set forth in the table immediately to the right. In December 2018, the Compensation Committee considered base salaries of our named executive officers for 2019. In making determinations, the Compensation Committee considers, among other things, peer group benchmarking, individual and company performance.
When benchmarking Ms. Salka's 2018 base salary, it was below the median among other CEOs among our peers.

Target Bonus. In January 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the target bonus level for each named executive officer, which we express as a percentage of annual base salary. After careful consideration of peer group data and other benchmarking information, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain the existing bonus percentage target for Ms. Jackson while increasing the target percentage for Ms. Salka and Messrs. Henderson and Scott.
The table below shows 2018 target bonus information for each named executive officer both in dollar amount and as a percentage of salary together with, for comparative purposes, the same figures for 2017.

Rationale for Annual Bonus Performance Goals. The Compensation Committee has continued to utilize financial, relative performance and leadership goals in its annual incentive bonus program over the last several years, including 2018, for a variety of reasons. It chose revenue because it believes it remains one of the most reliable measurements to evaluate the success of our strategy, entry into new markets and growth in our existing businesses. It also selected revenue because investors focus on revenue growth as a metric when evaluating our performance. The Compensation Committee chose adjusted EBITDA because of its widespread acceptance among management, the Board, shareholders and analysts as a measurement of our profitability and performance. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA (along with net income) are routinely areas of focus during our earnings calls. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee believes adjusted EBITDA is an objective measure of management's performance, and it excludes items over which management has less control, such as amortization, interest expense and taxes. The Compensation Committee uses the RP/Leadership Component to, among other things, distinguish among individuals with respect to non-financial metrics, such as leadership, personal performance, contributions and execution on our strategic and operational initiatives.
The actual consolidated revenue and consolidated adjusted EBITDA targets that the Compensation Committee originally established as the basis for paying the Financial Component of the 2018 bonuses required the Company to reach the 100% target level and represented growth that the Compensation Committee believed was at or above organic growth rates in the markets we serve. The threshold for a named executive officer to receive a bonus on the consolidated financial metrics required achievement of 90% of our 2018 annual operating plan target for each of pre-bonus adjusted EBITDA,(3) which we refer to as Pre-Bonus AEBITDA, and consolidated revenue. For information on the calculation of Pre-Bonus AEBITDA, and a reconciliation of it to our 2018 net income, please see Exhibit B to this proxy statement (page B-1). Receipt of the target bonus amount for each financial metric required the Company to meet 100% of our 2018 annual operating plan for that metric, which represented roughly 5% year-over-year growth for both consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA.
2018 Bonus Plan Payouts. The 2018 annual operating plan did not reflect the potential financial impact of any acquisitions. The Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to add the incremental contribution that the MedPartners and PDA/LFT acquisitions were projected to have, at the time of acquisition (i.e., April 2018), to the Company's bonus plan revenue and adjusted EBITDA target. This approach reflected the Compensation Committee's recognition that the expansion of our workforce solutions through acquisition is a key component of our growth strategy. It also served to increase the revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets in order for our named executive officers to receive their targeted bonus.
We have included a table below ($ in thousands) that summarizes how we performed against the target financial performance metrics that we utilized (i.e., the Company's annual operating plan plus the estimated revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization contributions of the acquisitions) when determining the Financial Component portion of our named executive officers' bonuses for 2018.

Additionally, we (i) successfully acquired and integrated MedPartners and PDA/LFT, which furthered our strategic goal of expanding our workforce solutions offerings, (ii) entered into a new $400 million secured revolving credit facility that provides us with additional liquidity on what we believe are favorable terms to pursue strategic acquisitions, and continued to expand the breadth of strategic partnerships with some of our largest clients, and (iii) continued our strategic development of mobile technology platforms and artificial intelligence aimed at improving the recruitment, engagement and retention of healthcare professionals.
Finally, recognizing that the future poses additional challenges that are distinct from the past, we completed our implementation of new front and back office enterprise information technology systems within our locum tenens segment, which we believe will more effectively align us with clients, healthcare professionals and our other business lines.

If we conducted the TSR Measurement on December 31, 2018: (1) Relative TSR would have measured at the 81st percentile, and (2) Absolute TSR would have been positive. Based on those results, 175% of our named executive officers' target number of TSR PRSUs granted in 2018 would have been earned. The table set forth below discloses the percentage of the 2018 target PRSUs that may be earned depending on the actual results of the Company's TSR Measurement as of December 31, 2020.(4)

 (1)  For each one percentile above the 25th percentile, an additional 3% of the TSR PRSUs will be earned if Absolute TSR is positive, and the maximum payout cannot exceed 175%. If Absolute TSR is negative, for each one percentile above the 25th percentile, an additional 1.5% of the TSR PRSUs will be earned up to the 50th percentile with the maximum payout of 100%.

Adjusted EBITDA PRSUs
In 2018, the Compensation Committee once again determined it best to dedicate a significant portion of the preferred restricted stock units to focus our named executive officers on achieving a 13.8% adjusted EBITDA margin for 2020.(5) The number of shares that could ultimately be earned ranges from 0% to 200% of the target number of adjusted EBITDA PRSUs depending on actual adjusted EBITDA margin performance for 2020.
Time-Vested RSUs
Beginning with grants in January 2018, restricted stock unit grants, which we refer to as RSUs, vest ratably on the anniversary of the grant date over a three-year period. In addition, in December 2018 our Compensation Committee approved changes to our RSU agreements for grants to our named executive officers beginning at that time to (1) provide for "double trigger" vesting mechanics in the event of a change in control of the Company, and (2) allow for continued vesting of outstanding equity awards if a grantee terminates his or her employment at a time that he or she satisfies certain age and service time requirements, which the agreements refer to as "retirement." 
As it has done historically, the Compensation Committee elected to wait to consider a grant of RSUs for Ms. Salka for 2018 until the end of 2018 when it had better visibility of our year-end financial, operational and stock performance. Based on our strong financial, operational and stock performance in 2018, the Compensation Committee granted Ms. Salka 22,187 RSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $1,250,016 on December 17, 2018. This RSU grant to Ms. Salka contained the modifications described in the above paragraph. We anticipate that, commencing in October 2019, Ms. Salka will satisfy the requirements for retirement eligibility under this RSU award.
Aggregate Grant Date Fair Value
PRSUs represented 65% of the AGD Fair Value of all 2018 equity awards for our named executive officers, other than our CEO. Due to the timing of Ms. Salka's RSU award in December 2018 (rather than January 2018), she received PRSUs that represented 57% of her total 2018 equity award value. To provide further clarity on our equity compensation practices, the chart set forth below details the change of the AGD Fair Value of all 2018 equity awards granted to our named executive officers against the AGD Fair Value of all 2017 equity awards.
The 26% increase in our CEO's AGD Fair Value in 2018 from 2017 is driven in part by the Company's strong financial, operational and stock performance in 2018, as well as peer group and other compensation benchmarking. We believe that the AGD Fair Value of her equity awards placed her below the median among CEOs within our 2018 peer group for long-term incentive compensation. On an aggregate basis, the combined AGD Fair Value of our named executive officers' equity awards increased 29% in 2018 from 2017.
(4) As set forth in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table, the target number of TSR PRSUs granted in 2018 for each named executive officer is as follows: (1) for Ms. Salka, 11,528; (2) for Mr. Scott, 4,575; (3) for Mr. Henderson, 4,575; and (4) for Ms. Jackson, 1,967.
(5) As set forth in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table, the target number of adjusted EBITDA PRSUs granted in 2018 for each named executive officer is as follows: (1) for Ms. Salka, 17,927; (2) for Mr. Scott, 7,114; (3) for Mr. Henderson, 7,114; and (4) for Ms. Jackson, 3,059.

2016 Adjusted EBITDA PRSU Award Measurement
On February 19, 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that our 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin equaled 12.67%. Accordingly, each named executive officer received 77.5% of his or her target amount of 2016 adjusted EBITDA PRSUs. Specifically, Ms. Salka, Mr. Scott, Mr. Henderson and Ms. Jackson earned 15,729, 9,437, 9,437 and 23,594 PRSUs under their 2016 adjusted EBITDA PRSU awards, respectively.
ACTUAL CEO PAY
The difference between actual pay and the grant date valuation of our long-term incentive vehicles can be significant. Given the substantial portion of our CEO's compensation that is performance based, we believe it is critical to consider actual pay together with the performance of our Company's common stock price. We recognize that companies and proxy advisory firms have used various methodologies to calculate actual and realizable compensation, so the following chart illustrates our CEO's pay over the past three years as follows: (1) her target total direct pay as determined by the Compensation Committee, (2) her total pay as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and (3) her "Actual Pay" based on the SEC's proposed pay versus performance disclosure rule, which we refer to as the Actual Pay Proposed Rule in this CD&A. 
As illustrated in the CEO Pay chart on the following page, our annual and long-term incentive programs over the past three fiscal years are consistent with our pay-for-performance-centric executive compensation philosophy, which is that actual pay is significantly correlated to the performance of our common stock. For the one-, two- and three-year periods ended December 31, 2018, respectively, we were at the 81st, 85th and 84th percentile for cumulative total shareholder return against the companies comprising the Russell 2000 Index. Common stock performance also provided cumulative total shareholder returns of 23%, 65% and 90% for the one-, two- and three-year periods ended December 31, 2018, respectively. In turn, our CEO's actual pay exceeded her annual target total direct compensation for each of the past three years, which is consistent with our design to pay above target compensation when our Company operates at a high level and provides significant total shareholder return.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)  Under the SEC's Actual Pay Proposed Rule, as applicable to our CEO's components of compensation for the years set forth in the table, actual pay equals the total compensation set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for the covered year adjusted as follows: (A) we deduct the value of stock awards and options awards set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for the covered year and (B) we add the fair value on the vesting date of all stock awards and option awards for which all applicable vesting conditions were satisfied during the covered fiscal year. For awards that vested on a certain date, but did not actually settle until it was established whether the conditions for acceleration had been met or the applicable performance test had been certified, the table reflects the value of such shares during the year of vesting but utilizes the fair market value on the date the awards were certified, which usually is in February and approximately two weeks to two months after the vesting date. Any awards deferred by Ms. Salka under our Deferred Compensation Plan are reflected in our calculations. 
 (2)  For purposes of calculating target pay, this chart utilizes Ms. Salka's target bonus and target equity values preliminarily established by the Compensation Committee for the applicable year, which typically occurs in early January of the subject year or in December prior to the subject year. With respect to the equity target, the amount ultimately granted may vary from what the Compensation Committee actually targeted due to, among other things, the timing of the grant of her RSU equity award.

Equity Ownership Requirements, Clawback and No Pledging Policies
We maintain meaningful equity ownership requirements as well as clawback and pledging policies to which our named executive officers are subject. We have set forth a summary of these requirements and policies below. Additional details are contained in the Governance Guidelines.
EQUITY OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
The Board believes that all named executive officers should maintain a meaningful personal financial stake in the Company to align their long-term interests with those of our shareholders. Accordingly, in 2018 we broadened the applicability and increased our equity ownership requirements to reflect the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Equity Ownership Requirements 
 Level  Proposed 
 Board of Directors  5x Annual Cash Retainer  
 Chief Executive Officer  5x Base Salary  
 Named Executive Officers  2x Base Salary  
 Other CEO Committee Members  1.5x Base Salary

[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
The value of unvested RSUs and vested or unvested SARs and options are not taken into account in determining whether a named executive officer satisfies our equity ownership requirements. Individuals subject to the equity ownership requirements above who have not met the applicable ownership requirements are required to retain 50% of net vested shares from equity awards issued subsequent to the initial assessment of ownership until they have reached the applicable ownership requirement. As of the close of business on February 20, 2019, all of our named executive officers satisfy our equity ownership requirements.
CLAWBACK POLICY
Under the Governance Guidelines, if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws caused by misconduct, we can seek recoupment from all of our current or former executive officers who participated in the misconduct of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  all or any portion of the bonus and equity or cash incentive compensation received by such individuals during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever first occurs) of the financial document embodying such defective financial statement; and 
    (2)  any profits realized by such individuals from the sale of securities of the Company during that 12-month period. 
[END TABLE]
NO PLEDGING POLICY
The Governance Guidelines prohibit named executive officers (and directors) from pledging, hypothecating or otherwise placing a lien on any shares of our common stock (or any other equity interests) that they own.
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Prior to December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") was signed into law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") generally disallowed a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million per officer in any year that did not qualify as performance-based. 
Under the TCJA, the performance-based exception has been repealed and the $1 million deduction limit now applies to anyone serving as the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and the top three other highest compensated executive officers serving at fiscal year end. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date.
Overview of Our 2019 Executive Compensation Program
Overall, the Compensation Committee believes the Company performed well during 2018. We achieved year-over-year consolidated revenue and consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 7% and 5%, respectively. Performance of our common stock continued its strong performance in 2018, delivering a 15% price appreciation. In light of the foregoing and with its guiding principles in mind, the Compensation Committee believes it has designed the 2019 compensation structure to provide for important short- and long-term performance components that are aligned with shareholders, consistent with the market environment and tailored specifically to us.
BASE SALARY
The Compensation Committee approved increases in the annual base salaries for the named executive officers for 2019 to maintain a pay for performance alignment, as follows:

BONUS PLAN
Target Bonus. In January 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed the target bonus level for each named executive officer, which we express as a percent of annual base salary.  After careful consideration, and based on peer group and other benchmarking data, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2019 bonus target as a percentage of salary should be increased for Ms. Jackson based on market data and performance. We set forth below the 2019 target bonuses for each named executive officer as a percentage of salary together with, for comparative purposes, the same figures for 2018.

LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVES
To align with their philosophy, goals and objectives surrounding long-term incentive awards, the Compensation Committee continued to utilize a combination of (1) TSR PRSUs, (2) adjusted EBITDA PRSUs, and (3) time-vested RSUs, to strike the balance necessary to achieve its aim. 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee continued to target an allocation of 30% TSR PRSUs, 35% adjusted EBITDA PRSUs and 35% time-vested RSUs (as a percentage of the AGD Fair Value of all 2019 equity awards). For each named executive officer, other than Ms. Salka, approximately 65% of the AGD Fair Value of the January 2019 equity awards consisted of PRSUs, and the remaining 35% consisted of time-vested RSUs; for Ms. Salka, all of her January 2019 equity awards were PRSUs, as the Compensation Committee will make their decision on her equity grant of time-vested RSUs in the fourth quarter of 2019 when it has better visibility of the Company's 2019 performance.

 (4)  These PRSUs vested on January 5, 2019. 
 (5)  The Compensation Committee performed the TSR Measurement for this award for the measurement period ended December 31, 2018 on January 3, 2019. Relative TSR measured at the 84th percentile and Absolute TSR was positive. Based on those results, the number of PRSUs set forth in this column for this award, which was the maximum amount that could have been received under the award, vested on January 5, 2019. 
 (6)  The AEBITDA PRSUs underlying this award vested on January 5, 2019 and settled on February 19, 2019 when the Compensation Committee determined the Company's 2018 AEBITDA margin. 
 (7)  Because the number of shares earned under this award was based on the Company's 2018 AEBITDA margin, we set forth the number of shares actually earned. Based on the Company's 2018 AEBITDA margin of 12.7%, 77.5% of the target amount for this award was awarded. 
 (8)  The RSUs underlying this award vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to certain accelerated vesting if we were to achieve our AEBITDA targets in 2017 or 2018. We achieved our 2017 AEBITDA target, and, as a result 33% of the RSUs vested on January 5, 2017 (and are not reflected as unvested in this row). We also achieved our 2018 AEBITDA target; accordingly 34% of the original number of RSUs comprising the award vested on the second anniversary of the grant date but did not settle until February 19, 2019, when it was determined that the conditions to acceleration had been met. For purposes hereof, we reflect such shares as vested and do not include them in this row. The remaining unvested amount set forth in this row will vest on December 5, 2019. 
 (9)  The TSR PRSUs underlying this award vest on the date on which the Compensation Committee performs the TSR Measurement, which shall occur within 30 days after December 31, 2019. We describe the TSR Measurement in detail in the CD&A section above. 
 (10)  The ultimate number of TSR PRSUs that vest under this award depends on the results of the TSR Measurement. The target amount for each of Ms. Salka, Mr. Scott, Mr. Henderson and Ms. Jackson for his or her equity incentive plan award granted on January 4, 2017 is 11,829, 4,140, 4,140 and 2,424, respectively. For the target amount of TSR PRSUs to be earned, Relative TSR under the TSR Measurement would need to equal the 50th percentile and Absolute TSR would have to exceed zero. The range of TSR PRSUs that may be earned by the identified named executive officer under this award is zero to an amount equal to the product of (1) the target amount for such executive, multiplied by (2) 1.75. The threshold amount equals 12.5% of the target amount. If we were to have conducted the TSR Measurement on December 31, 2018 (1) Relative TSR would have measured at the 71st percentile, and (2) Absolute TSR would have been positive. Based on those results, TSR PRSUs equal to 175% of the target amount (i.e., 20,701, 7,245, 7,245 and 4,242 for Ms. Salka, Mr. Scott, Mr. Henderson and Ms. Jackson, respectively) would have been earned. 
 (11)  The AEBITDA PRSUs underlying this award vest on January 4, 2020. The settlement date and the determination of the amount of shares actually vested under the award reflected in this row will take place when the Compensation Committee determines our 2019 AEBITDA margin, which we believe will occur in February 2020. 
 (12)  Pursuant to the instructions set forth to Item 402(f)(2) of Regulation S-K, which provides that the number of shares reported in this column shall be based on achieving target performance goals because our 2018 AEBITDA margin of 12.7% exceeds the 2019 threshold AEBITDA margin of 12.5% but falls below the target AEBITDA margin of 13.5%, we set forth the number of shares representing the target amount for the award in this column. 
 (13)  The RSUs underlying this award vest in three tranches on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date and the Grantee's provision of three periods of Credited Service, but are still reflected on this table as unvested because they remained unvested as of December 31, 2018. 
 (14)  The TSR PRSUs underlying this award vest on the date on which the Compensation Committee performs the TSR Measurement, which shall occur within 30 days after December 31, 2020. We describe the TSR Measurement in detail in the CD&A section above. 
 (15)  The ultimate number of TSR PRSUs that vest under this award depends on the results of the TSR Measurement. The target amount for each of Ms. Salka, Mr. Scott, Mr. Henderson and Ms. Jackson for his or her equity incentive plan award granted on January 5, 2018 is 11,528, 4,575, 4,575 and 2,424, respectively. For the target amount of TSR PRSUs to be earned, Relative TSR under the TSR Measurement would need to equal the 50th percentile. The range of TSR PRSUs that may be earned by the identified named executive officer under this award is zero up to an amount equal to the product of (1) the target amount for such executive, multiplied by (2) 1.75. The threshold amount equals 25% of the target amount. If we were to have conducted the TSR Measurement on December 31, 2018, Relative TSR would have measured at the 81st percentile. Based on those results, TSR PRSUs equal to 175% of the target amount (i.e., 20,174, 8,006, 8,006 and 4,242 for Ms. Salka, Mr. Scott, Mr. Henderson and Ms. Jackson, respectively) would have been earned. 
 (16)  The AEBITDA PRSUs underlying this award vest on January 5, 2021. The settlement date and the determination of the amount of shares actually vested will take place when the Compensation Committee determines our 2020 AEBITDA margin, which we believe will occur in February 2021. 
 (17)  Pursuant to the instructions set forth to Item 402(f)(2) of Regulation S-K, which provides that the number of shares reported in this column shall be based on achieving the threshold performance goal because our 2018 AEBITDA margin of 12.7% does not exceed the 2020 threshold AEBITDA margin of 12.8%, we set forth the number of shares representing the threshold amount for the award. 
 (18)  The RSUs underlying this award vest in three tranches on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Grant Date and the Grantee's provision of three periods of Credited Service, but are still reflected on this table as unvested because they remained unvested as of December 31, 2018. 
 (19)  The RSUs underlying this grant settled on January 5, 2019. 
 (20)  The RSUs underlying this award vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to certain accelerated vesting if we were to achieve our AEBITDA targets in 2017 and 2018. We achieved our 2017 AEBITDA target, and, as a result 33% of the RSUs vested on February 5, 2018 (and are not reflected as unvested in this row). We also achieved our 2018 AEBITDA target; accordingly 34% of the original number of RSUs comprising the award vested on the second anniversary of the grant date but did not settle until February 19, 2019, when it was determined that the conditions to acceleration had been met. 
 (21)  The RSUs underlying this award settled on January 5, 2019. 
 (22)  This row reflects a grant that had time-based and performance-based components pursuant to which 19,243 shares of our Common Stock will settle on January 5, 2019, and an additional 19,243 shares also settled on such date since the average closing price of our Common Stock during December 2018 exceeded $29.20 per share. Pursuant to the instructions set forth to Item 402(f)(2) of Regulation S-K, which provides that the number of shares reported in this column shall be based on achieving target performance goals (which includes both components) because the average closing price of our Common Stock during December 2018 exceeded the $29.20 per share Common Stock price target that must be met in December 2018 to receive the target amount, we set forth the number of shares representing the target amount for the award in this column.

We adopted and maintain our Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides our executives, including our named executive officers, with the opportunity to defer up to 80% of their base salary and up to 90% of their bonus. The Deferred Compensation Plan also permits executives to defer the settlement date of their RSUs or PRSUs. Our named executive officers are excluded from participating in our 401(k) plan. In 2018, we matched up to 50% of the first 6% and 100% of the next 4% of the executive's eligible compensation for a maximum match of 7% of the executive's cash compensation. The Deferred Compensation Plan credits deferrals (other than deferrals of RSUs or PRSUs) with earnings or losses based upon the executive's selection of 12 publicly traded mutual funds, which may change from time to time. The measurement funds are: Vanguard VIF Total Bond Market Index, Fidelity VIP Investment Grade Bond, PIMCO VIT Real Return Portfolio, MFS VIT Value, Dreyfus Stock Index, American Funds IS Growth, JPMorgan IT Mid Cap Value, Janus Henderson VIT Enterprise, DFA VA U.S. Targeted Value, Vanguard VIF Small Company Growth, American Funds IS International and NVIT Government Money Market.
Executives may change their election of measurement funds on a daily basis. Additionally, beginning in 2014, the Deferred Compensation Plan permitted executives to invest in a Deferred Compensation Fixed Rate Fund, which provides an annual fixed rate of return that is generally set by the Company on January 1 of each year at 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate. For 2018, the Company set the rate of return at 3.1% per annum. In 2019, the Company changed the rate of return to 3.9% per annum.
Benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan are payable in a lump sum or in annual installments for a period of up to ten years beginning six months after the named executive officer's separation from service. Executives may also select at the time of deferral to be paid upon a change in control or a fixed distribution date, which must be at least two years after the date of deferral. Benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan are also payable if the executive experiences an unforeseen financial emergency. Deferrals of RSUs or PRSUs are settled in shares upon a fixed date selected by the executive or upon a separation from service or change in control.
The following table reflects contributions made by the named executive officers and matching contributions made by us under the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal year 2018 as well as the named executive officers' aggregate earnings, withdrawals and balance information.

Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements
MS. SALKA'S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
We are party to an employment agreement with Ms. Salka dated May 4, 2005, as amended February 6, 2008. The employment agreement provides that Ms. Salka will serve as our President and CEO. For her services in that capacity, Ms. Salka (1) receives a base salary that we may increase annually at our discretion, (2) is eligible to receive an annual bonus subject to meeting certain performance-based criteria, and (3) is eligible to participate in our equity plans, employee benefit plans and other benefits programs provided in the same manner and to the same extent as our other senior management. The term of Ms. Salka's employment agreement ends May 4, 2020 and automatically renews unless a party gives notice 120 days prior to the expiration date that such party does not wish to extend the term of the employment agreement.
The employment agreement provides that Ms. Salka will receive severance benefits under the following three circumstances:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  Death or Disability. In the event of her disability or death, Ms. Salka or her estate, as applicable, would be entitled to a severance payment equal to the sum of (A) two times her then-current annual base salary (payable not later than 30 days following termination of employment), and (B) an amount equal to the average of bonuses earned for the three most recent fiscal years  
     ("Average Bonus") by her (payable when bonuses are paid to our other executive officers). 
    (2)  Termination for Reason Other than for Cause or Resignation for Good Reason. If we terminate Ms. Salka's employment for any reason other than for "cause," (7) or if she terminates her employment for "good reason," (8) Ms. Salka would be entitled to receive from us, not later than 30 days following termination of employment, a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (A) two times her then-current annual base salary, and (B) two times her Average Bonus. 
    (3)  Change in Control. If, within one year following a "change in control," (9) we terminate Ms. Salka for any reason other than for cause, or if she terminates her employment for good reason, she would be entitled to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable following her termination, a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (A) three times her then-current annual base salary, and (B) three times her Average Bonus. In addition, any unvested shares of RSUs, PRSUs, unvested options or other equity-based compensation awards held by Ms. Salka would automatically become 100% vested upon any "change in control" (as defined in Ms. Salka's equity award agreements and the Equity Plan).

Additionally, under each of the above scenarios, Ms. Salka and her eligible dependents are entitled to continue to participate for two years in our medical, life, dental and disability insurance plans to the extent such plans permit continued participation (with Ms. Salka continuing to pay premiums in respect of such coverage that she was paying prior to termination).
Under some circumstances, amounts payable under Ms. Salka's employment agreement are subject to a full "gross-up" payment to make her whole if she is deemed to have received "excess parachute payments" under Section 4999 of the Code. The employment agreement has not been amended in recent years; however, in 2009, we committed to cease entering into employment agreements with tax gross-ups. Payment of all or a portion of the amounts set forth above may be delayed six months following her termination, if necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The employment agreement requires Ms. Salka to release any claims against us. The employment agreement also contains a confidentiality provision and a provision requiring Ms. Salka not to solicit our employees during its term and for a period of two years thereafter.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (7)  "Cause" is defined in the employment agreement as a termination of employment by us due to Ms. Salka's (i) commission of an act of fraud or embezzlement against us or any of our subsidiaries or conviction in a court of law, or guilty plea or no contest plea, of any charge involving an act of fraud or embezzlement; (ii) conviction in a court of law, or guilty plea or no contest plea, to a felony charge; (iii) willful misconduct as our employee or as an employee for any of our subsidiaries that is reasonably likely to result in injury or financial loss to us or our subsidiaries; (iv) willful failure to render services to us or any of our subsidiaries in accordance with her employment duties, which amounts to a material neglect of duties to us and does not result from physical illness, injury or incapacity, and which failure is not cured promptly after adequate notice; or (v) material breach of certain covenants of the employment agreement, if not cured within 30 days after written notice. 
 (8)  "Good Reason" is defined in the employment agreement as (i) a material breach by us of the employment agreement with the exception of certain provisions thereto not cured within 30 days after the Board's receipt of written notice of such non-compliance; (ii) the assignment to Ms. Salka without her consent of duties materially and adversely inconsistent with her position, duties or responsibilities, or a change in her title or office, or any removal of her from any of such positions, titles or offices, or any failure to elect or reelect her as a member of the Board or any removal of her as such a member, subject to certain exceptions; or (iii) the relocation of our corporate headquarters from San Diego, California of more than 50 miles without her approval. 
 (9)  "Change in control" is defined in the employment agreement as occurring upon: (1) the acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a majority of the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; (2) our dissolution or liquidation; (3) the sale of all or substantially all of our business or assets; or (4) the consummation of a merger, consolidation or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Company that requires the approval of our shareholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), if immediately following such Business Combination: (x) a Person is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation), or (y) our shareholders cease to beneficially own, directly or indirectly, in substantially the same proportion as they owned the then outstanding voting securities immediately prior to the Business Combination, a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation). "Surviving Corporation" means the corporation resulting from a Business Combination, and "Parent Corporation" means the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the Surviving Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS
As of December 31, 2018, we were party to executive severance agreements with (1) Ms. Jackson, dated May 4, 2005, as amended on March 8, 2006 and February 6, 2008, (2) Mr. Henderson, dated September 4, 2007, as amended February 6, 2008, and (3) Mr. Scott, dated January 24, 2011. The severance agreements are virtually identical and provide that the applicable named executive officer will receive severance benefits if we terminate his or her employment without "cause," or relocate his or her position to a locale beyond a 50-mile radius of our current corporate headquarters in San Diego, California (in either case, an involuntary termination). If an involuntary termination occurs, but not within one year of a "change in control" (defined as in Ms. Salka's employment agreement, see footnote 9, above), benefits include a cash payment equal to the applicable named executive officer's then-current annual base salary, payment of a prorated portion of his or her Average Bonus and reimbursement for the COBRA health coverage for his or her health insurance for a one-year period (or until he or she becomes eligible for comparable coverage under another employer's health plans, if earlier), less his or her share of premiums. If an involuntary termination occurs within one year of a change in control, the applicable named executive officer's severance payment equals two times the sum of (A) his or her then-current annual base salary, plus (B) an amount equal to his or her Average Bonus. Each severance agreement contains a requirement that the named executive officer execute a general release in our favor as a condition to receiving the severance payments.
On February 19, 2019, we entered into new severance agreements with each of Ms. Jackson, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Scott (collectively, the "New Severance Agreements").  The New Severance Agreements contain substantially the same terms set forth in the severance agreements for Ms. Jackson, Mr. Henderson and Mr. Scott that are described in the paragraph immediately above (the "Prior Severance Agreements"), except that the applicable named executive officer can now resign his or her employment for "good reason(10)" and receive the same severance benefits as were applicable under the Prior Severance Agreements.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (10)  In the New Severance Agreements, the term "good reason" means, without the named executive officer's express written consent, the Company's relocation of the named executive officer's principal place of employment to a locale that is more than fifty (50) miles from his or her principal place of employment as of the effective date of the agreement, provided, however, that our relocation of the named executive officer's principal place of employment to our headquarters (as designated in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission) shall not be considered "good reason."  On and after a "change in Control," "good reason" means the occurrence of any of the following events without the named executive officer's express written consent: (i) a material reduction in his or her base salary or target annual bonus compensation as in effect on the date immediately prior to a change in control, (ii) the Company's assignment to the named executive officer without his or her  consent of duties materially and adversely inconsistent with the named executive officer's position, duties or responsibilities as in effect immediately before the change in control, including, but not limited to, any material reduction in such position, duties or responsibilities, or a change in the named executive officer's title or office, as then in effect, or any removal of the named executive officer from any of such positions, titles or offices, or (iii) our relocation of the named executive officer's principal place of employment to a locale that is more than fifty (50) miles from his or her principal place of employment immediately prior to the change in control.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE 
[END TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio
At AMN, we are committed to internal pay equity and equal pay based on role, qualifications, experience and merit, without regard to any legally-protected classifications. We design our compensation programs to be consistent and internally equitable to motivate employees to continue to perform in ways that enhance shareholder value. To this end, our Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees and takes into consideration the substantial amount of variable compensation that is tied to the Company's performance. In 2018, 78% of our CEO's compensation was at risk in the form of performance-based incentive cash and equity. For more details surrounding our executive compensation practices, please visit the subsection titled "Compensation Program Philosophy and Objectives" within the Compensation Discussion and Analysis or in the Company's Executive Compensation Philosophy posted on the Company's website at http://amnhealthcare.investorroom.com/governance-guidelines.
In August 2015, the SEC adopted rules implementing the "CEO pay ratio" disclosure requirements that were mandated by Congress pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The new rules require registrants to disclose the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the CEO's annual total compensation.  Our CEO pay ratio is calculated in accordance with the SEC's final rules regarding the CEO pay ratio disclosure requirements promulgated pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
In 2017, we identified our employee population for the purposes of calculating our CEO pay ratio as of October 27, 2017.  On this date, we had approximately 2,879 corporate employees.  During the fourth quarter of 2017, we had an average of (1) 9,234 nurses, allied and other clinical healthcare professionals, (2) 384 executive and clinical leadership interim staff, and (3) 349 medical coding professionals and case managers contracted to work for us. This does not include our locum tenens, all of whom are independent contractors and not our employees.
To identify our median employee, we examined the 2017 total cash and equity compensation for all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, excluding our CEO and including the healthcare professionals mentioned above, as of October 27, 2017. Wages were annualized for full-time corporate employees that were not employed by us for the entire calendar year. Compensation for our healthcare professionals was not annualized. Other than the foregoing, we did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to our employees' total cash and equity compensation and used this consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee.
After identifying the median employee, we calculated his/her annual total compensation using the same SEC rules we use for calculating the annual total compensation of our named executive officers, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table of the Executive Compensation Disclosure section above.
Pursuant to SEC rules, we are permitted to calculate our 2018 CEO pay ratio using the same median employee that we identified in 2017 because we do not believe there have been any changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during 2018 that would have a significant impact on our pay ratio disclosure. However, since the median employee identified in 2017 is no longer employed by Company, we substituted a different employee whose compensation was substantially similar to the median employee that we identified in 2017 as our median employee for purposes of calculating our ratio in 2018, as permitted by SEC guidance.
In 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $51,140.47, and our CEO's annual total compensation was $5,089,032, of which $3,993,751 was variable compensation based on the performance of the Company. The resulting ratio of the total annual compensation of our median employee compared to the total annual compensation of our CEO in 2018 is 100:1.
The SEC rules do not allow for companies to annualize compensation paid to temporary employees. Our healthcare professionals, who comprise roughly 75% of our workforce, are temporary employees. Since we are unable to annualize these healthcare professionals' compensation, we do not believe that the above ratio accurately reflects our pay practices relative to the compensation of our CEO. We believe that measuring the compensation paid to our median corporate employee more accurately reflects our pay practices relative to the compensation of our CEO. In 2018, the ratio of the total annual compensation of our median corporate employee compared to the total annual compensation of our CEO is 80:1.
The pay ratio was calculated in accordance with SEC rules based upon our reasonable judgment and assumptions. The SEC rules do not specify a single methodology for identification of the median employee or calculation of the pay ratio, and other companies may use assumptions and methodologies that are different from those used by us in calculating their pay ratio. Accordingly, the pay ratio disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to the Company's pay ratio as disclosed above.

 PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, enables our shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. As previously disclosed, the Board has determined that it will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis, and the next shareholder advisory vote will occur at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
As described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section above, we design our executive compensation programs to, among other things, attract, motivate, and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success. Under these programs, we reward our named executive officers for the Company's successful performance, the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, and the realization of increased value for our shareholders. The executive compensation packages paid to our named executive officers are substantially tied to our key business objectives and total shareholder return, to align with the interests of our shareholders. The Board maintains oversight over our executive pay programs and adheres to the highest level of corporate governance with their design. To this end, they closely monitor evolving best practices, including the compensation programs and pay levels of executives at peer companies to ensure that our compensation programs do not fall outside of the normal range of relevant market practices.
We have two shareholder approved incentive plans that we use to motivate, retain and reward our executives. These cash and equity plans make up a majority of the pay we provide to our executives. As a result of this pay-for-performance focused structure, our named executive officers generally realized an amount significantly above their target compensation from 2016 - 2018. During this three-year period, our 
Common Stock price appreciated 83% on a cumulative basis during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and we delivered strong financial and operational results. We believe our performance pay structure appropriately incents executives without excessive risk. In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to emphasize its philosophy of pay for performance by utilizing TSR PRSUs and AEBITDA PRSUs.
We ask that you support the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying tables contained in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and narrative disclosure."
Because your vote is advisory, it will not bind us, the Compensation Committee, or our Board. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs and policies.

[END TABLE]
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting, evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, evaluating and expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
KPMG LLP ("KPMG") is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor, evaluate and oversee these processes. The Audit Committee members are not employees of the Company, and are not professional accountants or auditors. The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board to fulfill its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information provided to shareholders and others, the systems of internal controls that management has established to preserve the Company's assets and the audit process. It is not the Audit Committee's duty or responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. In giving the Audit Committee's recommendation to the Board, it has relied on management's representations that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and on the representations of the independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, included in its report on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, subject to shareholder ratification, of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The members of the Audit Committee are independent as defined by Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management management's report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as well as KPMG's report related to its audit of (i) the consolidated financial statements; and (ii) the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees). In addition, the Audit Committee has received from KPMG the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with KPMG its independence. The Audit Committee also considered whether KPMG's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with KPMG's independence. KPMG advised the Audit Committee that KPMG was and continues to be independent accountants with respect to the Company.
The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the overall scope and plans for its audits. The Audit Committee has met with KPMG, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its audits, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and KPMG, the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the report of KPMG to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.

Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered in connection with the (i) annual audits of our consolidated financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and (ii) reviews of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports.
Audit-Related Fees
KPMG billed $48,968 and $142,256 for audit-related services in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Audit-related fees consist principally of fees not reported under the "Audit Fees" heading, including fees in respect of accounting consultations.
Tax Fees
KPMG billed (1) $412,974 in 2018 for professional services rendered primarily relating to consultations in connection with an audit of the Company by the California State Franchise Tax Board, research and development credits and state sales and use tax compliance, and (2) $462,035 in 2017 for professional services rendered primarily relating to consultations in connection with an audit of the Company by the Internal Revenue Service and tax consultations related to research and development credits. 
All Other Fees
We did not incur any other fees billed by KPMG in 2018 or 2017. 
Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, it is the policy of the Audit Committee to review in advance, and grant any appropriate pre-approvals of all auditing services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and all non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm as permitted by Section 10A of the Exchange Act, and in connection therewith, to approve all fees and other terms of engagement.

PROPOSAL 4
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL
The Company has been advised that Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, who has indicated he is a beneficial owner of at least $2,000 in market value of AMN's Common Stock, intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AMN is not responsible for the accuracy or content of this shareholder proposal, which is presented as received from the proponent in accordance with SEC rules. 
[END TABLE]
"Proposal 4 - Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access
RESOLVED: Stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated documents, to including the following change:
A shareholder proxy access director candidate shall not need to obtain a specific percentage vote in order to qualify as a shareholder proxy access director candidate at any future shareholder meeting.
This proposal is important because a shareholder proxy access candidate might not get a 25%-vote even if he or she is the most qualified candidate to join our Board of Directors. Shareholders may simply believe that at the time of the annual meeting that the company is not ripe for a proxy access candidate and hence may vote against the candidate simply because the timing is not right. A year later a majority of shareholders might determine that the timing is right and hence they should not be deprived of voting for a highly qualified candidate.
A shareholder proposal on another topic received strong support at our 2018 annual meeting. The 2018 shareholder proposal to enable 10% of shareholder to call a special meeting won 44% support. If all shareholders has access to proxy voting advice that was independent of our management, this 44%-support would likely have been near 51% or higher.
Please vote yes: 
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access – Proposal 4"
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Board of Director's Statement in Opposition 
[END TABLE]
The Board has considered the proponent's proposal to modify the proxy access provisions of the Company's Bylaws to eliminate the renomination restriction for director candidates failing to achieve at least 25% voting support.  The Board does not find this proposal to be in the best interests of our shareholders for the following reasons: (1) our Board proactively adopted proxy access in 2017, the mechanics of which were informed through discussions with many of our shareholders, and (2) requiring proxy access director candidates to achieve at least 25% voting support or wait two years to be renominated appropriately balances the (i) important and meaningful opportunity for shareholders to nominate directors with (ii) prudent use of the Company's resources, and would create a financial and administrative burden on our Board, the majority of our shareholders and the Company.
Over the past three years, we have formally engaged with our shareholders to discuss our corporate governance practices, including proxy access, to ensure that we are implementing those best practices that drive shareholder value. During our discussions, we engaged with our shareholders regarding proxy access and the potential terms of proxy access provisions that our shareholders would view as appropriate. The Board then amended our Bylaws to proactively implement proxy access with features that were informed by our shareholders. Since then, we have consistently received positive feedback regarding our proactive adoption of proxy access and our adopted proxy access mechanics. We believe our proxy access provisions are consistent with market practice and strike the appropriate balance between providing shareholders with meaningful proxy access rights while protecting against waste and abuse.
The Board believes that its deliberations with respect to this proposal reflect the outcomes of the Company's discussions with shareholders. Your Board recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 4.

As demonstrated by its proactive adoption of proxy access, the Board supports shareholders' right to nominate director candidates and values shareholder input, which is why our Bylaws currently require proxy access director candidates who fail to achieve minimum voting support of 25% to wait two years to be renominated. This threshold was carefully considered by our Board and is designed to strike a balance between providing a meaningful right for shareholders to nominate director candidates via the Company's proxy materials and protecting against the risk that the Company be required to incur significant expenses and administrative burdens by continually accommodating director candidates that our shareholders overwhelmingly do not support.
Our Board does not believe that expending the resources necessary to repeatedly renominate a candidate that is opposed by 75% or more of the votes cast is a valid use of Company resources.
The Company is committed to upholding corporate governance best practices
We strive to be a leader in corporate governance best practices and implemented a formal outreach program where we regularly elicit the views of investors on topics such as this (see "Overview of Our Corporate Governance Program" on page 17 and "Our Shareholder Outreach Summary" on page 19 of this Proxy Statement for further details).
The Board believes that the Company's commitment to ongoing and consistent dialogue with shareholders, combined with the Board's practice of continually assessing its composition to most effectively align with the Company's strategic objectives, sufficiently serves to accommodate AMN's shareholders without the unnecessary burden and expenses associated with eliminating the proxy access renomination voting support threshold.
Among other things, as described in the "Overview of Our Corporate Governance Program" section above, the Company recently added Ms. Daphne E. Jones to the Board to leverage her thought leadership and extensive experience in digital technology.  The Board's addition of Ms. Jones was driven, in part, as a result of our discussions with investors on the topic of Board composition. We continue to believe that the composition of our current Board collectively possesses the necessary experience, skills and knowledge, as well as a high level of engagement, to serve the best interests of our shareholders.
The Board's position is underpinned by the Company's commitment to, and maintenance of, the highest corporate governance QualityScore ranking available under the "Shareholder Rights" pillar designed by Institutional Shareholder Services to assist investors in reviewing quality and risk factors.
We also note that of the largest U.S. public companies based on revenue and market capitalization having adopted proxy access, more than half have adopted proxy access mechanics that include renomination restrictions equal to or more restrictive than the Company's. A recent study shows that approximately 69% of over 550 companies surveyed had a renomination threshold, and that approximately 70% of such companies set that threshold at 25%, the same as the Company's. Thus, our current proxy access renomination mechanics are consistent with prevailing market practice.
For all the above reasons, among others, the proponent's proposed elimination of the two year renomination restriction for proxy access director candidates that fail to achieve at least 25% voting support  is neither necessary nor in shareholders' best interest.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
The following table sets forth certain information as of February 20, 2019 (the "Record Date") regarding (i) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock, (ii) each director and director nominee of the Company, (iii) the named executive officers and (iv) all executive officers and directors as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, each person has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to such shares.
Beneficial ownership includes shares for which a person, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting or investment power, or both, and also includes shares that each such person or group had the right to acquire within 60 days following the Record Date, including upon the exercise of options or warrants. Where applicable, we calculate the percentage of Common Stock beneficially owned by including the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be beneficially owned by reason of the right to acquire such shares within 60 days following the Record Date in both the numerator and the denominator.

 (2)  Of the 4,936,398 shares of Common Stock The Vanguard Group ("Vanguard") beneficially owns, it has sole voting power over 95,668 shares, shared voting power over 7,117 shares, sole dispositive power over 4,837,913 shares and shared dispositive power over 94,485 shares. Vanguard's address is 100 Vanguard Blvd., Malvern, Pennsylvania 19355. Ownership amount and other information contained in this table and accompanying footnote for Vanguard, including voting power and dispositive power information, are based solely on information contained in the Schedule 13G/A (Amendment No. 5) filed by Vanguard with the SEC on February 11, 2019. 
 (3)  Includes (A) 207,686 shares of Common Stock owned directly by Ms. Salka and (B) 97,300 shares of Common Stock deemed to be beneficially owned by reason of the right to acquire such shares within 60 days following the Record Date, which are shares she had a right to receive on the Record Date if she exercised all 116,369 of her vested SARs on the Record Date. Ms. Salka also has 101,243 vested RSUs that are deferred until her separation from service. Under the terms of the applicable award agreements, if Ms. Salka is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, which she is, the distribution of her Common Stock would be delayed six months and one day. Accordingly, we have not included her 101,243 deferred vested RSUs and PRSUs in the table above because she would have no right to receive such shares within 60 days of the Record Date even if her employment with us terminated on the Record Date. If we were to include such amounts, the number of shares beneficially owned by her as set forth in this table would be increased by the corresponding amount.

 (4)  Certain named executive officers and directors have vested equity awards in the form of SARs. Under our SARs, grantees have the right to acquire an amount of our Common Stock equal in value to the difference between the fair value of our Common Stock on the date of exercise less the grant price.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act generally requires our directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of our Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and shareholders who own greater than 10% of our 
Common Stock are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of Section 16(a) forms they file. We believe that all of our directors, named executive officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with all filing requirements applicable to them in 2018.
Shareholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
From time to time, shareholders present proposals, which may be proper subject for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the next annual meeting of shareholders. Any shareholder who desires to bring a proposal at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders without including such proposal in our proxy statement must deliver written notice to our Secretary not before December 18, 2019 and not later than January 17, 2020. We must receive shareholder proposals intended to be included in the 2020 proxy statement no later than November 7, 2019.
The shareholder proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act.
If a shareholder proposal is not properly submitted for inclusion in the 2020 proxy statement pursuant to the requirements described above (but otherwise complies with the advanced notice provisions of our Bylaws), management will be permitted to vote proxies in its discretion if it advises shareholders in the 2020 proxy statement about the nature of the matter and how management intends to vote on such matter.
Annual Report
Shareholders will receive with this proxy statement a copy of our Annual Report including the financial statements set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and certain exhibits thereto.
Shareholders may request additional copies by sending a written request to AMN Healthcare Services, Inc., 12400 High Bluff Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92130, Attn: Denise L. Jackson, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.
Delivery of Proxy Statement, Annual Report or Notice of Internet Availability
We may satisfy SEC rules regarding delivery of our proxy materials, including our proxy statement, or delivery of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") by delivering a single copy of these documents to an address shared by two or more shareholders. This process is known as "householding." To the extent we have done so, we have delivered only one set of proxy materials or one Notice, as applicable, to shareholders who share an address with another shareholder, unless contrary instructions were received prior to the mailing date.
We undertake to deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of our proxy statement, our annual report and/or our Notice, as requested, to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of these documents was delivered. To make such a request, please contact our Secretary at the address set forth in the section immediately above entitled "Annual Report" or by calling our offices at 866-871-8519. If your Common Stock is held by a brokerage firm or bank and you prefer to receive separate copies of our proxy statement, our annual report or the Notice, either now or in the future, please contact your brokerage or bank. If your brokerage or bank is unable or unwilling to assist you, please contact us as indicated above.
Shareholders sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of proxy materials and who want to receive a single copy of our annual reports, proxy statements and/or our Notices may do so by contacting our Secretary at the address set forth in the section immediately above entitled "Annual Report" or by calling our offices at 866-871-8519.

GENERAL INFORMATION
When and where is the Annual Meeting?
Our 2019 Annual Meeting will be held at our offices located at 8840 Cypress Waters Boulevard, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75019 on Wednesday, April 17, 2019, at 
8:30 a.m. Central Time, or at any subsequent time that may be necessary by any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting.
What is "Notice and Access" and why does AMN use it?
We are making the proxy solicitation materials available to our shareholders electronically via the Internet under the Notice and Access rules and regulations of the SEC. On or about March 7, 2019, we will mail to our shareholders the Notice in lieu of mailing a full set of proxy materials. Accordingly, our proxy materials are first being made available to our shareholders on or about March 7, 2019. The Notice includes information on how to access and review the proxy materials and how to vote online. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials.
Instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, shareholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. Electronic delivery decreases costs, expedites distribution, and reduces our environmental impact. Environmental stewardship is a component of our Corporate Social Responsibility Program, and we encourage shareholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. Shareholders who received the Notice but would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail should follow the instructions in the Notice for requesting such materials.
Why am I receiving these proxy materials?
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of our Board for use at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide under SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting your shares.
Proxies in proper form received by us at or before the time of the Annual Meeting will be voted as specified. You may specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on your proxy card. If a proxy card is dated, signed and returned without specifying choices, the proxies will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board set forth in this proxy statement, and, in their discretion, upon such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting. Business transacted at the Annual Meeting will be confined to the purposes stated in the Notice of Annual Meeting. Shares of our Common Stock, cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the holder is present in person or represented by proxy.
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
The Notice will provide you with instructions on how to (1) view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet, and (2) instruct us to send proxy materials to you by email. The proxy materials are also available under the "Investor Relations" tab on our website at www.amnhealthcare.com. Choosing to access our proxy materials electronically will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you, and will reduce the impact of our annual meetings on the environment.

What is the vote required for each proposal and what are my choices?
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal  Vote Required  Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed 
 Proposal  Vote Required  Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed 
 Proposal 1: Election of eight directors  Majority of the votes cast  No  
 Proposal 2: Advisory vote on executive compensation  Majority of the shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy  No  
 Proposal 3: Ratification of auditors for fiscal year 2019  Majority of the shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy  Yes  
 Proposal 4: Shareholder Proposal - Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access  Majority of the shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy  No  
[END TABLE]
With respect to Proposal 1, the election of directors, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. Our Bylaws require that in an election where the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each director will be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy). A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of shares cast "FOR" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director's election. In accordance with our Bylaws, the following do not count as votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld, (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting, but for which an ABSTAIN vote was cast, and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In an uncontested election, a nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast will not be elected.
An incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority of the votes cast will continue to serve as a holdover director, but will tender his or her resignation to the Board. Within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results, the Governance and Compliance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken, and the Board will act on the Governance and Compliance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and rationale.
With respect to Proposals 2, 3 and 4 (or on any other matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting), you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. If you ABSTAIN from voting on Proposals 2, 3 or 4, the ABSTAIN vote will have the same effect as an AGAINST vote.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
The Board recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR: the election of the eight directors nominated by the Board and named in this proxy statement, 
• FOR:  the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers, 
• FOR: the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and 
• AGAINST: the shareholder proposal to eliminate the voting support threshold necessary for proxy access director candidates to avoid re-nomination restrictions.

• IN PERSON: in person at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance by Internet, telephone or mail so your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner and your shares are held through a broker, you should follow the instructions in the Notice provided by your broker, or your broker should provide instructions for voting your shares. In these cases, you may vote by Internet, telephone or mail, as applicable. You may vote your shares beneficially held through your broker in person if you attend the Annual Meeting and you obtain a valid proxy card from your broker giving you the legal right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting.
What is the difference between shareholder of record and beneficial owner?
Shareholder of Record. You are a shareholder of record if at the close of business on the Record Date your shares were registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent.
Beneficial Owner. You are a beneficial owner if at the close of business on the Record Date your shares were held by a brokerage firm or other nominee and not in your name. Being a beneficial owner means that, like most of our shareholders, your shares are held in "street name." As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or nominee on how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions your broker or other nominee provides. If you do not provide your broker or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, your broker or nominee will be able to vote your shares as described below.
What will happen if I do not vote my shares?
Shareholders of Record. If you are the shareholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, telephone, Internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Owners. If you are the beneficial owner and you do not direct your broker or nominee on how to vote your shares, your broker or nominee may vote your shares only on those proposals for which it has discretion to vote. Under the rules of the NYSE, your broker or nominee does not have discretion to vote your shares on non-routine matters such as Proposals 1, 2 and 4. We believe that Proposal 3 — ratification of our auditor — is a routine matter for which brokers and nominees can vote on behalf of their clients when voting instructions are not furnished by their clients.

 GENERAL INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
What is the effect of a broker non-vote?
Brokers or other nominees who hold shares for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting of the shares. Broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the 
Annual Meeting, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to certain proposals. Accordingly, a broker non-vote will not impact our ability to obtain a quorum nor will it impact any vote that requires a majority of the votes cast (Proposal 1) or any proposal that requires the majority of the shares entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy (Proposals 2, 3 and 4).
May I revoke my proxy or change my vote?
Yes, you may revoke a proxy you have given at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by (1) sending our Corporate Secretary a letter revoking the proxy, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting, or (2) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting does not, standing alone, constitute your revocation of a proxy.
You may change your vote at any time prior to the voting of your shares at the Annual Meeting by (a) casting a new vote by telephone or over the Internet by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the date before the day of the Annual Meeting, or (b) sending a new proxy card with a later date that is received prior to the Annual Meeting.
How can I find the results of the Annual Meeting?
We will announce preliminary results at the Annual Meeting. We will publish final results in a current report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.
If the official results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available.

 (1)  Segment operating income represents net income plus interest expense (net of interest income) and other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, unallocated corporate overhead, acquisition and integration costs, legal settlement accrual increases and share-based compensation expense. 
 (2)  Please note that the amount set forth in this line item excludes the amounts set forth in the line items below entitled "acquisition and integration costs" and "legal settlement accrual increases." Acquisition and integration costs and legal settlement accrual increases are subsets of unallocated corporate overhead. 
 (3)  AEBITDA represents net income plus interest expense (net of interest income) and other, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration costs, legal settlement accrual increases and share-based compensation expense. Management believes that AEBITDA provides an effective measure of our results, as it excludes certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operating performance and considers measures used in credit facilities. AEBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows for the period, nor has it been presented as an alternative to income from operations or net income as an indicator of operating performance. Although management believes that some of the items excluded from AEBITDA are not indicative of our operating performance, these items do impact the statement of comprehensive income, and management therefore utilizes AEBITDA as an operating performance measure in conjunction with GAAP measures such as net income. 
 (4)  This item represents legal accruals established in connection with settlement agreements entered into during 2018 in two class actions related to wage and hour claims. Since the settlements are largely unrelated to our operating performance, we excluded their impact in the calculation of AEBITDA.  
 (5)  The amount represents the adjustments to AEBITDA decided by the Compensation Committee for bonus calculation and payout only. In establishing Pre-Bonus Adjusted EBITDA targets at the beginning of the year, the Compensation Committee excludes from AEBITDA, the payout of bonuses and other extraordinary items not contemplated in the Company's 2018 annual operating plan that should be excluded for bonus purposes.  
 (6)  Pre-bonus AEBITDA represents the adjustments made to AEBITDA decided by the Compensation Committee.
