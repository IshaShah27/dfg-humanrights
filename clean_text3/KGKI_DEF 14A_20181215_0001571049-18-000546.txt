KINGOLD JEWELRY, INC. 
No. 8 Han Huang Road Jiang'An District Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC 430023
PROXY STATEMENT 
2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
This Proxy Statement and accompanying proxy was first mailed to stockholders on or about November 16, 2018, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors ("Board") of Kingold Jewelry, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("we," "us", the "Company," or "Kingold"), for use at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held at 10:00 AM local time on December 15, 2018, at the Kingold Jewelry Corporate Center, No. 8 Han Huang Road, Jiang'An District, Wuhan, China, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is +86 27 65694977. 
INFORMATION CONCERNING SOLICITATION AND VOTING 
Record Date and Share Ownership 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on October 22, 2018, which date is referred to herein as the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, 66,113,502 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and held of record by approximately 73 stockholders of record. 
A list of these stockholders will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at our principal executive offices, at No. 8 Han Huang Road, Jiang'an District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC 430023 for at least ten days prior to the annual meeting. The list will also be available for inspection at the annual meeting. 
Voting, Solicitation and Revocability of Proxy 
Registered stockholders can vote by mail. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, follow the voting instructions on the form you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. 
In order to ensure that your vote is counted, please return your proxy card, properly signed, and the shares represented will be voted in accordance with your directions. You can specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on the proxy card. If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying choices, the shares will be voted in line with the Board's recommendations for Proposal Nos. 1 through 3. 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by executing a later-voted proxy by mail, by voting by ballot at the Annual Meeting, or by providing written notice of the revocation to our Secretary at our principal executive offices. 
IMPORTANT:   All stockholders are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting in person. To assure your representation at the annual meeting, you are urged to vote your shares by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card as promptly as possible in the enclosed self-addressed envelope. Any stockholder attending the annual meeting may vote in person even if he or she returned a proxy. However, if a stockholder's shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and the stockholder wishes to vote at the annual meeting, the stockholder must obtain from the record holder a proxy issued in his or her name. ​
Your vote is important. Accordingly, regardless of whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you are urged to vote by signing and returning the accompanying proxy card.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is generally limited to our stockholders and their authorized representatives. All stockholders must bring an acceptable form of identification, such as a passport or driver's license, in order to attend the Annual Meeting in person. In addition, if you hold shares of common stock in "street name" and would like to attend the Annual Meeting, you will need to bring an account statement or other acceptable evidence of ownership of shares as of the close of business on the record date; however, those who hold shares in "street name" cannot vote their shares at the meeting. If your shares are held in "street name" in a brokerage account by a bank, broker or by another nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares. As the beneficial owner of those shares, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote and you also are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the bank, broker, or nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 
If you do attend, you may vote by ballot at the Annual Meeting, thereby canceling any proxy previously given. However, attendance at the Annual Meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you actually vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
In the event that any matter not described in this Proxy Statement properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders named in the accompanying proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxy in their discretion. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other matter that might be presented at the Annual Meeting. 
Each share of common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote. The holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders may withhold authority to vote for one or more of the nominees for director and may abstain on one or more of the other matters that may come before the Annual Meeting. If, however, a quorum is not present or represented, the Chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present, either in person or represented by proxy, have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the Annual Meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. 
Assuming a quorum is present, the election of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter 
The inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting will determine the existence of a quorum and will tabulate the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, abstentions and broker "non-votes" (shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee that does not have the authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) will be counted by us as present at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, however, do not technically constitute a "vote cast" (affirmatively or negatively) on any matter and thus will be disregarded in the calculation of votes cast and whether stockholder approval of the matter has been obtained. Therefore, an abstention or broker non-vote will not have the effect of a vote for or against the proposal and will not be counted in determining the number of votes required for approval, though they will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting in determining the presence of a quorum. 
Under the NASDAQ rules regulating banks, brokers or other nominees and under applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Commission, brokers, banks or other nominees that have not received voting instructions from a customer ten days prior to the meeting date may only vote the customer's shares in discretion of the bank, broker or other nominee on proposals regarding "routine" matters, which in most cases includes the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, without your specific instructions, your bank, broker, or other nominee may only vote your shares with respect to Proposal No. 2 (the ratification of the appointment of Friedman LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018).  ​
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by us. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, we may utilize some of the officers and employees (who will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salaries), to solicit proxies personally and by telephone. Currently, we do not intend to retain a solicitation firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies. We may request banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward copies of the proxy materials to their principals and to request authority for the execution of proxies and will reimburse such persons for their expenses in so doing.  ​
MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING
PROPOSAL NO. 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
Our amended and restated bylaws provide that our Board shall be fixed from time to time by the stockholders or by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors. Our Board currently consists of five directors, each serving a one-year term. The existing directors are Messrs. Zhihong Jia, Guang Chen, Zhiyong Xia, and Jun Wang, and Ms. Alice Io Wai Wu. At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders will vote on the reelection of each of them. All directors will hold office until our next annual meeting of stockholders, at which time stockholders will vote on the election and qualification of their successors. 
All shares duly voted will be voted for the election of directors as specified by the stockholders. No proxy may be voted for more people than the number of nominees listed below. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them FOR the election of each of the nominees named below, all of whom are presently directors. If any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, although we know of no reason to anticipate that this will occur, the proxies will be voted for any nominee designated by the present Board to fill the vacancy. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.

Indicates Independent Director/Nominee 
​
Vote Required 
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, assuming a quorum is present. 
Recommendation of Our Board 
Our Board recommends that Kingold stockholders vote FOR the election of the nominees listed above. ​
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Independence
In accordance with the current listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our Board, on an annual basis, affirmatively determines the independence of each director or nominee for election as a director. Our Board has determined that three of our current directors, Ms. Wu, Messrs. Chen and Xia, are "independent directors" as defined under the NASDAQ Rules, constituting a majority of independent directors of our Board as required by the corporate governance rules of NASDAQ. In making this determination, our Board has concluded that none of those members has an employment, business, family or other relationship that, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
Board Leadership Structure and Corporate Governance 
In accordance with our Bylaws, our Board elects our officers, including a President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and such other officers as our Board may appoint from time to time. In addition, our Board may appoint a Chairman of the Board. Mr. Jia has served as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since the consummation of our December 2009 reverse acquisition transaction, overseeing our day-to-day operations while also leading our Board. The Board believes that the current model is effective for our continued growth in that the combined position of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman maximizes strategic advantages and Mr. Jia's industry expertise. Mr. Jia, given his extensive knowledge of China's gold jewelry industry, coupled with the fact that he has overseen our operations since inception, is the director most familiar with our business and industry, and is best positioned to set and execute strategic priorities. Mr. Jia provides a strong link between management and the Board, which promotes clear communication and enhances strategic planning and implementation of corporate strategies. Mr. Jia's leadership, driven by his deep business and industry expertise, enhances the Board's exercise of its responsibilities. In addition, this model provides enhanced efficiency and effective decision-making and clear accountability. The Board has not named a lead independent director. 
The Chairman may preside at meetings of our Board. In his absence, any other director or any member of any committee designated by the Board may chair a meeting of the Board or such committee. A director is not required to hold any shares in us by way of qualification. A director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested. A director may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, mortgage its undertaking, property and uncalled capital and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any obligation of the Company or of any third party. 
The Company's corporate governance serves to ensure that members of the Board are independent from management and that the Board adequately performs its function to ensure that the interests of the Board and management are in alignment with the interests of the stockholders. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to promote effective governance of the Company. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at www.kingoldjewelry.com under "Investors — Corporate Governance Guidelines." 
On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is required to complete a Director and Officer Questionnaire. Within this questionnaire are requirements for disclosure of any transactions with the Company in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, have a direct or indirect material conflict of interest. 
The Company maintains an insider trading policy that provides that the Company's personnel may not buy, sell or engage in other transactions in the Company's stock while aware of material non-public information and that restricts trading in Company securities for a limited group of Company employees (including executive officers and directors) to defined window periods that follow our quarterly earnings releases. The policy is available on our website at www.kingoldjewelry.com under "Investors — Insider Policy." ​
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Risk is inherent in every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including strategic risks, enterprise risks, financial risks, regulatory risks, and others. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks that the Company faces, while our Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management, and is tasked with assuring that the long-term interests of our stockholders are being served. In its risk oversight role, our Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. 
Our Board believes that establishing the right "tone at the top," and full and open communication between management and our Board, are essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our Chairman meets regularly with other senior officers to discuss strategy and the risks we face. Senior management is available to address any questions or concerns raised by our Board on risk management-related and any other matters. Our Chairman holds strategic planning sessions with senior management to discuss strategies, key challenges, and risks and opportunities for us. 
While our Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight at our company, our Board committees assist our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk as further set forth below. Our Board committees report to our Board on significant risks and other matters. 
Executive Sessions 
The independent members of our Board meet in executive session (without the participation of executive officers or other non-independent directors) at least once each year, after a regularly scheduled Board meeting, and at any other time requested by any independent director. The chairman of our Nominating Committee is responsible for calling and presiding over executive sessions or, if such person is absent, by the independent director present who has the most seniority on our Board. 
Committees and Meeting Attendance 
Our Board held three meetings and acted one time by unanimous written consent in connection with matters related to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Our Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee. The Audit Committee held four meetings and acted one time by unanimous written consent during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Compensation Committee held one meeting and did not act by unanimous written consent during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Nominating Committee held one meeting and acted two times by unanimous written consent during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. 
During 2017, each member of the Board attended or participated in 60% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which such person has been a director) and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which such person served (during the periods that such person served). Our Bylaws provide that the Chairman of our Board shall preside at all meetings of our stockholders. Each director is expected to make reasonable efforts to attend Board meetings, meetings of committees of which such director is a member and the Annual Meetings of Stockholders. All five of our then sitting directors participated in the 2017 Annual Meetings of Stockholders. ​
Committee Composition 
The following table sets forth the current membership of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee. Each committee conducts its business pursuant to a written charter approved by our Board, copies of which are available on our website at www.kingoldjewelry.com under "Investors — Committee Charters."

Audit Committee.   Ms. Wu, Mr. Chen and Mr. Xia currently serve on the Audit Committee, which is chaired by Ms. Wu. Our Audit Committee falls within the definition of  "Audit Committee" under Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. In addition to meeting The NASDAQ Stock Market's tests for director independence, directors serving on our Audit Committee must meet two basic criteria set forth in the rules promulgated by the Commission. First, Audit Committee members are barred from accepting, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from us or any affiliate of us, other than in the member's capacity as a member of our Board and any Board committee. Second, a member of our Audit Committee may not be an affiliated person of us or any subsidiary of us, apart from his or her capacity as a member of our Board and any Board committee. Our Board has determined that each member of our Audit Committee meets these independence requirements, in addition to the independence criteria established by The NASDAQ Stock Market. Our Board has determined that each Audit Committee member has sufficient knowledge in financial and auditing matters to serve on the Audit Committee. Our Board has designated Ms. Wu as an "Audit Committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K.

the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

Each member of the Nominating Committee is "independent" as that term is defined in the rules of the Commission and within the meaning of such term as defined under the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. 
Our Nominating Committee makes recommendations to our Board regarding the nomination of candidates to stand for election as members of our Board, evaluates our Board's performance, and provides oversight of corporate governance and ethical standards. Our Nominating Committee has the responsibility to oversee the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and propose changes to such guidelines from time to time as may be appropriate. Our Nominating Committee assists our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and executive officers, and corporate governance. For more information regarding our director nomination processes, see the discussion below under the heading "Director Nominations." ​
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity (other than a subsidiary or consolidated affiliate of the Company) that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee. 
Director Nominations 
As noted above, the Board has determined that each member of the Nominating Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") is independent as defined under the rules of the Commission and within the meaning of such term as defined under the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. 
The Committee's process for considering all candidates for election as directors, including stockholder-recommended candidates, is designed to ensure that the Committee fulfills its responsibility to recommend candidates that are properly qualified and are not serving any special interest groups, but rather the best interest of all of the stockholders. 
In identifying candidates for membership on the Board, the Committee seeks directors with established strong professional reputations and experience in areas relevant to the strategy and operations of our business. The Committee seeks directors who possess the qualities of integrity and candor, who have strong analytical skills and who are willing to engage management and each other in a constructive and collaborative fashion. The Committee also seeks directors who have the ability and commitment to devote significant time and energy to service on the Board and its committees. Directors should have varied educational and professional experiences and backgrounds that, collectively, provide meaningful guidance and counsel to management. We believe that all of our directors meet the foregoing qualifications. The Nominating Committee does not have a specific policy in place with regard to the consideration of diversity when identifying director nominees; however, the Nominating Committee does consider diversity of opinion and experience when nominating directors, and, as a company, we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of inclusion and fairness. 
If there is a need for a new director because of an open position on the Board or because the Board has determined to increase the total number of directors, the Committee may retain a third-party search firm to locate candidates that meet the needs of the Board at that time. When a search firm is used, the firm typically provides information on a number of candidates for review and discussion by the Committee. If appropriate, the Committee chairman and some or all of the members of the Committee may interview potential candidates. If in these circumstances the Committee determines that a potential candidate meets the needs of the Board and possesses the relevant qualifications, the Committee will vote to recommend to the Board the election of such candidate as a director. 
The Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders if properly submitted to the Committee. Stockholders wishing to recommend persons for consideration by the Committee as nominees for election to the Board can do so by writing to the Nominating Committee, c/o Mr. Guang Chen, Kingold Jewelry, Inc., No. 8 Han Huang Road, Jiang'an District, Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC 430023. Recommendations must include the proposed nominee's name, detailed biographical data, work history, qualifications and corporate and charitable affiliations, as well as a written statement from the proposed nominee consenting to be named as a nominee and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director. The Committee will then consider the candidate and the candidate's qualifications using the criteria as set forth above. The Committee may discuss with the stockholder making the nomination the reasons for making the nomination and the qualifications of the candidate. The Committee may then interview the candidate and may also use the services of a search firm to provide additional information about the candidate prior to making a recommendation to the Board. ​
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including those officers responsible for financial reporting. The most recent version is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.kingoldjewelry.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement. If we make any substantive amendments to the code or grant any waiver from a provision of the code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website, as well as via any other means required by applicable law. 
Communications by Stockholders with Directors 
The Chairman of our Board may receive and distribute to our Board, and arrange for responses to, communications from stockholders. Stockholders may communicate with any and all of our directors by transmitting correspondence by mail, facsimile or email, addressed as follows: 
c/o Corporate Secretary Kingold Jewelry, Inc. No. 8 Han Huang Road Jiang'an District Wuhan, Hubei Province, PRC 430023 Email Address: bl@kingoldjewelry.com 
Our Corporate Secretary maintains a log of such communications and transmits as soon as practicable such communications to the Chairman and the identified director addressee(s), unless there are safety or security concerns that mitigate against further transmission of the communications, as determined by the Corporate Secretary. Our Board or individual directors so addressed are advised of any communication withheld for safety or security reasons as soon as practicable. The mailing envelope should contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Board Communication" or "Director Communication." All such letters must clearly state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board or just certain specified directors. The Corporate Secretary relays all communications to directors absent safety or security issues. ​
PROPOSAL NO. 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
General 
Our Board has appointed the firm of Friedman LLP, or Friedman, as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and recommends that stockholders vote for ratification of this appointment. 
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of Friedman as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise; however, our Board is submitting the appointment of Friedman to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, our Audit Committee and our Board will reconsider whether or not to retain Friedman. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Board in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Representatives of Friedman are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, but we expect that they will participate telephonically, they will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The table set forth below lists the fees billed to the Company by Friedman for audit services rendered in connection with the audits of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and fees billed for other services rendered by Friedman during these periods.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee consists of three members: Alice Io Wai Wu, Guang Chen and Zhiyong Xia. All of the members are independent directors under the NASDAQ and SEC audit committee structure and membership requirements. The Audit Committee has certain duties and powers as described in its written charter adopted by the Board. 
The Audit Committee is responsible primarily for assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility of reviewing the financial information that will be provided to stockholders and others, appointing the independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing the services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and internal audit department, evaluating the Company's accounting policies and the Company's system of internal controls that management and the Board have established, and reviewing significant financial transactions. The Audit Committee does not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of the Company's financial statements. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibility of appointing and reviewing the services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit related services. 
The Company maintains an auditor independence policy that bans its auditors from performing non-financial consulting services, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit Committee approve the audit and non-audit services and related budget in advance, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that the Company may not enter into auditor engagements for non-audit services without the express approval of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the Company's management and Friedman LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm ("Friedman"). The Audit Committee has also discussed under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") standards. 
The Audit Committee also has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Friedman required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Friedman's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Friedman its independence from the Company.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
We have established procedures for identifying related parties and related party transactions, and for ensuring that any changes in the status of related parties are brought to the attention of the Board and management in a timely manner. For transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business, such as customer sales, supply purchases, subcontracting or consulting services, we apply the same review and approval process as we would in the context of other commercial agreements. All such transactions with related parties are summarized and provided to our Audit Committee for review. For transactions with related parties outside the ordinary course of business, such as significant capital expenditures, capital raising activities and mergers and acquisitions, the transactions must be approved by our Audit Committee. The following is a summary of the related party transactions in which we are engaged for the past two fiscal years. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company received working capital from Mr. Zhihong Jia, the CEO and Chairman of the Company, to pay certain expenses to various service providers on behalf of the Company. Such proceeds are unsecured and payable on demand with no interest. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the amount due to this related party was $2,630,301 and $7,223,321, respectively. 
For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Mr. Zhihong Jia, the CEO and Chairman of the Company, together with his wife provided their personal guarantees to various financial institutions to supports the Company's loan. ​

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were timely as of the date of this report.  ​
PROPOSAL NO. 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Background 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that, not less frequently than once every three years, we provide stockholders with an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed herein. Accordingly, we are requesting your advisory (non-binding) approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" vote. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement for a detailed discussion about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal 2017 compensation of our named executive officers. 
Our compensation program is designed to reward each individual named executive officer's contribution to the advancement of our overall performance and execution of our goals, ideas and objectives. It is designed to reward and encourage exceptional performance at the individual level in the areas of organization, creativity and responsibility while supporting our core values and ambitions. This in turn aligns the interest of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, and thus with our interests. Stockholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and other compensation related sections of this Proxy Statement. 
Our Compensation Committee and our Board believe that these policies and procedures are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals. 
We are asking you to indicate your support for the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, our general compensation policies, the compensation of our Board, or our compensation policies as they relate to risk management. Rather, this vote relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we are asking you to vote, on an advisory basis, "For" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Kingold Jewelry, Inc. (the "Company") hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement." 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Kingold and will not require us to take any action or overrule any decisions we have made. Furthermore, because this advisory vote primarily relates to compensation that has already been paid or contractually committed to our named executive officers, there is generally no opportunity for us to revisit these decisions. However, our Board, including our Compensation Committee, values the opinions of our stockholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the compensation of named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and evaluate what actions, if any, may be appropriate to address those concerns. 
Vote Required 
Approval of this resolution shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the matter, assuming a quorum is present. 
Recommendation of Our Board 
Our Board recommends a vote FOR approval of the foregoing resolution. Proxies will be so voted unless stockholders specify otherwise in their proxies. ​
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis relates to compensation paid to our executive officers ("NEOs") named in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal 2017. 
The Company's NEOs for Fiscal 2017 were as follows: 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the executive compensation discussion and tables that immediately follow describe our compensation, objectives, the strategy and elements of our compensation program, and our compensation-setting process as applied to our NEOs. 
Compensation Program 
Our compensation program is designed to reward each individual named executive officer for his or her contribution to the advancement of our overall performance and execution of our goals, ideas and objectives. It is designed to reward and encourage exceptional performance at the individual level in the areas of organization, creativity and responsibility while supporting our core values and ambitions. This in turn aligns the interest of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, and thus with our interests. 
The principal objectives of our compensation program are: 
 attract, motivate and retain executives who drive our success and industry leadership; and 
​
 provide each executive, from vice president to Chief Executive Officer, with a base salary on the market value of that role, and the individual's demonstrated ability to perform that role.
​
Compensation Strategy: Policies and Procedures 
Determining Executive Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee generally reviews and approves the compensation program for executive officers annually after the close of each year. Reviewing the compensation program at such time allows the Compensation Committee to consider the overall performance of the past year and the financial and operating plans for the upcoming year in determining the compensation program for the upcoming year. 
A named executive officer's base salary is determined by an assessment of his sustained performance against individual job responsibilities, including, where appropriate, the impact of his performance on our business results, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the job, experience and mastery, and potential for advancement. Although we do not engage in benchmarking, the Compensation Committee may also consider compensation levels with comparable positions in the industry to evaluate the total compensation decisions that it makes for our officers. 
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee determines the compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, which is based on various factors, such as level of responsibility and contributions to our performance. Our Chief Executive Officer recommends the compensation for our executive officers (other than the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer) to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews the recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer and determines the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers. 
Say-on-Pay and Say-on-Frequency 
Stockholders voted at the 2015 annual stockholders meeting on the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation. The Company's Board of Directors has since evaluated the results of that non-binding advisory vote and made a determination as to whether the Company will submit  ​
future non-binding votes on executive compensation to the stockholders for consideration every one, two, or three years. A majority of the shares voted at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders on a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of named executive officers voted for the Company to hold votes every three years. In light of this result and after further discussion by the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors determined that the Company would hold non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of named executive officers every three years until the next required non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation. 
At the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's Say-on-Pay proposal passed with a majority of the stockholder advisory votes in favor of the Company's executive compensation program, which indicated to the Compensation Committee that stockholders were supportive of the Company's executive compensation design and strategy. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider Say-on-Pay results in the design of the Company's compensation program. 
Compensation Elements 
In general, our compensation program consists of base salary and certain equity-based incentive compensation awards. Our NEOs also receive certain other benefits as set forth in the employment agreements that we entered into with the NEOs. 
Base Salary 
The compensation to the NEOs contained base salary only for 2015, 2016 and 2017, subject to the provisions of the employment agreements that we entered into. 
Equity-Based Compensation 
Our primary stock-based employee compensation plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, was approved by our Board of Directors on March 24, 2011 and ratified by stockholders on October 31, 2011. This plan serves as the primary vehicle by which we offer long-term incentives and rewards to our executive officers and key employees. We regard the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan as a key retention tool. Retention serves as a very important factor in our determination of the type of award to grant and the number of underlying shares that are granted in connection with that award. 
Because of the direct relationship between the value of an option and the market price of our common stock, we believe that granting stock options is a superb method of motivating our executive officers and other key employees to manage our Company in a manner that is consistent with the interests of our Company and our stockholders. The exercise period under an option granted pursuant to our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan is subject to early termination in certain instances upon termination of the employment of a grantee. The exercise price of the options awarded pursuant to the plan is priced at the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant. Based on such exercise price and the other conditions of the award agreements to be entered into with qualifying employees under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, some options are intended to qualify as incentive stock options (under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). 
We grant option awards to our executive officers and key employees based upon prior performance, the importance of retaining their services and the potential for their performance to help us attain our long-term goals. However, there is no set formula for the granting of awards to individual executives or employees. Option awards generally reflect the Compensation Committee's assessment of the influence an employee's position has on stockholder value. The number of options awarded may vary up or down from prior year awards based on the level of an individual executive officer's contribution to the Company in a particular year, determined in part on the recommendation of the CEO. The Committee's determination of option grants in fiscal 2011 took into consideration a number of factors. These factors include past grants to the individual, total compensation level (relative to other executives and relative to market data), contributions to the Company during the last completed fiscal year, potential for contributions in the future, and as a component of competitive total compensation based on market data. The Compensation  ​
Committee also considers the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer in reviewing and approving the awards to executive officers and employees. Traditionally, our Compensation Committee meets in January or February of each year to determine option awards for our executive officers and key employees. 
In fiscal 2013, on July 16, 2013, our Compensation Committee approved the grant of stock options for the purchase, in the aggregate, of 90,000 shares of common stock to our non-employee directors (30,000 each). 25% of the options became exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date, and 6.25% of the options became or will become exercisable on the date three months after the initial vesting date, and on such date every third month thereafter, through the fourth anniversary of the grant date. The options have an exercise price of  $1.18 per share (the closing share price on the grant date). 
In fiscal 2015, on February 25, 2015, our Compensation Committee approved the grant of stock options for the purchase, in the aggregate, of 90,000 shares of common stock to our non-employee directors (30,000 each). 25% of the options became exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date, and 6.25% of the options became or will become exercisable on the date three months after the initial vesting date, and on such date every third month thereafter, through the fourth anniversary of the grant date. The options have an exercise price of  $1.11 per share (the closing share price on the grant date).

We do not have a formal bonus plan or profit sharing plan pursuant to which cash or non-cash compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers. Although we do not have a broad-based bonus plan, we may award bonuses on a case-by-case basis depending on the terms of specific employment agreements or other arrangements, our financial performance, as well as the executive's performance, which are determined by the Board in its sole discretion. There are no arrangements or plans under which we provide company-based pension, retirement, nonqualified deferred compensation or similar benefits for the NEOs or other executive officers.

Represents the amounts of base salary Mr. Jia was entitled to for his services as our CEO in the respective periods pursuant to his employment agreement with us. The amounts of annual compensation Mr. Jia actually received were substantially lower than the base salary provided in his employment agreement because Mr. Jia voluntarily waived most of his salary amounts in the respective periods.
​
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements that Messrs. Jia and Liu have with us, both executives are compensated by us for services provided to us and our subsidiary and consolidated affiliate, including Wuhan Vogue — Show Jewelry Co., Inc., or Vogue Show, and Wuhan Kingold Jewelry Company Limited, or Wuhan Kingold. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement that Mr. Jun Wang has with Wuhan Kingold, Mr. Wang is compensated by Wuhan Kingold for services provided to Wuhan Kingold, as well as its affiliates, including us and Vogue Show. 
Employment Agreements
We have entered into employment agreements with our senior executive officers, as described below. Copies of these employment agreements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to our registration statements, annual reports and other filings under applicable rules. Our Board may adjust base salaries annually to reflect increases in the cost of living, but it has not done so to date. An executive's base salary may also be increased if the executive's workload substantially increases as a result of our business expansion. In addition, an executive's base salary may be correspondingly adjusted if the salaries of all of our other employees are adjusted. 
Zhihong Jia. We entered into an employment agreement with Zhihong Jia, our chief executive officer, effective October 28, 2016, for a term of three years. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Jia receives annual compensation equal to $175,000. In addition, Mr. Jia's employment agreement provides for an annual bonus based on the executive's performance and our financial performance. Annual bonuses will be determined by us in our sole discretion and will be approved by our Compensation Committee. 
If Mr. Jia's employment agreement terminates as a result of death, we will pay Mr. Jia's beneficiaries or estate, as applicable, an amount equal to twenty-four months' base salary plus the full amount of any compensation to which the executive was entitled as of the date of termination. If we terminate Mr. Jia's employment based on the executive's disability, we will pay him an amount equal to eighteen months' base salary plus the full amount of any compensation to which he was entitled as of the date of termination. 
We may terminate Mr. Jia's employment agreement with cause (as defined in his employment agreement) at any time with three months written notice. If we dismiss Mr. Jia without cause (as defined in his employment agreement), or if he terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in his employment agreement), we will pay him the product of his monthly base salary and the number of years the executive was employed pursuant to his employment agreement plus twelve. If Mr. Jia terminates his employment other than for good reason, he will be entitled to a contribution bonus in an amount determined by us and approved by our Board. A contribution bonus shall not exceed the product of  ​
Mr. Jia's monthly base salary and the number of years the executive was employed pursuant to his employment agreement plus ten. If Mr. Jia's employment agreement expires in accordance with its term without earlier termination or extension, he will be eligible to receive an amount equal to twelve months' base salary. 
Our employment agreement with Mr. Jia provides for the protection of confidential information and contains non-competition and non-solicitation provisions applicable for a term of twelve months following the termination of his employment. Mr. Jia will continue to receive his monthly base salary during the term of the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions in consideration of his fulfilling his obligations thereunder. 
Bin Liu.   We entered into an employment agreement with Bin Liu, our CFO, effective April 1, 2010, for a term of three (3) years, which was subsequently amended on January 7, 2011. Pursuant to that agreement, Mr. Liu received annual compensation equal to $135,000. In addition, Mr. Liu was entitled to participate in any and all benefit plans, from time to time, in effect for employees, along with vacation, sick and holiday pay in accordance with policies established and in effect from time to time. Under the agreement, as amended, upon the first and second anniversary of his employment, Mr. Liu received an equity grant on each of April 1, 2011 and April 1, 2012 of an option to purchase 120,000 shares of our common stock. Each of the annual options granted vests quarterly at a rate of 30,000 options at the end of each three month period of employment. Mr. Liu's agreement was also amended to provide him with an increased relocation package of up to $150,000 given the additional and significant cost of living and related expenses Mr. Liu was to incur upon his relocation from Illinois to our New York office. In addition, Mr. Liu agreed that, during his employment with us and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, he would not directly or indirectly employ, solicit, or induce for employment or in any other fashion hire any of the senior management of the Company. Mr. Liu also agreed to a non-compete clause whereby he agreed not engage or assist others to engage in the business of designing and manufacturing gold jewelry for a one (1) year period following the end of his employment with us. This employment agreement terminated on April 1, 2013 in accordance with its terms and on April 2, 2013, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Liu on substantially the same terms. 
Mr. Liu's employment agreement is for a three (3) year term, and is retroactively effective to April 2, 2013 and was scheduled to terminate on April 2, 2016. Since April 2, 2016, Mr. Liu and the Company have continued to perform under the same terms as the then-effective agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Liu will receive annual compensation equal to $135,000, and is entitled to participate in any and all benefit plans, from time to time, in effect for employees, along with vacation, sick and holiday pay in accordance with policies established and in effect from time to time. In addition, we granted Mr. Liu 360,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. Mr. Liu also agreed to both a non-solicit and non-compete clause while employed and for a one (1) year period following the end of his employment. 
We may terminate Mr. Liu's employment agreement at any time without cause upon thirty (30) days' notice and the payment to Mr. Liu of a lump amount equal to three (3) months' salary which shall be paid upon termination. Mr. Liu may effect a voluntary termination of his employment agreement at any time upon sixty (60) days' notice to us; however, in such event no additional compensation will be due to Mr. Liu. We have the right to terminate Mr. Liu's employment agreement for cause (as defined in his employment agreement), in which event we will not have any further obligations or liability to Mr. Liu under his employment agreement subsequent to the actual date of termination. 
Jun Wang.   Effective as of May 1, 2014, our consolidated affiliate, Wuhan Kingold, has entered into an employment agreement with Jun Wang to serve as general manager for a term of five (5) years, unless terminated early by either party as provided in the agreement. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Wang will receive monthly compensation equal to RMB 12,000. We may terminate the employment agreement with Mr. Wang for cause (as described in his employment agreement), provided that we should inform the labor union of such cause of termination. In the event that Mr. Wang, due to sickness or injury inflicted off the job, cannot resume his work after specified period of medical treatment, or is unqualified after training or a job adjustment, or in the event that the objective conditions on which the employment agreement is based have materially changed to the extent that it is impossible to perform the employment  ​
agreement while we and Mr. Wang cannot reach an agreement to amend the employment agreement to reflect the changed conditions, we may terminate the employment agreement by providing thirty (30) days' notice, or pay additional one-month salary to Mr. Wang, subject to certain exceptions provided in the employment agreement.

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Jia, our CEO: 
For 2017, our last completed fiscal year: 
 the annual total compensation of the employee identified at median of our company (other than our CEO), was RMB 29,484 (approximately $4,531.54); and 
​
 the annual total compensation of the CEO for purposes of determining the CEO Pay Ratio was RMB 120,000 (approximately $18,443.38).
​
Based on this information, for 2017, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Jia, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was estimated to be 4.07 to 1. 
We believe this pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. Under the SEC rules, companies may identify their median compensated employees and calculate the pay ratios based on different methodologies, certain exclusions and reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio we calculated, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices or may utilize different methodologies, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we used the following methodologies, assumptions and estimates: we determined that, as of December 31, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 626 individuals, and we used actual base salary for the 12-month period then ended in identifying the "median employee." 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
We have no compensatory plan with respect to any officer that results or will result in the payment of compensation from the resignation, retirement or any other termination of such officer's employment with our company, from a change in control of our company or a change in such officer's responsibilities following a change in control, except for severance payments or certain other benefits that may be provided pursuant to the employment agreements with the NEOs. Mr. Jia is entitled, under his employment agreement, to severance payments and certain benefits in the event of termination. Mr. Liu is also entitled to certain payments upon certain terminations of employment pursuant to his employment agreement.
Director Compensation 
The following table sets forth a summary of our directors' compensation for fiscal year 2017 except for our employee directors. Mr. Zhihong Jia, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, did not receive any compensation for his board service beyond the compensation he received as the CEO of the Company. Mr. Jun Wang received his annual compensation of  $23,118 for his service as our General Manager, while he did not receive any compensation for his board service.

DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2019 
Stockholder proposals which are intended to be presented by such stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices no later than 120 calendar days in advance of the one year anniversary of the date our proxy statement was released to stockholders in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy/​voting instruction card relating to that meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Under the rules of the SEC, stockholders who wish to submit proposals for inclusion in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must submit such proposals to Kingold by July 12, 2019. However, if the date of our 2019 annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of this year's annual meeting of stockholders, then, to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to our 2019 annual meeting, notice of a stockholder proposal will need to be received by our Corporate Secretary in a reasonable amount of time before we begin to send our proxy materials for the 2019 annual meeting. 
Any proposal must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for such proposal to be included in our proxy statement. We reserve the right to exclude stockholder proposals pursuant to SEC rules, or if untimely. Stockholders continuously holding at least 1% or $2,000 in market value of the issued and outstanding shares of a class of our securities for at least one year are eligible to submit proposals or may nominate director candidates. If a stockholder nominates a director candidate, in order for such nomination to be valid and acceptable, all information required to be provided under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and requested by the board of directors (or Nominating Committee, if applicable) concerning such candidate must be furnished within a reasonable time prior to the above deadline for stockholder proposals. ​
OTHER MATTERS 
Our Board knows of no other matters to be submitted to the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, then the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote the shares they represent in their discretion. 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers, banks and nominees) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies and intermediaries. 
This year, a number of brokers, banks and nominees with account holders who are our stockholders may be householding our proxy materials. In such circumstances, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received by the broker, bank or nominee from one or more of the affected stockholders. We have not initiated householding with respect to the small number of our record holders, because such householding would increase our costs. If, at any time, you would like to receive a separate copy of our proxy statement and annual report, we will promptly send you an additional copy upon written or oral request directed to our Secretary. If you are a beneficial owner, you can request additional copies of the proxy statement and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. If your shares are held in "street name," you can request a change in your householding status by notifying your broker, bank or nominee. 
To the extent that this Proxy Statement is incorporated by reference into any other filing by us under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the sections of this Proxy Statement entitled "Compensation Committee Report" and "Audit Committee Report" (to the extent permitted by the rules of the SEC) will not be deemed incorporated unless specifically provided otherwise in such filing. 
The final results of the balloting at the Annual Meeting will appear in our Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the annual meeting.  ​
