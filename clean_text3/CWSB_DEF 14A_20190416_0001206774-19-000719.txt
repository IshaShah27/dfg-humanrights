 "The Board and our Risk Committee engage deeply in the oversight of risk management practices ….always recognizing that, while Citi is in the business of taking risk, these risks must be understood, measured, monitored, and controlled."  By most financial measures, 2018 for Citi was a year captured best by the phrase "steady progress." Consistent with the goals set forth in our Investor Day presentation almost two years ago, and adjusting for the one-time impact of U.S. Tax Reform, the firm increased its net income by 14 percent; increased its earnings per share by 25 percent; reduced operating expenses by one percent, driving down the operating efficiency ratio to 57 percent; generated continued growth in loans and deposits; and perhaps most important, increased its return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) to 10.9 percent. While the lower effective tax rate resulting from U.S. Tax Reform contributed substantially to these results, Citi's pre-tax earnings also increased modestly from the prior year. Despite this positive operating performance, Citi's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for 2018 disappointed, both absolutely and relative to peers. This was partly due to a general decline in bank share prices, exacerbated by an especially sharp decrease in December for banks with substantial market-making operations. While Citi's share price and relative TSR rebounded in the first part of this year, your Board remains very focused on Citi improving its TSR in 2019 and the years ahead – and we believe the best way for the firm to do this is to continue its steady progress, especially through improvement of its return on tangible common equity. Management also made progress on the regulatory front last year, which we believe is critical to the firm's success. Citi again achieved a successful result in the Federal Reserve's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test, enabling the return of over $18 billion of capital to common shareholders during the calendar year, while maintaining levels of regulatory capital well in excess of minimum requirements. In addition, Citi made headway on a range of heightened regulatory requirements that all large banks have faced in the wake of the financial crisis. Nevertheless, your Board will continue to pay close attention to – and expect management to make continued progress on – regulatory matters in 2019 and beyond. As it should be for a global firm like Citi, prudent risk management was top of mind for both management and the Board in 2018. Our three lines of defense – the business lines, the control functions, and internal audit – dove deeply and, where necessary, took proactive steps in critical risk areas such as Brexit, the potential fall-out from trade wars, evolving industry underwriting standards in leveraged lending, and the potential turn of the credit cycle. Cyber risk remains a crucial priority, and the firm has invested heavily to maintain state-of-the-art defenses and cyber resilience. The Board and our Risk Committee engage deeply in the oversight of risk management practices in these and other areas, always recognizing that, while Citi is in the business of taking risk, these risks must be understood, measured, monitored, and controlled. Much has been written about the ethical lapses that have damaged the reputation of the banking industry, including Citi, both during and after the financial crisis. We continue to believe that strong ethical standards and practices are critically important, which is why Citi, alone in the banking industry, maintains an Ethics and Culture Committee of the Board as one means to keep management striving to achieve best practices – not just at senior levels but throughout the organization.

  Citi also took firm stands in 2018 on several issues of real importance. On diversity and inclusion, we became the first financial services company to voluntarily disclose adjusted pay gaps between women and men in the United States, the U.K., and Germany, and between minorities and non-minorities in the U.S. – and then took concrete steps to eliminate those gaps. In response to the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S., we were the first bank to announce a Commercial Firearms Policy, which requires our retail sector clients to establish such best practices as background checks and age restrictions. And in our Sustainable Progress Initiative, the firm recorded $38.4 billion in transactions toward our 10-year, $100 billion Environmental Finance goal. The Board fully supported each of these measures.  Finally, at our annual review of strategy, which we conduct each year at our July meeting, we will examine closely management's plans to continue Citi's path forward to achieve increased sustainable returns; address challenges from potential disruptors; improve our operations and technology; increase our efficiency; and continue to prudently manage risk. Our focus: continued steady progress toward Citi's longer-term goal of a 16% RoTCE.  Thank you for your ongoing support of Citi. Dialogue with shareholders is a fundamental feature of a well governed organization, and we will continue to make it a priority. Please write with any concerns or suggestions to: Citigroup Inc. Board of Directors, c/o Rohan Weerasinghe, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, 388 Greenwich Street, New York, NY 10013.

 Implementing the TCFD Recommendations Citi continues to support the Paris Agreement and was an early supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which promotes greater understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities through better climate disclosures. Our adoption of the TCFD Recommendations builds on over two decades of work promoting sustainability. Climate change is a central focus of Citi's Sustainable Progress Strategy and we take action through strong governance, environmental financing, integration of climate risks into environmental and social risk management, and transparent reporting on climate-related metrics and targets. To pilot climate scenario analysis, Citi worked jointly with 15 other banks and the UN Environment Finance Initiative to develop new methodologies and tools for the assessment of transition and physical risks and opportunities within banks' lending portfolios. Citi piloted the transition risk methodology on our North American oil and gas exploration and production portfolio and the transition and physical risk methodologies on our U.S. utilities portfolio. We shared our process and findings in our first climate disclosure report, Finance for a Climate-Resilient Future, published in November 2018. By voluntarily adopting the TCFD framework, Citi is working to better understand our own climate risks and help navigate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Interlocking directorates are prohibited (inside Directors and executive officers of Citi may not sit on boards of companies where a Citi outside Director is an executive officer).
Change in Status or Responsibilities
If a Director has a substantial change in professional responsibilities, occupation, or business association, he or she is required to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and to offer his or her resignation from the Board. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will evaluate the facts and circumstances and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept the resignation or request that the Director continue to serve on the Board. If a Director assumes a significant role in a not-for-profit entity, he or she is asked to notify the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee.
Attendance at Meetings
Directors are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which they serve and the Annual Meeting of stockholders. All of the Directors then in office attended Citi's 2018 Annual Meeting.
Evaluation of Board Performance
The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee nominates one of the members of the Board to serve as Chair of the Board on an annual basis. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also conducts an annual review of Board performance in which the full Board participates, and each standing committee (except for the Executive Committee) conducts its own self-evaluation. As part of the self-evaluation, the Board engages in an examination of its own performance of its obligations with regards to such matters as regulatory requirements, strategic and financial oversight, oversight of risk management, executive compensation, succession planning, and governance matters, among many other topics. The committees evaluate their performance against the requirements of their charters and other aspects of their responsibilities. The full Board and each committee then discuss the results of their respective self-evaluations in executive session, highlighting actions to be taken in response to the discussion. See Board Self-Assessment Process on page 31 for further information.
Directors Access to Senior Management and Director Orientation
Directors have full and free access to senior management and other employees of Citi. New Directors are provided with an orientation program to familiarize them with Citi's businesses, regions, and functions as well as its legal, compliance, regulatory, and risk profile. Citi provides educational sessions on a variety of topics throughout the year for all members of the Board. These sessions are designed to allow Directors to, for example, develop a deeper understanding of a business issue or a complex financial product.
Succession Planning
The Board reviews the Personnel and Compensation Committee's report on the performance of senior executives in order to ensure that they are providing the highest quality leadership for Citi. The Board also works with the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee to evaluate potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). With respect to regular succession of the CEO and senior management, Citi's Board evaluates internal, and, when appropriate, external candidates. To find external candidates, Citi seeks input from the members of the Board and senior management and/or from recruiting firms. To develop internal candidates, Citi engages in
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents a number of practices, formal and informal, designed to familiarize the Board with Citi's talent pool. The formal process involves an annual talent review conducted by senior management at which the Board studies the most promising members of senior management. The Board learns about each person's experience, skills, areas of expertise, accomplishments, and goals. This review is conducted at a regularly scheduled Board meeting on an annual basis. In addition, members of senior management are periodically asked to make presentations to the Board at Board meetings and Board strategy sessions. These presentations are made by senior managers of the various business units as well as those who serve in corporate functions. The purpose of the formal review and other interaction is to ensure that Board members are familiar with the talent pool inside and outside Citi from which the Board would be able to choose successors to the CEO and evaluate succession for other senior managers as necessary from time to time.
Charitable Contributions
If a Director, or an immediate family member who shares the Director's household, serves as a director, trustee, or executive officer of a foundation, university, or other not-for-profit organization, and such entity receives contributions from Citi and/or the Citi Foundation, such contributions must be reported to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee at least annually.
Insider Investments and Transactions
 Members of Citi's Board of Directors and Citi's executive officers (i.e., Section 16 Insiders) are not permitted to hedge their Citi securities or to pledge their Citi securities as collateral for a loan. The Guidelines restrict certain financial transactions between Citi and its subsidiaries on the one hand and Directors, senior management, and their immediate family members on the other. Personal loans from Citi or its subsidiaries to Citi's Directors and its most senior executives, or immediate family members who share any such person's household, are prohibited, except for margin loans to employees of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi, mortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans, credit cards, and overdraft checking privileges, all made on market terms in the ordinary course of business. See Certain Transactions and Relationships, Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider Participation on pages 38-39  of this Proxy Statement.
The Guidelines prohibit investments or transactions by Citi or its executive officers and those immediate family members who share an executive officer's household in a partnership or other privately held entity in which an outside Director is a principal, or in a publicly traded company in which an outside Director owns or controls more than a 10% interest. Directors and those immediate family members who share the Director's household are not permitted to receive initial public offering allocations. Directors and their immediate family members may participate in Citi-sponsored investment activities, provided they are offered on the same terms as those offered to similarly situated non-affiliated persons. Under certain circumstances, or with the approval of the appropriate committee, members of senior management may participate in certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities. Finally, there is a prohibition on certain investments by Directors and executive officers in third-party entities when the opportunity comes solely as a result of their position with Citi.
Director Independence
The Board has adopted categorical standards to assist the Board in evaluating the independence of each of its Directors. The categorical standards, which are set forth below, describe various types of relationships that could potentially exist between a Director or an immediate family member of a Director and Citi, and set thresholds at which such relationships would be deemed to be material. Provided that no relationship or transaction exists that would disqualify a Director under the categorical standards and no other relationships or transactions exist of a type not specifically mentioned in the categorical standards that, in the Board's opinion, taking into account all facts and circumstances, would impair a Director's ability to exercise his or her independent judgment, the Board will deem such person to be independent.

Table of Contents
The Board and the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee reviewed certain information obtained from Directors' responses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships with Citi, and those of their immediate family members and primary business or charitable affiliations and other potential conflicts of interest, as well as certain data collected by Citi's businesses related to transactions, relationships, or arrangements between Citi on the one hand and a Director, immediate family member of a Director, or a primary business or charitable affiliation of a Director, on the other. The Board reviewed certain relationships or transactions between the Directors or immediate family members of the Directors or their primary business or charitable affiliations and Citi and determined that the relationships or transactions complied with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the related categorical standards. The Board also determined that, applying the Guidelines and standards, which are intended to comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules, and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations, each of the following Director nominees standing for re-election and current board members is independent:
The Board has determined that Mr. McQuade is independent because he retired from employment in May 2015, over three years ago. The Board has determined that Michael L. Corbat and Barbara Desoer are not independent. Mr. Corbat is our Chief Executive Officer and Ms. Desoer is the Chief Executive Officer of Citibank, N.A., our largest banking subsidiary. Ms. Desoer is scheduled to retire as the Chief Executive Officer of Citibank, N.A. before Citi's 2019 Annual Meeting.
Independence Standards
To be considered independent, a Director must meet the following categorical standards as adopted by our Board and reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition, there are other independence standards under NYSE corporate governance rules that apply to all directors and certain independence standards under SEC, Internal Revenue Code (IRC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) rules that apply to specific committees.

Immaterial Relationships and Transactions
The Board may determine that a Director is independent notwithstanding the existence of an immaterial relationship or transaction between Citi and (i) the Director, (ii) an immediate family member of the Director or (iii) the Director's or immediate family member's business or charitable affiliations, provided Citi's Proxy Statement includes a specific description of such relationship as well as the basis for the Board's determination that such relationship does not preclude a determination that the Director is independent. Relationships or transactions between Citi and (i) the Director, (ii) an immediate family member of the Director or (iii) the Director's or immediate family member's business or charitable affiliations that comply with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, including, but not limited to, the Director Independence Standards that are part of the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the sections titled Financial Services, Personal Loans and Investments/Transactions, are deemed to be categorically immaterial and do not require disclosure in the Proxy Statement (unless such relationship or transaction is required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K).
Definitions 
For purposes of these Corporate Governance Guidelines, (i) the term "immediate family member" means a Director's or executive officer's (designated as such pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) spouse, parents, step-parents, children, step-children, siblings, mother- and father-in law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and any person (other than a tenant or domestic employee) who shares the Director's household; (ii) the term "Primary Business Affiliation" means an entity of which the Director or executive officer, or an immediate family member of such a person, is an officer, partner or employee or in which the Director, executive officer or immediate family member owns directly or indirectly at least a 5% equity interest; and (iii) the term "Related Party Transaction" means any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship in which (a) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (b) Citi is a participant, and (c) any Related Person (any Director, any executive officer of Citi, any nominee for Director, any shareholder owning in excess of 5% of the total equity of Citi, and any immediate family member of any such person) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees
The Board of Directors met 20 times in 2018. During 2018, the Audit Committee met 21 times, the Ethics and Culture Committee met 4 times, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee met 10 times, the Operations and Technology Committee met 5 times, the Personnel and Compensation Committee met 13 times, and the Risk Management Committee met 13 times. In addition, a subcommittee of the Risk Management Committee met 9 times. The Executive Committee did not meet in 2018.
During 2018, substantially all of the members of the Board served on and/or chaired one or more ad hoc committees covering compliance matters or served on an international subsidiary board. In addition, during 2018, Mses. Costello and Ireland and Messrs. Hennes, McQuade, Santomero, and Turley, served on the Board of Directors of Citibank, N.A., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Citi.
Each incumbent Director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the standing committees of which he or she was a member during 2018.
Meetings of Non-Management Directors
Citi's non-management Directors meet in executive session without any management Directors in attendance whenever the full Board convenes for a regularly scheduled meeting. During 2018, Mr. O'Neill presided at each executive session of the non-management Directors. In addition, the independent Directors met in executive session during 2018.
Board Leadership Structure
Citi currently has an independent Chair separate from the CEO, a structure that has been in place since 2009. The Board believes it is important to maintain flexibility in its Board leadership structure and has had in place different leadership structures in the past, depending on the Company's needs at the time, but firmly supports having an independent Director in a Board leadership position at all times. Accordingly, Citi's Board, on December 15, 2009, adopted a By-law amendment which provides that if Citi does not have an independent Chair, the Board will elect a lead independent Director having similar duties to an independent Chair, including leading the executive sessions of the non-management Directors at Board meetings. Citi's Chair provides independent leadership of the Board. Having an independent Chair or Lead Director enables non-management Directors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration without immediately involving management. The Chair or Lead Director also serves as a liaison between the Board and senior management. Citi's Board has determined that the current structure, an independent Chair separate from the CEO, is the most appropriate structure at this time, while ensuring that, at all times, there will be an independent Director in a Board leadership position. The Board believes its approach to risk oversight, including, importantly, having a standing Risk Management Committee and the reporting line of the Chief Risk Officer to the Risk Management Committee, ensures that the Board can choose many leadership structures without experiencing a material impact on its oversight of risk.

Board Diversity
Diversity is among the critical factors that the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers when evaluating the composition of the Board. For a company like Citi, which operates in more than 100 countries around the globe, diversity includes race, ethnicity, and gender as well as the diversity of the communities and geographies in which Citi operates. Included in the qualifications for Directors listed in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines is "whether the candidate has special skills, expertise and background that would complement the attributes of the existing Directors, taking into consideration the diverse communities and geographies in which the Company operates." Citi's Board is committed to ensuring that it is composed of individuals whose backgrounds reflect the diversity represented by our employees, customers, and stakeholders. The candidates nominated for election at Citi's 2019 Annual Meeting exemplify that diversity: six nominees are women and three nominees are African-American or Hispanic. In addition, each Director candidate contributes to the Board's overall diversity by providing a variety of perspectives, personal and professional experiences, and backgrounds, as well as other characteristics, such as global and international business experience. The Board believes that the current nominees reflect an appropriate diversity of gender, age, race, geographical background, and experience and is committed to continuing to consider diversity issues in evaluating the composition of the Board.
Director Education Program
Citi has a robust Director Education Program that begins with an orientation for newly appointed Directors, providing two days of in-depth training covering all aspects of our business, including coverage of Citi's institutional and consumer businesses; financial reporting; an overview of the Company's risk management, audit, compliance, and legal functions; and an overview of Citi's primary banking subsidiary, Citibank, N.A. There is also a continuing education program, which includes presentations focusing on industry, regulatory and governance topics and presentations from the various lines of our business on emerging issues or strategic initiatives to provide our Directors with the opportunity to expand their insight into Citi's business operations and activities. Directors also have access to external programming and seminars to supplement their Citi-provided education.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board oversees Citi's global risk management framework.
www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents
At each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the Board receives a risk report from the Chief Risk Officer with respect to the Company's approach to management of major risks, including management's risk mitigation efforts, where appropriate. Global Risk Management, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is a company-wide function that is responsible for an integrated effort to identify, assess, and manage risks that may affect Citi's ability to execute on its corporate strategy and fulfill its business objectives. The Board's role is to oversee this effort.
The Risk Management Committee enhances the Board's oversight of risk management. The Committee's role is one of oversight, recognizing that management is responsible for executing Citi's risk management policies.
Board's Role in Cybersecurity Oversight
The Board of Directors provides oversight of management's efforts to address cybersecurity risk. The Board and various Committees receive periodic reports and engage in discussions throughout the year on the effectiveness of Citi's overall cybersecurity program, exploring Citi's inherent risks, the road map for addressing these risks, and Citi's progress in doing so. Board members receive contemporaneous reporting on any significant cyber events that may occur—which includes efforts at response, discussions of legal obligations, and the status of outreach to regulators—and provides guidance to management as appropriate.

Personnel and Compensation Committee 
Members:

Committee Meetings  in 2018: Charter:
The Personnel and Compensation Committee Charter is available on our website at www.citigroup.com. Click on "About Us," then "Corporate Governance," and then "Citigroup Board of Directors' Committee Charters." Committee Roles and Responsibilities: The Personnel and Compensation Committee has been delegated broad authority to oversee compensation of employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Committee regularly reviews Citi's management resources and performance of senior management. The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation for the CEO and approving the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and members of Citi's Operating Committee. The Committee is also responsible for approving the incentive compensation structure for other members of senior management and certain highly compensated employees (including discretionary incentive awards to covered employees as defined in applicable bank regulatory guidance), in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee from time to time. The Committee also has broad oversight of compliance with bank regulatory guidance governing Citi's incentive compensation. The Committee annually reviews and discusses the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required to be included in the Company's Proxy Statement with management, and, if appropriate, recommends to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included. Additionally, the Committee reviews and approves the overall goals of Citi's material incentive compensation programs, including as expressed through Citi's Compensation Philosophy, and provides oversight for Citi's incentive compensation programs so that they both (i) appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose Citi to imprudent risks, and (ii) are consistent with bank safety and soundness. Toward that end, the Committee meets periodically with Citi's Chief Risk Officer to discuss the risk attributes of Citi's incentive compensation programs. The Committee has the power to hire and fire independent compensation consultants, legal counsel, or financial or other advisors as it may deem necessary to assist it in the performance of its duties and responsibilities, without consulting or obtaining the approval of senior management of the Company. The Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook) to provide the Committee with advice on Citi's compensation programs for senior management. The amount paid to FW Cook in 2018 for advice on executive compensation matters is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 97 of this Proxy Statement.   The Board has determined that in addition to being independent according to the Board's independence standards as set out in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, each of the members of the Personnel and Compensation Committee is independent according to the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. Each of such Directors is a "non-employee Director," as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is an "outside Director," as defined by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
There are no legal proceedings to which any Director, officer, or The Vanguard Group (which owns more than 5% of Citi's common stock), or any affiliate thereof, is a party adverse to Citi or in which any such person has a material interest adverse to Citi. In lieu of participating in class action settlements of claims entered into by Citi and other banks relating to alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market, and which received final court approval in 2018, numerous BlackRock funds and other plaintiffs filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 7, 2018 against Citi and 15 other banks.  In this action, plaintiffs assert that defendants conspired to manipulate the foreign exchange market between 2003 and 2013.  BlackRock, Inc. owns more than 5% of Citi's common stock.
Certain Transactions and Relationships, Compensation Committee Interlocks, and Insider Participation
The Board has adopted a policy setting forth procedures for the review, approval, and monitoring of transactions involving Citi and related persons (Directors, Senior Managers, 5% stockholders, Immediate Family Member or Primary Business Affiliations). A copy of Citi's Policy on Related Party Transactions is available on our website at www.citigroup.com. Click on "About Us," then "Corporate Governance," and then "Citi Policies." Under the policy, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions involving related persons. Directors may not participate in any discussion or approval of a related party transaction in which he or she or any member of his or her immediate family is a related person, except that the Director must provide all material information concerning the related party transaction to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions valued at more than $50 million involving an executive officer or an Immediate Family Member of an executive officer. The Transaction Review Committee, composed of Citi's President, General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Head of Human Resources, is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions valued at less than $50 million involving an executive officer or an Immediate Family Member of an executive officer. The policy also contains a list of categories of transactions involving related persons that are pre-approved under the policy, and therefore need not be brought to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee or the Transaction Review Committee for approval.
The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the Transaction Review Committee will review the following information when assessing a related party transaction: 
Based on information contained in a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC, BlackRock and Vanguard reported that they beneficially owned 5% or more of the outstanding shares of Citi's common stock as of December 31, 2018 — see Stock Ownership — Owners of More than 5% of Citi Common Stock in this Proxy Statement on page 44. During 2018, our subsidiaries provided ordinary course lending, trading, and other financial services to BlackRock and Vanguard and their respective affiliates and clients. These transactions were entered into on an arm's length 
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents basis and contain customary terms and conditions and were on substantially the same terms as comparable transactions with unrelated third parties. Acciones y Valores Banamex, S.A. de C.V., Servicios Corporativos de Finanzas, S.A. de C.V., and Grupo Financiero Citibanamex, S.A. de C.V. ("Citibanamex") entered into an agreement with BlackRock, Inc. and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which BlackRock would acquire the asset management business of Citibanamex in Mexico. The transaction includes the sale of Impulsora de Fondos Banamex, S.A. de C.V., ("Impulsora") legal vehicle, and its advisory role for 52 mutual funds and certain managed account relationships, and certain intellectual property and vendor contracts required to operate the business. The closing for this transaction occurred in September 2018. Consideration for the sale consisted of $350 million and certain future payments if defined targets are met. In connection with the closing, Citibanamex and BlackRock also entered into a long-term distribution agreement to offer BlackRock asset management products to Citibanamex clients in Mexico. The agreement provides a framework under which Citibanamex would distribute BlackRock products in Mexico and includes terms relating to pricing, preferential access, and product support. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee reviewed the terms of the sale and approved the transaction in accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy. Based on information contained in a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC, BlackRock reported that it beneficially owns more than 5% of Citi's common stock.
Citi has established funds in which employees have invested. In addition, certain of our executive officers have from time to time invested their personal funds directly, or directed that funds for which they act in a fiduciary capacity be invested, in funds arranged by Citi's subsidiaries on the same terms and conditions as the other outside investors in these funds, who are not our executive officers, or employees. Other than certain "grandfathered" investments, in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate Governance Guidelines, executive officers may invest in certain Citi-sponsored investment opportunities only under certain circumstances and with the approval of the appropriate committee. In 2018, there were no distributions from the funds that require disclosure.
In 2018, Citi performed corporate banking and securities brokerage services in the ordinary course of our business for certain organizations in which some of our Directors are officers or directors. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Citi may use the products or services of organizations in which some of our Directors are officers or directors.
The persons listed on page 98 of this Proxy Statement are the current members of the Personnel and Compensation Committee. No current or former member of the Personnel and Compensation Committee was a part of a "compensation committee interlock" during fiscal year 2018 as described under SEC rules. In addition, none of our executive officers served as a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity that would constitute a "compensation committee interlock." No member of the Personnel and Compensation Committee had any material interest in a transaction with Citi or is a current or former officer of Citi, and no member of the Personnel and Compensation Committee is a current employee of Citi or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, no member of the Board, or any immediate family member of the Board, engaged FW Cook for any compensation-related services in 2018.
Mr. Corbat has entered into an Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement with Citigroup Inc. that allows him to reimburse Citi for the cost of his personal use of corporate aircraft based on the aggregate incremental cost of the flight to Citi. Aggregate incremental cost is calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent service or, if higher, the charge allowed under Federal Aviation Regulation 91.501(d). Mr. Corbat reimbursed Citi $223,132 related to his personal use of corporate aircraft during 2018.
An adult child of Mr. Humer, a Director, has been employed by Citi since 2010 and is currently employed by Citi's Institutional Clients Group. He received 2018 compensation of $951,239.

Indebtedness
Other than certain "grandfathered" margin loans, in accordance with Sarbanes-Oxley and the Citi Corporate Governance Guidelines, no margin loans may be made to any executive officer unless such person is an employee of a broker-dealer subsidiary of Citi and such loan is made in the ordinary course of business.
Certain transactions in excess of $120,000 involving loans, deposits, credit cards, and sales of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and other money market instruments and certain other banking transactions occurred during 2018 between Citibank, N.A. and other Citi banking subsidiaries on the one hand, and certain Directors or executive officers of Citi, members of their immediate families, corporations or organizations of which any of them is an executive officer or partner or of which any of them is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of securities, or associates of the Directors, the executive officers or their family members, on the other. The transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, that prevailed at the time for comparable transactions with other persons not related to the lender and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. Personal loans made to any Director or an executive officer must comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, Regulation O, and the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and must be made in the ordinary course of business.
Business Practices Committees
The business practices committees, which are composed of our most senior executives, provide the guidance necessary for Citi's business practices to meet the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical behavior consistent with Citi's Mission and Value Proposition. The business practices committees for the corporate level and each of Citi's businesses and regions review business activities, transactions, sales practices, product design, potential conflicts of interest, and other franchise or reputational risk issues escalated to these committees.
Business practices concerns may be raised through a variety of sources, including business practices working groups, other in-business committees, or the control functions. Relevant issues from the business practices committees are reported on a regular basis to the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board.
Ethics and Culture
At Citi, our mission is to serve as a trusted partner to our clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable growth and economic progress.
We foster a culture of ethics through our governance framework, programs and efforts that embed our culture and expectations for behavior throughout the organization, and collaboration with key stakeholders outside Citi to improve Citi's and the banking industry's culture.
Governance over Culture
The cornerstone of our approach to culture is our governance framework, which begins with a strong "tone from the top" starting with the Citigroup Board of Directors. In 2014, Citi's Board established a standing Ethics and Culture Committee of the Board to oversee senior management's ongoing efforts to foster a culture of ethics throughout Citi. For more information, please see the Ethics and Culture Committee Charter, which is set forth on Citi's website at www.citigroup.com.

Programs and Efforts that Embed Culture
To promote ethical conduct and enhance Citi's culture, Citi focuses on empowering individuals by establishing global policies, programs, and processes that embed our values throughout the organization and guide and support our employees in making ethical decisions and adhering to Citi's standards of conduct. Under the oversight of and with input and feedback from the Ethics and Culture Committee, senior management has prioritized a number of efforts to further embed our values and conduct expectations into the organization. The following are a few examples of our programs and associated efforts to set, reinforce, and embed our culture at Citi:
Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals
The Citi Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals applies to Citi's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), Controller (Principal Accounting Officer), and all finance professionals and administrative staff in a finance role, including Controllers, Finance & Risk Shared Services, Finance and Risk Infrastructure, Financial Planning & Analysis and Strategy, Treasury, Tax, M&A, Investor Relations, and the Regional/Business teams. Citi expects all of its employees to act in accordance with the highest standards of personal and professional integrity in all aspects of their activities, to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, to deter wrongdoing, and abide by the Citi Code of Conduct and other policies and procedures adopted by Citi that govern the conduct of its employees. The Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals is intended to supplement the Citi Code of Conduct. A copy of the Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals is available on our website at www.citigroup.com. Click on "About Us," then "Corporate Governance," and then "Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals." We will disclose amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals, if any, on our website.
Ethics Hotline
Citi expects employees to raise concerns or questions regarding ethics, discrimination or harassment matters, and to promptly report suspected violations of law, regulation, rule, or breaches of Citi policy, procedure, standard, or the Citi Code of Conduct. Citi offers several channels by which employees and others may report ethical concerns, including concerns about accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters. We provide a global Ethics Hotline, a toll-free number that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and is staffed by live operators who can connect to translators to accommodate multiple languages.

Calls to the Ethics Hotline are received by a third-party vendor, located in the United States, which reports the calls to the Citi Ethics Office for handling. Ethical concerns may also be reported through a dedicated e-mail address, multilingual website submission, fax line, and conventional mailing address. Any individual may also raise a concern by accessing Citi's public-facing corporate website. Individuals may choose to remain anonymous to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. We prohibit retaliatory actions against anyone who raises concerns or questions in good faith, or who participates in a subsequent investigation of such concerns. The Ethics Office reports on concerns it receives via the Citi Ethics Hotline to the Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank, N.A. on a quarterly basis.
Code of Conduct
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct, which provides an overview of the laws, regulations, and Citi policies and procedures applicable to the activities of Citi, and sets forth Citi's Mission and Value Proposition, as well as the standards of ethics and professional behavior expected of employees and representatives of Citi. The Code of Conduct applies to every director, officer, and employee of Citi and its consolidated subsidiaries. All Citi employees, directors, and officers are required to read and comply with the Code of Conduct. In addition, other persons performing services for Citi may be subject to the Code of Conduct by contract or other agreement.

Stock Ownership
Citi has long encouraged stock ownership by its Directors, officers, and employees to align their interests with the long-term interests of stockholders. The Board and executive officers are subject to a stock ownership commitment, which requires these individuals to maintain a minimum ownership level of Citigroup stock. Executive officers are required to retain at least 75% of the equity awarded to them as incentive compensation (net of amounts required to pay taxes and option exercise prices) as long as they are executive officers. In addition, a stock holding period applies after the executive officer leaves Citi, or is no longer an executive officer. He or she must retain, for one year after ending executive officer status, 50% of the shares previously subject to the stock ownership commitment. Directors are similarly required to retain at least 75% of the net equity awarded to them, further aligning their interests with stockholders. The Board may revise the terms of the stock ownership commitment from time to time to reflect legal and business developments warranting a change. In addition, Directors and executive officers may not enter into hedging transactions in respect of Citi's common stock or other securities issued by Citi, including securities granted by the Company to the Director or executive officer as part of his or her compensation and securities purchased or acquired by the Director or executive officer in a non-compensatory transaction.
The following table shows the beneficial ownership of Citi common stock by our Directors, nominee, named executive officers, current CFO, and Directors and executive officers as a group at February 23, 2019. For purposes of this table, "beneficial ownership" is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, pursuant to which a person, or group of persons, is deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of any shares of common stock that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days of the date of determination.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Citi's Section 16 officers and Directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of Citi's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE, and to furnish Citi with copies of the forms. Based on its review of the forms it received, or written representations from reporting persons, Citi believes that, during 2018, each of its Section 16 officers and Directors complied with all such filing requirements.
Proposal 1: Election of Directors
The Board has nominated all of the current Directors for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, except for Mr. Humer and Mr. Santomero, who will not stand for re-election to the Board having reached the retirement age under Citi's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Directors are not eligible to stand for re-election after reaching the age of 72. Mr. O'Neill retired from the Board on January 1, 2019 having reached the retirement age. Mr. Santomero will retire from the Board on April 1, 2019 and Mr. Humer will retire from the Board on April 16, 2019. Mr. Jacobs was elected by the Board in June 2018. Mr. Jacobs was identified as a potential Director by Egon Zehnder, the Board's nominating consultant and by a retired Board member. In addition, the Board has nominated Ms. Desoer for election to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Ms. Desoer was recommended as a candidate for election to the Citigroup Board by her fellow directors on the Citibank Board, all of whom are members of Citi's Board. If elected, each nominee will hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting or until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
Director Criteria and Nomination Process
The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee considers all qualified candidates identified by members of the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee, by other members of the Board, by senior management, and by security holders. During 2018, the Committee engaged Egon Zehnder to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. Stockholders who would like to propose a Director candidate for consideration by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee may do so by submitting the candidate's name, résumé, and biographical information to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, Rohan Weerasinghe, Citigroup Inc., 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. All proposals for nominations received by the Corporate Secretary will be presented to the Committee for its consideration.
In considering the composition of the Board of Directors, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee inventories the categories of risks faced by Citi, given its size, business mix, and geographical presence, and seeks to identify candidates with the skills and experience necessary to enable the Board of Directors to provide proper oversight of those risks. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee also takes Director tenure into consideration when making Director nomination decisions and believes that it is desirable to maintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced Directors and newer Directors with fresh perspectives. The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board also believe that longer-tenured, experienced Directors are a significant strength of the Board, given the large size of our Company, the breadth of our product offerings, and the international scope of our organization. The Board's composition, and the individuals nominated for consideration by stockholders, are the result of careful consideration by the Committee of the correspondence between the risk inventory and skills and experience of the Board members and candidates. In addition to the ability www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents to assist the Board in its oversight of a particular risk or risks, as more fully described in each nominee's biography, the members of the Board are assessed based on a variety of factors, including the following criteria, which have been developed by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and approved by the Board:
Application of these factors involves the exercise of judgment by the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee and the Board.
Based on its assessment of each candidate's independence, skills and qualifications and the criteria described above, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee will make recommendations regarding potential Director candidates to the Board.
The Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee follows the same process and uses the same criteria for evaluating candidates proposed by stockholders, members of the Board of Directors, and members of senior management. For the 2019 Annual Meeting, Citi did not receive notice from any stockholders regarding a nomination to the Board of Directors.
Director Qualifications
The nominees for the Board of Directors each have the qualifications and experience to approve and guide Citi's strategy and to oversee management's execution of that strategic vision. Citi's Board of Directors consists of individuals with the skills, experience, and backgrounds necessary to oversee Citi's efforts toward becoming a simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger financial institution, while mitigating risk and operating within a complex financial and regulatory environment.
The nominees listed below are leaders in business, the financial community, and academia because of their intellectual acumen and analytic skills, strategic vision, ability to lead and inspire others to work with them, and records of outstanding accomplishments over a period of decades. Each has been chosen to stand for election in part because of his or her ability and willingness to ask difficult questions, understand Citi's unique challenges, and evaluate the strategies proposed by management, as well as their implementation.

Each of the nominees has a long record of professional integrity, a dedication to his or her profession and community, a strong work ethic that includes a commitment to coming fully prepared to meetings and being willing to spend the time and effort needed to fulfill professional obligations and the ability to maintain a collegial environment.
Many of our nominees are either current or former chief executive officers or chairs of other large international corporations or have experience operating large, complex academic or governmental departments. As such, they have a deep understanding of, and extensive experience in, many of the areas that are outlined below as being of critical importance to Citi's proper operation and success. For the purposes of its analysis, the Board has determined that nominees who have served as a chief executive officer or a chair of a major corporation or large, complex institution have extensive experience with financial statement preparation, compensation determinations, regulatory compliance (if their businesses are or were regulated), corporate governance, public affairs, and legal matters.
In evaluating the composition of the Board, the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee seeks to find and retain individuals who, in addition to having the qualifications set forth in Citi's Corporate Governance Guidelines, have the skills, experience and abilities necessary to meet Citi's unique needs as a highly regulated financial services company with operations in the corporate and consumer businesses within the United States and more than 100 countries around the globe. The Committee has determined it is critically important to Citi's proper operation and success that its Board has, in addition to the qualities described above, expertise and experience in the following areas:
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Citi's Personnel and Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of the CEO and approving the compensation of other executive officers of the Company and members of Citi's Operating Committee. In order to properly carry out its responsibilities with respect to compensation, Citi's Board must include members who have experience evaluating the structure of compensation for senior executives. They must understand the various forms of compensation that can be utilized, the purpose of each type and how various elements of compensation can be used to motivate and reward executives and drive performance, while not encouraging imprudent risk-taking or simply having short-term goals. 
    With more than 200 million customer accounts, Citi provides services to its retail customers in connection with its retail banking, private banking, credit cards, real estate lending, personal loans, investment services, small- and middle-market commercial banking, and other financial services. Citi looks to its Board members with extensive consumer experience to assist it in evaluating its business model and strategies for reaching and servicing its retail customers domestically and around the world. Citi is a global diversified bank whose businesses provide a broad range of financial services to consumer and institutional customers, making it critically important that its Board include members who have deep financial services backgrounds. 
    Citi's reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its clients and other stakeholders, and Citi makes every effort to communicate its corporate values to its stockholders and clients, its achievements in the areas of corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and philanthropy, and its efforts to improve the communities in which we live and work. Members of the Board with experience in the areas of corporate affairs, philanthropy, community development, communications, and corporate social responsibility assist management by reviewing Citi's policies and programs that relate to significant public issues, including environmental, social and governance factors, as well as by reviewing Citi's relationships with external stakeholders and issues that impact Citi's reputation.

         Citi aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and ethical conduct: doing what we say, reporting results with accuracy and transparency, and maintaining compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations that govern the Company's businesses. The Board is responsible for shaping corporate governance policies and practices, including adopting the corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company and monitoring the Company's compliance with governance policies and the guidelines. To carry out these responsibilities, the Board must include experienced leaders in the area of corporate governance who must be familiar with governance issues, the constituencies most interested in those issues, and the impact that governance policies have on the functioning of a company. 
    Citi's internal controls over financial reporting are designed to ensure that Citi's financial reporting and its financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. While the Board and its committees are not responsible for preparing our financial statements, they have oversight responsibility, including the selection of outside independent auditors, subject to stockholder ratification, and lead engagement partner. The Board must include members with direct or supervisory experience in the preparation of financial statements, as well as finance, audit, and accounting expertise. 
    Citi provides a wide variety of services to its corporate clients, including strategic and financial advisory services, such as mergers, acquisitions, financial restructurings, loans, foreign exchange, cash management, underwriting and distributing equity, and debt and equity derivative services, markets and securities services, retail structured products, liquidity management, treasury and trade solutions and securities and fund services. With a corporate business as extensive and complex as Citi's, it is crucial that members of the Board have the depth of understanding and experience necessary to guide management's conduct of these lines of business. 
    As a company with a broad international reach, Citi's Board values the perspectives of Directors with international business or governmental experience or expertise in global economics. Citi's presence in markets outside the United States is an important competitive advantage for Citi, because it allows us to serve U.S. and foreign businesses and individual clients whose activities span the globe. Directors with international business experience can use the experience that they have developed through their own business dealings to assist Citi's Board and management in understanding and successfully navigating the business, political, and regulatory environments in countries in which Citi does or seeks to do business. Directors with global economics expertise can help guide Citi management in understanding the challenges faced by other markets and in developing its global strategy. 
    In addition to the regulatory supervision described below, Citi is subject to myriad laws and regulations and is party to legal actions and regulatory proceedings from time to time. Citi's Board has an important oversight function with respect to compliance with applicable requirements, monitors the progress of legal proceedings, and evaluates major settlements. Citi's Board must include members with experience in regulatory compliance, as well as an understanding of complex litigation and litigation strategies.

         Citi has a long history as a technology innovator—Citibank, N.A. was one of the first banks to offer automatic teller machines for its customers during the 1970s. Since then, Citi has continued to leverage new technologies to deliver enhanced products and services to its clients and customers such as online banking, mobile and tablet banking, and mobile check deposit. In addition, Citi deploys new technology and platform innovations to gather, process, analyze, and provide information to execute transactions and meet the needs of its clients and customers. In this context, Citi must be able to access reliable data to ensure that it complies with regulatory requirements, including anti-money laundering and sanctions, and to meet other information security and control objectives. Citi must ensure that its operations are efficient and there is a continuous focus on enhancing productivity to meet its operational and strategic goals. The Board must include members who have knowledge and experience in technology, including such technology-centric issues as cybersecurity, data privacy and data management, and the changing supervisory and regulatory technology landscape. Members of the Board must be qualified to provide oversight of the development and maintenance of Citi's technology platforms; Citi's compliance with regulatory requirements; Citi's operational efficiency and productivity strategies; the operations and reliability of Citi's systems; and the protection of client and customer data. 
    Citi and its subsidiaries are regulated and supervised by numerous regulatory agencies, both domestically and internationally, including in the U.S. the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and state banking and insurance departments, as well as international financial services authorities. Having Directors with experience interacting with regulators or operating businesses subject to extensive regulation is important to furthering Citi's continued compliance with its many regulatory requirements and fostering productive relationships with its regulators. Several of Citi's Board members have experience with ethics and compliance and building an effective, values-based ethics and compliance program. 
    Risk management is a critical function of a complex global financial services company and its proper supervision requires Board members with sophisticated risk management skills and experience. Directors provide oversight of the Company's risk management framework, including the significant policies, procedures, and practices used in managing credit, market, and certain other risks, including liquidity, capital, and balance sheet risks, as well as capital markets risks, and review recommendations by management regarding risk mitigation. Given increased cybersecurity threats, Citi's Board must have members who have sufficient experience to enable them to oversee management's efforts to monitor, detect and prevent cyber threats to Citi. Citi's Board must include members with risk expertise to assist Citi in its efforts to properly identify, measure, monitor, report, analyze, and control or mitigate risk.

Directors' Compensation
The key objectives of our Director Compensation Program are to attract qualified talent, provide pay that is commensurate with the substantial time commitment associated with service, and to foster commonality of interest between Board members and our stockholders.
Directors' compensation is determined by the Board and the Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee makes recommendations to the Board based on periodic benchmarking assessments and advice received from FW Cook, its independent advisor. In making recommendations to the Board, the Committee considers the competitive positioning of the aggregate and individual components of compensation, as well as the mix of pay and structure versus both direct competitors and other comparable organizations. The Committee also considers the unique skill set required to serve on our Board and the intense time commitment associated with preparation for and attendance at meetings of the Board and its committees as well as external commitments, such as engagement with our stockholders and regulators. Since our initial public offering in 1986, Citi has paid outside Directors all or a portion of their compensation in common stock to ensure that the Directors have an ownership interest in common with other stockholders.
In 2018, FW Cook provided benchmarking assessments and advice on peer and broad market practices. After considering the assessments and advice as well as the factors described above, the Committee determined that the current Director Compensation Program payment structure was appropriate.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Cash Retainer and Deferred Stock Award 
 Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer of $75,000 and a deferred stock award valued at $150,000. The deferred stock award is generally granted on the same date that annual incentives are granted to the senior executives. The deferred stock award generally becomes distributable on the second anniversary of the date of the grant, and Directors may elect to defer receipt of the award beyond that date. In the event a Director leaves the Board voluntarily prior to the conclusion of the two-year deferral period and before attaining age 72, the deferred stock award will be pro-rated based on the number of calendar quarters the Director served. Directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their cash retainer in the form of common stock, and Directors may elect to defer receipt of this common stock.

 Chair Compensation 
 Citi's Chair receives annual compensation in the form of a $500,000 Chair Fee, the amount of which was set by the Board in 2012 in recognition of the significant commitment of time and energy required to serve as Citi's Chair. This Fee is in addition to the Retainer and the Deferred Stock Award payable to all Directors, as well as any relevant Committee Chair and/or Committee Fees. Throughout his term as Chair, Mr. O'Neill, our prior Chair, waived receipt of any compensation other than the Chair Fee, which was payable 75% in deferred shares of Citi common stock and 25% in cash or deferred shares of Citi common stock. The three elements of Chair compensation for our new Chair, Mr. Dugan – the Chair Fee, the Retainer and Deferred Stock Award, and Committee Fees – remain unchanged from prior practice except regarding the mix of cash and equity in the Chair Fee; specifically, beginning in 2019, the Chair Fee is payable 50% in deferred shares of Citi's common stock and 50% in cash or deferred shares of Citi's common stock. Mr. Dugan has agreed to accept the first two elements of Chair compensation, which consist of the Chair Fee of $500,000 and the Retainer and Deferred Stock Award of $225,000 that all Directors receive. However, while Mr. Dugan will actively participate in the four Board Committees of which he is a member – Audit; Nomination, Governance and Public Affairs; Personnel and Compensation; and Risk Management – and will attend as many meetings of Citi's other Committees as is feasible, he has determined to waive the Committee Fees to which he is otherwise entitled. His total annual compensation therefore is $725,000, which the Board believes is appropriate in reflection of the evolving role of the Chair and the virtually full-time nature of the Chair's responsibilities. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered many factors including Mr. Dugan's extensive experience and knowledge of the regulatory environment, the expected time commitment attributable to both internal and external responsibilities, and the compensation paid for similar roles among direct competitors, including U.S. and non-U.S. banks as well as other high-profile global organizations.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee ("Committee") operates under a charter that specifies the scope of the Committee's responsibilities and how it carries out those responsibilities.
The Board of Directors has determined that all seven members of the Committee are independent based upon the standards adopted by the Board, which incorporate the independence requirements under applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the system of internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, risk management and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. KPMG LLP, Citigroup's independent registered public accounting firm ("independent auditors") is responsible for the integrated audit of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and procedures. The members of the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and are not professionals in these fields. The Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to us and on the representations made by management regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Committee also relies on the opinions of the independent auditors on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
The Committee's meetings facilitate communication among the members of the Committee, management, the internal auditors, and Citigroup's independent auditors. The Committee separately met with each of the internal and independent auditors with and without management, to discuss the results of their examinations and their observations and recommendations regarding Citigroup's internal controls. The Committee also discussed with Citigroup's independent auditors all communications required by PCAOB Auditing Standard Nos. 1301 and 2410.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of Citigroup as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management, the internal auditors, and Citigroup's independent auditors.
The Committee has received the written disclosures required by PCAOB Rule 3526 - "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence." The Committee discussed with the independent auditors any relationships that may have an impact on their objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to the auditors' independence.
The Committee has reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid to the independent auditors for audit, audit related and tax compliance and other services. The Committee concluded that the provision of services by the independent auditors did not impair their independence.
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions, and subject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities described above and in the Committee charter, the Committee recommended to the Board that Citigroup's audited consolidated financial statements be included in Citigroup's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Proposal 2: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP (KPMG) as the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi for 2019. KPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969.
Arrangements have been made for representatives of KPMG to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. The representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.
Disclosure of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
The following is a description of the fees earned by KPMG for services rendered to Citi for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
Audit Fees
This includes fees earned by KPMG in connection with the annual integrated audits of Citi's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404, audits of subsidiary financial statements, comfort letters and consents related to SEC registration statements and other capital-raising activities and certain reports relating to Citi's regulatory filings, reports on internal control reviews required by regulators, evaluation of accounting for completed transactions, and reviews of Citi's interim financial statements.
Audit-Related Fees
This includes fees for services performed by KPMG that are closely related to audits and in many cases could only be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Such services may include accounting consultations, internal control reviews not required by regulators, securitization-related services, employee benefit plan audits, certain attestation services as well as certain agreed upon procedures, and due diligence services related to contemplated mergers and acquisitions.
Tax Fees
This includes preparation and review of corporate tax returns, expense allocation reports for tax purposes, and other tax compliance services.
All Other Fees
Citi engaged KPMG for one service in 2018 classified under "All Other Fees." The aggregate fee amount of $11,400 is included in the total amount; however, due to rounding, this fee is not represented in the "All Other Fees" column.
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Approval of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Services and Fees
Citi's Audit Committee has reviewed and approved all fees earned in 2018 and 2017 by Citi's independent registered public accounting firm and actively monitored the relationship between audit and non-audit services provided. The Audit Committee has concluded that the fees earned by KPMG were consistent with the maintenance of the external auditors' independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.
The Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided and fees earned by Citi's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee annually considers the provision of audit services and, if appropriate, pre-approves certain defined audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax-compliance fees with specific dollar-value limits for each category of service. The Audit Committee also considers on a case-by-case basis specific engagements that are not otherwise pre-approved (e.g., internal control and certain tax compliance engagements) or that exceed pre-approved fee amounts. On an interim basis, any proposed engagement that does not fit within the definition of a pre-approved service may be presented to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval and to the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting.
The Accounting Firm Engagement Standard is the primary basis upon which management ensures the independence of its independent registered public accounting firm. Administration of the Standard is centralized in, and monitored by, Citi senior corporate financial management, which reports the engagements earned by KPMG throughout the year to the Audit Committee. The Standard also includes limitations on the hiring of KPMG partners and other professionals to ensure that Citi satisfies applicable auditor independence rules.
KPMG has served as the independent registered public accounting firm of Citi and its predecessors since 1969. As in prior years, Citi and its Audit Committee have engaged in a review of KPMG in connection with the Audit Committee's consideration of whether to recommend that stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as Citi's independent auditor for the following year. In that review, the Audit Committee considers both the continued independence of KPMG and whether retaining KPMG is in the best interests of Citi and its stockholders. Citi's management prepares an annual assessment of KPMG for the Audit Committee that includes (i) the results of a management survey of KPMG's overall performance; (ii) an analysis of KPMG's known legal risks and significant proceedings that may impair KPMG's ability to perform Citi's annual audit; and (iii) KPMG's fees and services provided to Citi both on an absolute basis, noting, of course, that KPMG does not provide any non-audit services, other than those described in the Proxy Statement, to Citi, and compared to services provided by other auditing firms to peer institutions. In addition, KPMG reviews with the Audit Committee its analysis of its independence in accordance with the Accounting Firm Engagement Standard and PCAOB Rule 3526. In performing its analysis, the Audit Committee considered the length of time KPMG has been Citi's independent auditor, the breadth and complexity of Citi's business and its global footprint and the resulting demands placed on its auditing firm in terms of expertise in Citi's businesses, the quantity and quality of staff, and global reach. The Audit Committee recognized the ability of KPMG to provide both the necessary expertise to audit Citi's business and the matching global footprint to audit Citi worldwide and other factors, including the policies that KPMG follows with respect to rotation of the key audit personnel, so that there is a new partner-in-charge at least every five years. Citi's Audit Committee oversees the process for, and ultimately approves, the selection of the independent auditor's lead engagement partner at the five-year mandatory rotation period. At the Audit Committee's instruction, KPMG selects candidates to be considered for the lead engagement partner role, who are then interviewed by members of Citi's senior management. After considering the candidates recommended by KPMG, senior management makes a recommendation to the Audit Committee regarding the new lead engagement partner. After discussing the qualifications of the proposed lead engagement partner with the current lead engagement partner and senior leadership of KPMG, the members of the Audit Committee, individually and/ or as a group, interview the leading candidate. The Audit Committee then considers the appointment and votes as an Audit Committee on the selection. The Audit Committee also reviewed external data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and its peer firms. Based on the results of its review this year, the Audit Committee concluded that KPMG is independent and that it is in the best interests of Citi and its investors to appoint KPMG to serve as Citi's independent registered accounting firm for 2019.

Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Citi's 2018 Executive Compensation
We are seeking a nonbinding, advisory vote approving the compensation of Citi's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, as required by Section 14A and Rule 14a-21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We ask for this advisory vote annually. You are asked to vote on the following nonbinding advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Citi's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.

2018 Financial Objectives
During our outreach to stockholders, we heard that they wanted disclosure of performance against goals used in our executive scorecards to better understand company performance. Accordingly, the chart to the right shows how Citi performed in 2018 against the principal goals we set for our executives in their scorecards. We set each 2018 goal at a level that exceeded the achievement in 2017, reflecting the challenging nature of our goals.
Relative Total Shareholder Return
The group of companies shown in the following graphs is our compensation peer group. As explained on page 83, we believe this group reflects the competitive market for talent in certain key roles, including the CEO role. While our relative total shareholder returns declined from 2017 to 2018, primarily as a result of deterioration in December 2018, one- and three-year relative stock performance through November 2018 and more recent performance in 2019 are more aligned with the stronger returns for periods ending on December 31, 2017.

Our Stockholder Engagement
Our current executive compensation program reflects extensive stockholder engagement over the past three years. Throughout this period, the Compensation Committee and management undertook a comprehensive review of our executive compensation program, and as part of this process, we held meetings with each stockholder who accepted our invitation to engage.
In 2018, we held two sets of stockholder outreach meetings with holders of meaningful percentages of our outstanding shares, given the size of our shareholder base.
We were pleased with the positive feedback from our stockholders and their endorsement of our executive compensation program, which resulted in a 94.58% favorable Say on Pay vote at our 2018 Annual Meeting. In response to this favorable result, we kept the core structure of our pay program and our disclosure consistent with last year. We also increased the performance targets in the Performance Share Units awarded for 2018 performance over prior-year targets and prior-year performance to reflect our improving performance and to further align the program with stockholder interests.
OUR STOCKHOLDER-RESPONSIVE EXECUTIVE PAY PROGRAM
As set forth below, all the material features of our executive compensation program are designed to be aligned with stockholder interests and in most cases are directly responsive to stockholder feedback we have received during the past three years.
www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents
Compensation Philosophy and Framework
We seek to design our executive pay program to motivate balanced behaviors, consistent with our focus on balanced long-term strategic goals. Our Compensation Philosophy, as summarized as a set of objectives below, is designed to encourage prudent risk-taking while attracting the world-class talent necessary to Citi's success.
OUR LEADERSHIP ON PAY EQUITY
We continue to align our compensation programs with stakeholder interests through our pay equity disclosures, related changes to pay, and announced representation goals. In 2017, Citi was the first large U.S. financial institution to publicly release the results of a pay equity review. Our 2017 review compared compensation of women to men in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany, and, in the U.S., minorities to non-minorities. Our review adjusted pay to account for a number of factors to make the comparisons meaningful, including job function, level, and geography, and we modified pay in response to the results. In 2018, we extended our pay equity review to include employees globally, and we found that in 2018 women globally were paid on average 99% of what men are paid at Citi and that there is no statistically significant difference between what U.S. minorities and non-minorities are paid at Citi. As in 2017, we modified pay in 2018 in response to the findings.
Earlier this year, we were the first large U.S. company to disclose our unadjusted or "raw" pay gap for women and U.S. minorities, which measures median total compensation unadjusted for factors such as job function, level, and geography. The analysis shows that the median pay at Citi for women globally is 71% of the median for men, and the median pay at Citi for U.S. minorities is 93% of the median for non-minorities. We are committing to reduce the raw pay gap numbers over time by increasing the representation of women and U.S. minorities in senior and higher-paying roles. As a starting point, our goal is to increase the representation in mid- and senior-level roles to at least 40% for women globally and 8% for Black employees in the U.S. by the end of 2021.
Our Compensation Philosophy is reflected in our executive compensation Framework, which enables incentive compensation awards to closely reflect business and individual performance, consistent with our pay-for-performance approach.

2018 CEO Compensation
As it has done the past several years, the Compensation Committee evaluated 2018 CEO performance using our executive compensation Framework that measures results against quantitative and qualitative goals set at the beginning of the year. As explained in more detail on page 81, we use a rating system of 1 to 5 to assess performance against each goal, with 1 being the highest (Significant Outperform) and 5 being the lowest (Significant Underperform). The green color coding signifies that a quantitative goal set for 2018 was met or exceeded.
Pages 84-85 present a detailed overview of the CEO's scorecard and the performance evaluation process, which resulted in the Compensation Committee awarding Mr. Corbat $24 million in total annual compensation for 2018. His total annual compensation consisted of his base salary of $1.5 million (unchanged since 2013) and a total annual incentive award of $22.5 million, representing a 4% increase over his 2017 total annual compensation of $23 million. Using Citi's balanced scorecard approach to determining pay, the Compensation Committee favorably assessed Mr. Corbat's leadership in multiple critical areas, including enhancing our reputation, delivering value to clients, and continued progress toward Citi's longer-term targets. In addition to Citi's positive operating results, the Compensation Committee also considered market levels of pay for the CEO role at peer institutions.

2018 Pay Elements
Citi's incentive awards delivered to the CEO and the other named executive officers (NEOs) are a mix of cash bonus, Performance Share Units, and Deferred Stock Awards. This incentive structure establishes a balance between annual and long-term compensation, with the majority of incentive compensation delivered in Performance Share Units and Deferred Stock Awards that vest over multiple years. In determining the percentages to award as cash bonuses, Performance Share Units, and Deferred Stock Awards, the Compensation Committee considered applicable regulatory requirements and guidelines for deferral as well as market practices.

Citi's Executive Compensation Framework
Our Compensation Committee uses a five-step process to determine named executive officer incentive compensation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Compensation Committee sets scorecard goals for each named executive officer early in each year. Performance goals fall into two categories, quantitative and qualitative, and vary by named executive officer: 
➢  Quantitative goals include: 
✓  Company-wide goals for all named executive officers that reflect our annual business plan, and 
✓  Business unit-specific goals for named executive officers who are business unit leaders that reflect annual plans for our individual business units. 
➢  Qualitative goals focus on: 
✓  Enhancing Citi's reputation, 
✓  Delivering value to clients, and 
✓  Continued progress toward Citi's longer-term targets. 
● When we set the goals, we also assign weightings to the goals. For 2018 and consistent with prior years, quantitative goals were weighted 70% and qualitative goals were weighted 30% in the calculation of the year-end overall scorecard rating for each named executive officer. 
● After the end of each year, a named executive officer's performance against each quantitative and qualitative goal is assessed. 
● A performance rating is assigned for each goal on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "significant outperform" and 5 being "significant underperform," reflecting a subjective assessment of the executive's performance against the goal. 
● In accordance with the relative weightings established early in 2018, quantitative goal ratings were averaged and weighted 70% and qualitative goals were averaged and weighted 30% in arriving at an overall scorecard rating for each named executive officer. 
● The Compensation Committee rates the CEO's performance, and the Compensation Committee and the CEO rate the performance of the other named executive officers. 
● The Compensation Committee reviews an estimated market pay range for each named executive officer role. Ranges are developed based on public information and third-party market surveys of compensation for the same or comparable roles at peer firms. 
● This practice ensures that our named executive officer pay appropriately reflects market pay, based on varying levels of performance. 
● The Compensation Committee then evaluates each named executive officer's overall scorecard rating relative to the estimated market-based pay range for each named executive officer role. 
● The overall scorecard rating determines whether compensation should be preliminarily targeted at, above, or below the estimated market median pay for the role. An overall scorecard rating of 3 would generally correspond to market median pay levels, with an overall 2 rating generally corresponding to above market median and an overall 4 rating generally corresponding to below market median. 
● The Compensation Committee believes that the simultaneous evaluation of scorecard performance and market pay is the most effective approach to aligning pay and performance in an industry where market levels of pay can change dynamically. 
● Based on the evaluation of the scorecard ratings and market pay described in Step 4, the Compensation Committee, exercising its discretion, determines the final award amount for each named executive officer. The objective, non-formulaic factors (such as risk behaviors) that inform the decision are explained in detail within each named executive officer's scorecard.

Our Compensation Peer Group
The Compensation Committee believes that market compensation levels must frame compensation decisions in order to retain the executive talent necessary to execute the Company's business strategy. Accordingly, a critical step in our executive compensation Framework is the Compensation Committee's understanding of market pay, which it develops through consideration of surveys of historic peer firm compensation for each named executive officer role.
In 2016, the Compensation Committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, established the compensation peer group Citi currently uses to determine market pay ranges. The Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation peer group on an annual basis to ensure that the group continues to be appropriate. The Compensation Committee continues to believe that a U.S.-based peer group reflects the relevant market for executive talent and the relevant regulatory environment for Citi's executive compensation.
Our peers were chosen because they operate in one or more lines of business that are similar to Citi's and compete in similar labor markets, although many do not have global scale that is comparable to Citi.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 COMPENSATION PEER GROUP 
 AIG (AIG) American Express (AXP)  Bank of America (BAC)  BNY Mellon (BK)  Capital One (COF)  Goldman Sachs (GS)  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  MetLife (MET)  Morgan Stanley (MS)  PNC (PNC)  Prudential (PRU)  U.S. Bancorp (USB)  Wells Fargo (WFC) 
[END TABLE]
All compensation peer group firms were included in preparing the market data for the CEO and CFO roles. Not all compensation peer group firms have roles comparable to Citi's named executive officer roles other than the CEO and CFO roles (e.g., the Institutional Clients Group role), so not all of the compensation peer group firms were represented in the market data for each of the other named executive officer roles. In evaluating the market for named executive officer compensation, the Compensation Committee additionally focused on compensation for comparable roles at the U.S.-based global banks with lines of business similar to Citi's. That group includes Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.
In selecting the compensation peer group, the Compensation Committee used size-based metrics as primary screening criteria among financial services firms. Due to the absence of a sufficient number of comparably sized direct peers, the result is a peer group where Citi is above the 75th percentile in size, meaning that the market for target compensation prior to consideration of performance could be the upper quartile. Where Citi pays executives above median, the size and scope of their responsibilities and their performance tend to be critical factors in determining pay ranges.

At December 31, 2018, LatAm GCB had 1,463 retail branches in Mexico, with approximately 29.4 million retail banking customer accounts, $19.7 billion in retail banking loans, and $27.7 billion in deposits. 
● In addition, LatAm GCB had approximately 5.6 million Citi-branded card accounts with $5.7 billion in outstanding loan balances at December 31, 2018. 
● LatAm ICG has a long-standing institutional presence in the region and leverages Citi's global network, digital capabilities, and deep local market expertise. In 2018, LatAm ICG had $4.5 billion in revenue. 
● Company-wide financial results reflected solid progress toward improving Citi's profitability and returns, including return on tangible common equity, in a more challenging revenue environment. Citi attained the targets set at the beginning of 2018 and demonstrated improved operating performance over 2017. The LatAm region performed well, with financial performance above or in line with targets. 
● The Compensation Committee considered Ms. Fraser's notable 2018 qualitative goal achievements, including the success of new client initiatives in the region. 
● Company performance at or above targets and LatAm business performance above targets combined with Ms. Fraser's strong performance against qualitative goals resulted in an overall scorecard rating of 1.72, which points toward compensation above market median for Ms. Fraser's role. The overall scorecard rating was determined by averaging the quantitative goal ratings and weighting the result 70%, averaging the qualitative goal ratings and weighting the result 30%, then adding the two amounts ([1.6 x 0.7] + [2.0 x 0.3] = 1.72). 
● The Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Fraser $9.25 million in 2018 annual compensation, a 9% increase over her 2017 annual compensation of $8.5 million. Ms. Fraser's 2018 compensation was within the range of market median for her role, considering compensation at U.S.-based global banks. In determining the final award amount in the exercise of its discretion, the Compensation Committee relied on the results of the executive compensation Framework, focusing on the overall performance of Citi while recognizing the strong performance of the LatAm region and Ms. Fraser's qualitative results.

Deferred Stock Awards
Thirty-five percent of CEO variable pay and 30% of other named executive officer variable pay are awarded as Deferred Stock Awards, which represent half of Citi's long-term incentive awards for these executives. There have been no changes to the terms of our Deferred Stock Awards since 2013.

 Performance-Based Vesting Condition the amount of the pretax loss the highest level of annual pretax profit for Citigroup in the three years immediately preceding the loss year the amount of the pretax loss the highest level of annual pretax profit for Citigroup in the three years immediately preceding the loss year the amount of the pretax loss the highest level of annual pretax profit for Citigroup in the three years immediately preceding the loss year If that fraction would result in a cancellation of 20% or less of the shares, the shares scheduled to vest will be reduced by 20% (i.e., there is a minimum cancellation level in the event of pretax losses).● This provision cannot result in an increase in award value; the feature can only result in the cancellation of unvested shares.
 Example   This example shows how the portion of a DSA granted in February 2019 of 20,000 shares that is scheduled to vest in January 2020 — 5,000 shares — would be affected, assuming the following pretax profit (loss) history for Citigroup. 
   The profit amounts for 2016, 2017, and 2018 in the example are derived from current publicly reported financial information. The pretax loss amount for 2019 in the example is a hypothetical assumption for illustrative purposes only. The reduction produced by the formula (500 divided by 23,445) is 2.13%. Due to the minimum cancellation level, 20% of shares scheduled to vest in January 2020 would be cancelled. Therefore, 1,000 shares of the 5,000 that were scheduled to vest would be cancelled (1,000 = 20% of 5,000).

Risk and Citi's Incentive Compensation Programs
Our compensation programs are designed in accordance with our responsibility to assume only risks that are prudent and well-understood and to effectively manage those risks to protect the franchise. Our programs have the following important elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our Compensation Philosophy requires us to consider risk management when making discretionary incentive compensation awards. Our Compensation Philosophy is available on our public website. 
[END TABLE]
(continued on next page)
www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Chief Risk Officer reports at least twice annually to the Compensation Committee on risk levels and trends across Citi, as well as incentive compensation frameworks at the senior executive level and throughout Citi. The Chief Risk Officer has reviewed our executive compensation Framework to help ensure that compensation is aligned with long-term performance in a manner that does not encourage imprudent or excessive risk-taking. 
● Citi's executive compensation Framework explicitly and implicitly adjusts incentive awards for risk. Citi's executive compensation Framework takes risk into account in a number of ways, including: 
➢  Using financial metrics intended to assess risk levels as an element of each executive's quantitative goals; 
➢  Evaluating risk management performance, including effectiveness of the control environment, as part of the qualitative goals; and 
➢  Taking adverse risk outcomes into account when determining incentive compensation. 
● An assessment of risk management behaviors is taken into account in determining individual incentive awards. For individual covered employees (several hundred of the most senior employees at Citi), Citi has established an annual control function review process in which reviewers from the control functions provide an evaluation of each covered employee's risk behaviors. The control functions are Finance, Independent Compliance Risk Management, Internal Audit, Legal, and Risk Management. The process is designed to evaluate current behavior and attitudes toward risk. The rating from the control function review process informs and influences the covered employee's performance review conducted by the employee's manager, and the results of the process are reported to the Compensation Committee. We believe this process has improved awareness of the importance of risk management behaviors and has resulted in the strengthening of Citi's risk culture. The named executive officers other than Mr. Corbat were evaluated on risk behaviors by Citi's control functions through this annual control function review process, and Mr. Corbat was assessed on risk behaviors by the Compensation Committee with input from the control functions. These reviews resulted in positive ratings or assessments on risk behaviors for the named executive officers. The positive ratings were not determinative of the size of the annual incentive awards for 2018, as a positive rating on risk behaviors is an expected element of job performance in all covered employee roles. A negative risk rating on risk behaviors would have resulted in the reduction or elimination of incentive compensation awarded for 2018. 
● Annual incentive awards to covered employees, including the named executive officers, have design features intended to discourage imprudent or excessive risk-taking. Through a systematic annual process, Citi identifies the inherent material risks to the firm and then identifies employees with influence over those risks as covered employees. The compensation structure for covered employees, including the named executive officers, includes substantial deferrals and clawbacks intended to cover a range of behaviors. Furthermore, performance-based vesting criteria are a part of all deferred incentive compensation awarded to covered employees. 
● Citi has a strong global governance process covering Citi's incentive compensation plans. Citi's formulaic incentive compensation plans, including its sales incentive plans, provide variable compensation to a broad-based population of employees predominantly in Global Consumer Banking. The plans are administered through a global governance process that is designed to eliminate incentives to engage in illegal or imprudent conduct or take imprudent or excessive risks. As part of this governance process, all of Citi's incentive compensation plans throughout the world are analyzed through a central risk management model developed and administered by a third-party consultant with input from Citi. Six potential sources of risk are assessed: incentive program design, misalignment with Citi's strategy and goals, pay opportunity offered by the plan, payout approval process, extent of monitoring as part of plan governance, and risks associated with plan administration. Plans are remediated based on the results of the risk assessment, if appropriate. This global governance model ensures that best practices are communicated and shared throughout Citi.

● Clawbacks applicable to Performance Share Units and Deferred Stock Awards. Citi's robust clawback policies are applicable to incentive awards to the named executive officers and all other eligible employees. The clawback provisions provide Citi with the right to cancel unvested deferred incentive compensation under a range of adverse outcomes and are summarized in the table below: 
[END TABLE]
At a minimum, Citi will consider whether a Material Adverse Outcome has occurred and potential impact on Performance Share Units if there is an annual pretax loss at any of the following three reportable financial segments: Citigroup (the entire company), Global Consumer Banking, and Institutional Clients Group. Citi will also consider making public disclosures whenever a decision has been made to cancel deferred compensation payable to an executive officer because he or she had significant responsibility for a Material Adverse Outcome or otherwise.
Our Independent Compensation Consultant
FW Cook has been the Compensation Committee's independent advisor since 2012. FW Cook provides no services to Citi other than its services to the Board, has no other ties to management that could jeopardize its fully independent status, and has strong internal governance policies that help ensure that it maintains its independence. Representatives of FW Cook attended all Compensation Committee meetings during 2018, including executive sessions as requested, and engaged with Compensation Committee members between meetings. FW Cook advised the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation awarded to the CEO and other executive officers. FW Cook also provided extensive guidance and analysis regarding the Compensation Committee's and the Board's responses to Citi's advisory say-on-pay votes, offered market insights, and provided advice to the Compensation Committee on Citi's executive compensation plan design and the presentation of its programs to stockholders. FW Cook also provided advice to the Board on non-executive director compensation. In 2018, FW Cook was paid fees of $282,428 for advice regarding executive compensation. Pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook most recently in January 2019 and determined that FW Cook is independent from Citi management and that its work for the Compensation Committee has not raised any conflicts of interest.

Tax Deductibility of and Limits on Incentive Compensation
Annual incentive awards for 2018 were awarded to named executive officers under the 2011 Executive Performance Plan (the EPP). The EPP was originally adopted to preserve the deductibility of incentive compensation paid to the named executive officers that might otherwise not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, Tax Reform amended Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code by removing the exception for qualified performance-based compensation and expanding it to cover the CFO, thereby reducing the potential for deductible executive compensation for 2018 and later years. While Citi has sought to preserve deductibility of compensation paid to the named executive officers to the extent permitted by law, Citi has retained the flexibility to provide nondeductible compensation arrangements it believes are necessary to recruit, incentivize, and retain its executives.
Citi does not intend to change its pay-for-performance approach to awarding executive pay even though Tax Reform eliminated the tax benefits of awarding qualified performance-based compensation. Accordingly, the Committee awarded named executive officer incentive compensation for 2018 performance under the EPP and subject to its limits on executive compensation. The EPP specifies a maximum amount that can be awarded to a participant for any year based on Citigroup's income from continuing operations before income taxes. The amount of annual incentive actually awarded for the year, however, is determined by the Compensation Committee, applying the executive compensation Framework described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and subject to the condition that Citi may pay less (but not more) than the maximum. For 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the maximum amount payable under the EPP as $46.8 million per executive (0.2% of Citigroup pretax earnings) and exercised its negative discretion to award lesser amounts under the plan. In addition to this limit on total incentive pay, the EPP limits the annual cash bonus portion of individual executive officer incentive pay to $20 million.
The Personnel and Compensation Committee Report
The Personnel and Compensation Committee has evaluated the performance of and determined the compensation for the CEO, approved the compensation of executive officers, and approved the compensation structure for other members of senior management and other highly compensated employees. The Personnel and Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with members of senior management and, based on this review, the Personnel and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of Citigroup Inc. that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in Citi's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC.

2018 Pension Benefits
Citi's policy is that executives should accrue retirement benefits on the same basis generally available to Citi employees under Citi's broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plans. Citi has not granted extra years of credited service under any retirement plan to any of the named executive officers. Mr. Bird and Ms. Fraser have never been eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan under the terms of Citi's broad-based retirement programs in effect in their employment countries; they have participated only in defined contribution retirement plans since the commencement of their employment at Citi.
The following describes the pension plans listed in the 2018 Pension Benefits Table.
The Citigroup Pension Plan. The purpose of this broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plan is to provide retirement income on a tax-deferred basis to all eligible U.S. employees. Effective December 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was closed to new members and generally ceased benefit accruals effective December 31, 2007. Mr. Corbat, Mr. Gerspach, and Mr. Forese are eligible for benefits under this plan. Mr. Corbat's and Mr. Forese's entire benefits are cash balance benefits, and Mr. Gerspach accrued a cash balance benefit from 2000 through 2007.
The Citigroup Pension Plan cash balance benefit is expressed as a hypothetical account balance. Prior to January 1, 2008, the plan generally provided for the annual accrual of benefit credits for most of the covered population, including the covered named executive officers, at a rate between 1.5% and 6% of eligible compensation; the benefit credit rate increased with age and service. Eligible compensation generally included base salary and incentive awards, but excluded compensation payable after termination of employment, certain non-recurring payments, and other benefits. Annual eligible compensation was limited by the Internal Revenue Code to $225,000 for 2007 (the final year of cash balance benefit accrual). Interest credits continue to be applied annually to each participant's account balance; these credits are based on the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue Service).
Prior to 2000, Mr. Gerspach accrued a benefit under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula, which is a component of The Citigroup Pension Plan. That formula generally provided for an annual benefit of 2% of annual average compensation per year of service for up to 30 years of credited service plus 0.75% of average annual compensation for up to an additional five years of credited service, reduced by an offset based on an estimated Social Security benefit. Annual compensation included base salary and excluded bonus and incentive pay, and average annual compensation was the average of the five highest years of annual compensation out of the final 10 annual computation periods. Annual compensation was also subject to limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Benefits under The Citigroup Pension Plan are payable in annuity form or in other optional forms, including a lump sum, upon termination of employment. The Citigroup Pension Plan's normal retirement age is 65. The portion of an eligible participant's benefit determined under the Citibank Retirement Plan formula may be paid upon early retirement, which is defined for this purpose as the first day of the month after the later of the participant's 55th birthday or the date on which the participant completes a year of service (as defined in the plan). Mr. Gerspach has attained eligibility for early retirement, and there would be no reduction in his benefits attributable to early retirement under the terms of the plan because he attained age 60 while employed.
Supplemental ERISA Compensation Plan of Citibank, N.A. and Affiliates (Pay Cap Plan). The Pay Cap Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The Pay Cap Plan provided benefits not otherwise provided under The Citigroup Pension Plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on eligible pay and benefits. To the extent that a participant's benefit was determined under the cash balance formula in The Citigroup Pension Plan, eligible compensation under the Pay Cap Plan was limited to $500,000 beginning January 1, 2000. Future benefit accruals under the Pay Cap Plan ceased effective January 1, 2002, for most participants in the plan, including Mr. Gerspach. Benefits under the Pay Cap Plan are payable at the same time as benefits are payable under The Citigroup Pension Plan; accordingly, Mr. Gerspach is eligible for early retirement and immediate commencement under the Pay Cap Plan.
2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The following is additional information on the plan shown in the 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.
Citicorp Deferred Compensation Plan. Mr. Gerspach participates in the Citicorp Deferred Compensation Plan, which was closed in 2001 and provided for mandatory and voluntary deferrals of compensation from 1996 through 2000 for employees of Citicorp. All mandatory deferrals under the Citicorp Deferred Compensation Plan have been distributed to participants, but voluntary deferrals are notionally invested at the participant's election in one of six pre-determined investment alternatives. Participants may change investment elections up to four times per year. All amounts deferred under the Citicorp Deferred Compensation Plan are fully vested and are distributed in a lump sum or installments at the participant's election upon termination at or after the attainment of age 55.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control
Mr. Gerspach's Retirement. Mr. Gerspach retired as Citi CFO effective February 22, 2019, immediately following the filing of Citi's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. He retired from Citi employment effective March 1, 2019. Mr. Gerspach did not receive any special compensation as a result of his retirement.

General Policies. Citi does not provide guaranteed executive severance or change of control agreements, and none of the named executive officers has an individually negotiated employment or separation agreement.
Potential Payments Table. Set forth below is a table showing the estimated value of outstanding awards that would have been delivered over time to each named executive officer, had the applicable employment termination or other event occurred on December 31, 2018 and assuming that all award vesting and performance conditions are satisfied. Unless the awards are forfeited, the awards shown in the Potential Payments Table vest on schedule following termination of employment and do not accelerate by their terms except in the case of death. The closing price of Citi's common stock on December 31, 2018 ($52.06) was used in developing the estimates shown in the Potential Payments Table.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Potential Payments Table includes (a) the value of the Performance Share Units granted in February 2016 assuming that relative total shareholder return and the Citi common stock price at December 31, 2018, remained unchanged through the final vesting date; and (b) the value of the Performance Share Units granted in February 2017 and February 2018 assuming that Performance Share Units are earned at 100% of target levels and that the Citi common stock price at December 31, 2018, remains unchanged through the final vesting date. 
(2)  Ms. Fraser's Deferred Cash Awards are denominated in British pounds as they were awarded for years in which she was employed in London. The amounts presented above for Ms. Fraser are shown as converted from British pounds to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2018, conversion rate used to prepare Citi's financial statements (1.2736 U.S. dollars = 1 British pound). 
[END TABLE]
Deferred Stock Awards; Rule of 60. Deferred Stock Awards granted to the named executive officers under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan vest over a period of four years subject to performance conditions. Deferred Stock Awards provide for accelerated vesting if a participant dies but provide for vesting on schedule in all other circumstances in which vesting occurs after termination of employment. If a participant's combined years of age and service meet the Rule of 60 at the time he or she voluntarily resigns, the participant's Deferred Stock Awards will continue to vest on schedule over the four-year period, provided he or she does not work for a "significant competitor" during the vesting period. A participant meets the Rule of 60 if his or her age plus full years of service equals at least 60 and he or she either: (i) is at least age 50 with at least five full years of service; or (ii) is under age 50 with at least 20 full years of service. Partial years of age and service are each rounded down to the nearest whole number. In contrast, if a participant does not meet the Rule of 60 and voluntarily resigns, any unvested Deferred Stock Awards shares are forfeited, unless the participant becomes employed in an "alternative career."
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Under the "alternative career" provisions of Citi's Deferred Stock Awards, employees may continue to vest in their deferred awards if they resign from Citi to work full-time in government or at a charitable organization or to teach full-time at an educational institution. All of the named executive officers attained the Rule of 60 prior to 2018, so none of them are eligible for the "alternative career" provisions, and each of them would be eligible for continued vesting following resignation without regard to whether they pursued an "alternative career."
Performance Share Units. Performance Share Units have the same vesting provisions covering termination of employment as those applicable to Citi's Deferred Stock Awards, including the Rule of 60. Any named executive officer who meets the Rule of 60 will receive his or her earned Performance Share Units unless: (i) he or she voluntarily resigns during the performance period and performs services for a competitor, or (ii) he or she is terminated for gross misconduct (in which case the undelivered award is cancelled). If a named executive officer who meets the Rule of 60 resigns and competes, at the end of the performance period, he or she will forfeit a prorated Performance Share Unit award, based on his or her service during the performance period. For example, if such a named executive officer resigns after the first year of the performance period to work for a competitor, he or she will receive one-third of the earned Performance Share Units after the end of the three-year performance period and the other two-thirds will be forfeited.
Deferred Cash Awards. Deferred Cash Awards were granted to senior executives before the creation of our Performance Share Unit program and are also granted to executives who are not eligible for Performance Share Units, which are awarded only to the CEO and executives who report directly to him. Like our Performance Share Units, Deferred Cash Awards represent 50% of each executive's deferred incentive award for the applicable performance year with Deferred Stock Awards representing the other 50%. Deferred Cash Awards are a fixed amount that earns notional interest at a fixed market rate and vests over a period of four years. The treatment of Deferred Cash Awards upon termination of employment is the same as the treatment of Deferred Stock Awards.
"Double Trigger" Change of Control Requirement. Citi's 2014 Stock Incentive Plan has a "double trigger" requirement, which provides that an involuntary termination of employment not for gross misconduct must occur as a result of a "change of control" of Citi before any vesting of equity awards may occur in connection with the change of control. The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, which is subject to stockholder approval at the 2019 Annual Meeting pursuant to Proposal 4 of this Proxy Statement, has the same provision. In addition, the Compensation Committee has a policy that equity awards granted to executive officers will not be accelerated solely by reason of a change of control of Citigroup Inc. The intent of the policy is for such a change of control to have no impact on the applicable awards. The same change of control provisions apply to Citi's Performance Share Units and Deferred Cash Awards.
Under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, a "change of control" means: (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii) specified changes in the majority of the Board (not including the election of Directors whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that results in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation resulting from the transaction. The 2019 Stock Incentive Plan has the same provision.
Management Analysis of Potential Adverse Effects of Compensation Plans
Citi has adopted multiple coordinated strategies to manage the risk of material adverse effects to the franchise through the design and administration of its incentive compensation programs, including those applicable to the named executive officers. During 2018, Citi continued its efforts to align its processes with the U.S. Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies and the Financial Stability Board's Principles for Sound Compensation Practices. Citi's approach to risk and incentive compensation plans is detailed on pages 95-97 of this Proxy Statement. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, management has concluded that Citi's compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Citi.

Proposal 4: Approval of the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan
On the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board has unanimously approved the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan), which will become effective on April 16, 2019, if approved by stockholders at our Annual Meeting. Upon approval, the 2019 Plan will become the only equity compensation plan under which we will grant shares. Currently, we grant equity awards exclusively under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan), and the 2014 Plan will expire by its terms on April 16, 2019. The 2019 Plan is proposed to replace the 2014 Plan. The discussion and description of the 2019 Plan that follows is qualified in its entirety by the text of the 2019 Plan that is included as Annex B.

Citi's equity awards are a key component of annual incentive awards for thousands of employees worldwide, thereby aligning the interests of stockholders and a broader group of Citi employees (not just senior executives). In 2018, approximately 7,350 employees in 63 countries received equity awards under the 2014 Plan as part of their annual incentive awards.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
All of Citi's outstanding equity awards have been granted under two stockholder-approved plans—the 2014 Plan and its predecessor, the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). There are no equity awards outstanding under plans for which stockholder approval was not required or sought. The information below is as of December 31, 2018.

New Plan Benefits
Awards under the 2019 Plan will be granted by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. Therefore, the benefits or amounts that will be received by any particular employee or group of employees in the future is not determinable at this time.
Description of the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan
This summary description of the 2019 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the 2019 Plan document, which is included as Annex B to this Proxy Statement. If Proposal 4 is approved by stockholders at our Annual Meeting, we intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to register the shares authorized for grant under the 2019 Plan.
General. If Proposal 4 is approved by stockholders, the 2019 Plan will become effective on April 16, 2019 and will expire on the date of the annual general meeting of stockholders to be held in 2024. The 2019 Plan provides for various types of awards denominated in shares of Citi common stock to Citi employees, officers, and non-employee Directors. The NYSE closing price of a share of Citi common stock on February 26, 2019 was $64.12.
Administration. The 2019 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. All members of such Committee or a sub-committee thereof must satisfy the requirements for independence of SEC Rule 16b-3. With respect to participants who are outside Directors, the 2019 Plan is administered by the Board. The Compensation Committee may delegate some or all of its authority over administration of the 2019 Plan to one or more officers, directors, employees, or another plan administrator except with respect to persons who are Section 16(a) officers. In addition, any special terms or conditions that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in non-U.S. law, tax policy or custom may be included a sub-plan that forms a part of the 2019 Plan.
Eligibility. All "employees" of Citi—within the broad definition set forth in the instructions to the SEC Form S-8 registration statement, as in effect on April 16, 2019, but expressly excluding consultants and advisors who are not members of the Board—generally are eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. Based on worldwide employment at December 31, 2018, approximately 204,000 persons could be eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan. However, participation is discretionary—awards are subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. In general, employees with discretionary annual incentive awards of at least $100,000 are eligible to receive at least 25% of that annual award in deferred stock. In 2019 through February 26, 2019, awards were made under the 2014 Plan to 16 non-employee Directors, 17 executive officers, and approximately 7,350 employees worldwide. Former "employees" are eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, but only with respect to their last year of service or substitute awards to replace awards granted by a prior employer acquired by the Company.
Shares subject to the 2019 Plan. Shares of Citi common stock issued in connection with awards under the 2019 Plan may be shares that are authorized but unissued, or previously issued shares that have been reacquired, or both. The initial share authorization under the 2019 Plan is 30 million shares. (The shares authorized under the 2019 Plan is estimated to be approximately equal to number of shares that would no longer be available for grant upon expiration of the 2014 Plan.)
"Recycling" provisions. If an award under the 2019 Plan, or, after April 16, 2019, the 2014 Plan and the 2009 Plan, is forfeited, cancelled, or expires or is settled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to such award will be available for future grants under the 2019 Plan. However, shares tendered by a participant or withheld by Citi to pay an option exercise price, withheld or tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any award, repurchased by Citi with option exercise proceeds, covered by a stock-settled SAR (without regard to the number of shares actually issued upon exercise) or withheld to satisfy any debt or other obligation owed to Citi, and cancelled fractional shares will be considered issued and shall not be added to the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2019 Plan.
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Limits on awards. The maximum number of shares subject to awards to an individual Director in a calendar year (including awards made at the election of a Director in lieu of his or her cash retainer), taken together with any cash fees paid during the calendar year to the Director, in respect of the Director's service as a member of the Board during such year (including service as a member or chair of any committees of the Board), may not exceed $1,000,000 in value, as determined as of the date of each award. However, the independent members of the Board may make exceptions to this limit for a non-executive chair of the Board, provided that the Director receiving any additional compensation may not participate in the decision to award such compensation. For all other eligible "employees," the number of shares subject to stock options or SARs granted during a calendar year may not exceed one million shares, and the number of shares that may be subject to stock awards granted in a calendar year may not exceed one million shares, unless granted subject to substitute awards that replace awards of a former employer acquired by the Company.
Types of awards. The following types of awards may be made under the 2019 Plan:
www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents
Minimum vesting requirement. Awards granted under the 2019 Plan may not vest earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the award is granted, except that the Compensation Committee may grant awards that vest in less than a year (i) as a "substitute award" to replace awards of a former employer acquired by the Company, (ii) awards to Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, and (iii) any additional awards the Compensation Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan. This restriction does not apply to the Compensation Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any award, including in cases of retirement, death, disability, leave of absence, termination of employment, change of control, or upon the sale or other disposition of the subsidiary employing a participant or other similar event.
Performance conditions. In the case of an award subject to a performance condition, the applicable performance condition may include one or more of the following performance conditions and be expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or relative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product growth, net income (pre-or after-tax), earnings, earnings per share, stockholders' equity or return on stockholders' equity, assets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets, capital or return on capital, return on risk capital, book value or book value per share, economic value-added models or equivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income, expenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash flow per share, stock price, total shareholder return, market share, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency ratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory achievements, or any objective or subjective performance conditions selected by the Compensation Committee.
Prohibition against repricing. The 2019 Plan prohibits any action under the 2019 Plan that would constitute a "repricing" of any outstanding option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, the 2014 Plan, the 2009 Plan or any other plan of the Company or of any acquired company, except with the approval of the stockholders of the Company. The 2019 Plan defines "repricing" to mean (i) any action that constitutes a "repricing" under GAAP or the rules of the NYSE (including any modification or amendment to an outstanding option or SAR that has the effect of reducing its exercise price); (ii) any cancellation of an outstanding option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds its fair market value in exchange for cash; (iii) any cancellation of an option or SAR in exchange for a new option or SAR with a lower exercise price; or (iv) a substitution of a stock award for an option or SAR when its exercise price exceeds fair market value; in each case other than a permitted equitable adjustment.
Prohibition of reload options. The 2019 Plan does not permit the grant of "reload" options.
Repayment obligation; right of set-off. If the Compensation Committee subsequently determines that all conditions to vesting and payment of an award, or the vesting and exercisability of an option or SAR, were not satisfied in full, the Compensation Committee may cancel such vesting or exercise and refuse to issue shares and immediately terminate the participant's rights with respect to such award (or improperly vested portion thereof). If the vesting or exercise of any such award (or portion thereof) has already been settled by delivery of shares or cash, the participant shall be obligated, upon demand, to return the shares or cash (or higher value received at vesting or exercise), to Citi, without reduction for any shares or cash withheld to satisfy withholding tax or other obligations. Consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the 2019 Plan also provides for the set-off of vested awards against obligations a participant may owe to Citi, including but not limited to the obligation to repay improperly vested or exercised awards. Any failure to timely pay tax-related obligations owing to Citi in connection with an award may result in its cancellation.
Non-transferability. During the vesting period, awards and sale-restricted shares generally are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Adjustments. The 2019 Plan provides that the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the maximum number of shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan and to the annual individual award limits expressed in numbers of shares in the event of any changes to the Company's capital structure,
Citi 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents including a change in the number of shares outstanding on account of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spinoff or any similar equity restructuring, or any combination or exchange of equity securities, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar transaction. In the event of any such transaction, or any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of shares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise prices of outstanding options and SARs, and performance conditions, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement or diminution of participants' rights.
Change of control. The Compensation Committee may, when an award is made, or at any time prior to, at, or after the time of a "change of control" (as defined below), provide for the adjustment of performance conditions to reflect the change of control, provide for the cancellation of outstanding awards if the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or acquiring entity's parent company) replaces the awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value, provide for the acceleration of any time periods or the waiver of any other conditions to vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an award upon an involuntary termination of a participant's employment as a result of a change of control, or provide for the purchase of any award. The vesting, payment, purchase, or distribution of an award, however, may not be accelerated by reason of a change of control for any participant unless the participant's employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of the change of control. For these purposes, a termination of employment as a result of a change of control means involuntary termination of employment other than for "gross misconduct" (as defined in the 2019 Plan) upon, or on or prior to the first anniversary of, the change of control.
The 2019 Plan defines a "change of control" to mean (i) a person acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership of Citigroup Inc. securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of then outstanding securities of Citigroup Inc.; (ii) specified changes in the majority of the Board (not including the election of Directors whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the then incumbent Board); (iii) a sale, transfer, or distribution of all or substantially all of the assets of Citigroup Inc. or a dissolution or liquidation of Citigroup Inc.; or (iv) consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or other corporate transaction that results in stockholders of Citigroup Inc. not owning more than 50% of the combined voting power of Citigroup Inc. or other corporation resulting from the transaction.
Tax withholding. Citi retains the right to deduct or withhold, or require the participant to remit to his or her employer, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local, and foreign taxes (including hypothetical taxes owed to Citi by tax-equalized expatriates) required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event as a result of the 2019 Plan.
Amendment and termination. The 2019 Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated by the Compensation Committee at any time, provided that no amendment shall be made without stockholder approval if it would materially increase the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan (other than in connection with an equitable adjustment), materially expand the types of awards available under the 2019 Plan or the class of persons eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan, materially extend the term of the 2019 Plan, materially change the method of determining the exercise price of an option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan, delete or limit the prohibition against "repricing," or otherwise require approval by stockholders in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of the NYSE (or principal national securities exchange upon which Citi's common stock is traded or quoted).
Award modification. The Compensation Committee retains the right to modify outstanding awards without a participant's prior consent if it determines that the modification is required to comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax law). Subject to certain exceptions, any other modifications, if adverse to a participant, shall not be effective without the participant's written consent.

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a brief summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to stock options granted under the 2019 Plan, based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary does not constitute tax advice and, among other things, does not describe state, local, or foreign tax consequences, which may be substantially different.
Generally, a participant will not recognize taxable income on the grant of a stock option. Upon the exercise of a stock option, a participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Citi common stock received on the date of exercise and the option cost (number of shares purchased multiplied by the exercise price per share). The participant will recognize ordinary income upon the exercise of the option even though the shares acquired may be subject to further restrictions on sale or transferability. Citi will ordinarily be entitled to a deduction on the exercise date in an amount equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant upon exercise, except as may be specified under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally, upon a subsequent sale of shares acquired in an option exercise, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost basis of the shares sold will be taxable as a capital gain or loss, including any sale of shares freed from sale restrictions to fund the payment of taxes incurred at exercise. The 2019 Plan does not provide for awards of "incentive stock options," which have different tax consequences under the Internal Revenue Code.

Stockholder Proposals
Citi makes every effort to be responsive to concerns expressed by our stockholders by engaging in dialogues, participating in issuer/investor working groups, and adopting policies or initiatives we believe to be in the best interests of all stockholders. Over the years, Citi has met with several proponents and other interested parties regarding such issues as gender pay equity, proxy access, human rights, the Company's response to regulation (Dodd-Frank, credit cards), derivatives, risk management, auditor rotation, and trade association payments, among others, and has, on certain occasions, as appropriate, taken action in response to these engagements and/ or shareholder votes. We encourage our stockholders to communicate with management and the Board. Any stockholder wishing to communicate with management, the Board, or an individual Director, or obtain the addresses of any of the stockholder proponents or their Citi stock ownership information, should send a request to the Corporate Secretary, Rohan Weerasinghe, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013.
Proposal 5
John Chevedden has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
Proposal 5 – Shareholder Proxy Access Enhancement
RESOLVED: Stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated documents, to include the following change for the purpose of decreasing the average amount of Company common stock the average member of a nominating group would be required to hold for 3-years to satisfy the aggregate ownership requirements to form a nominating group and to increase the possible number of proxy access director candidates:
No limitation shall be placed on the number of stockholders that can aggregate their shares to achieve the 3% of common stock required to nominate directors under our Company's proxy access provisions.
Proxy access for shareholders enables shareholders to put competing director candidates on the company ballot to see if they can get more votes than some of management's director candidates. A competitive election is good for everyone. This proposal can help ensure that our management will nominate directors with outstanding qualifications in order to avoid giving shareholders a reason to exercise their right to use proxy access.
Even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the current 3% criteria for a continuous 3-years at most companies according to the Council of Institutional Investors. This proposal addresses the situation that our company now has with proxy access potentially for only the largest shareholders who are the least unlikely shareholders to make use of it.
Since no group of shareholders at any U.S. company has yet to make use of proxy access, it is important to make sure that the current limitation of 20 shareholders is not a deterrent to shareholders using proxy access.
A more practical proxy access right would put shareholders in a better position to ask for improvement in our stock price performance of a decline from $71 to $63 in the year leading up to the submittal of this proposal.

Management Comment
Summary
Citi implemented a progressive proxy access by-law provision for our stockholders in 2015 that is aligned with current best practices, providing stockholders with meaningful and appropriate proxy access rights while taking into account the need to balance enhancing stockholder rights with protecting the interests of all our stockholders. The Board adopted the proxy access by-law provision after careful consideration and engagement with a number of our stockholders. Since our adoption of proxy access, we have had further discussions regarding proxy access with stockholders. Based on their feedback as well as a benchmarking review of proxy access rights adopted by other companies, we continue to believe that our current proxy access structure is the most appropriate for the Company and its stockholders at this time.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Recommendation Because Citi has adopted progressive proxy access by-law provisions that serve the best interests of the Company and our stockholders and is in line with best practices among Citi's peers and the vast majority of large cap companies, adoption of the stockholder proposal is not necessary or appropriate; therefore the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 5.

Proposal 6
AFL–CIO Reserve Fund has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED: Shareholders of Citigroup Inc. (the "Company") request that the Board of Directors adopt a policy prohibiting the vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives due to a voluntary resignation to enter government service (a "Government Service Golden Parachute").
For purposes of this resolution, "equity-based awards" include stock options, restricted stock and other stock awards granted under an equity incentive plan. "Government service" includes employment with any U.S. federal, state or local government, any supranational or international organization, any self-regulatory organization, or any agency or instrumentality of any such government or organization, or any electoral campaign for public office.
This policy shall be implemented so as not to violate existing contractual obligations or the terms of any compensation or benefit plan currently in existence or approved by shareholders on the date this proposal is adopted, and it shall apply only to equity plans or plan amendments that shareholders approve after the date of the 2019 annual meeting.
Supporting Statement:
Our Company provides its senior executives with vesting of equity-based awards after their voluntary resignation of employment from the Company to pursue a career in government service. In other words, our Company gives a "golden parachute" for entering government service. Although the Company's current named executive officers may have attained the "rule of 60" under which deferred stock awards continue to vest on schedule, future named executive officers and other senior executives may be able to take advantage of this golden parachute.
At most companies, equity-based awards vest over a period of time to compensate executives for their labor during the commensurate period. If an executive voluntarily resigns before the vesting criteria are satisfied, unvested awards are usually forfeited. While government service is commendable, we question the practice of our Company providing continued vesting of equity-based awards to executives who voluntarily resign to enter government service.
The vesting of equity-based awards over a period of time is a powerful tool for companies to attract and retain talented employees. But contrary to this goal, our Company's award agreements contain a "Voluntary Resignation to Pursue Alternative Career" clause that provides for the continued vesting of restricted stock of executives who voluntarily resign to pursue a government service career.
In last year's proxy statement, the Company responded to this proposal by stating its desire to facilitate "some degree of parity between private and public sector employment" because "unvested awards are typically replaced with new awards by a new private sector employer." In our view, it is simply not appropriate for our Company's employees who choose to enter government service to be "bought out" in this way.
We believe that compensation plans should align the interests of senior executives with the long-term interests of the Company. We oppose compensation plans that provide windfalls to executives that are unrelated to their performance. For these reasons, we question how our Company benefits from providing Government Service Golden Parachutes. Surely our Company does not expect to receive favorable treatment from its former executives?

Summary
Citi's deferred compensation programs, like those of many other companies, include provisions that alter an award's regular forfeiture conditions and provide for vesting in a range of circumstances (e.g., termination of employment on account of death, disability, involuntary termination not for cause, and upon meeting certain retirement-type age and service provisions). The alternative career provision, which is available to all employees who are eligible for deferred compensation awards (not just senior executives), is one of these exceptions. Under the alternative career provision, an employee who is not eligible for retirement may resign to work full-time in a paid career in government service, for a charitable institution, or as a teacher at an educational institution, and have his/her awards continue to vest on schedule. (A retirement-eligible employee may work for such employers and continue to vest regardless of the alternative career provision.) We believe that the alternative career provision, like other exceptions to the vesting conditions of our programs, helps us attract talented employees, which is a goal that furthers both our long-term business objectives and benefits stockholders at minimal cost.
Important Points to Consider
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Recommendation The alternative career provision advances stockholder interests by enabling Citi to attract and retain talented employees; adopting this Proposal would put Citi at a competitive disadvantage and could harm the Company and its employees; therefore the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this Proposal 6.

Proposal 7
Kenneth Steiner has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
Proposal 7 – Special Shareholder Meetings
Resolved, Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders in the aggregate of 15% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting.
Special shareholder meetings allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison. This proposal topic, sponsored by William Steiner, also won 78% support at a Sprint annual meeting with 1.7 Billion yes-votes. Nuance Communications (NUAN) shareholders gave 94%-support in February 2018 to a rule 14a-8 proposal calling for 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting.
This proposal topic won majority support at the 2011 Citigroup annual meeting and also 49.9% support at the 2018 Citigroup annual meeting. Both these votes would have been higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.
Our current higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting may be unreachable due to time constraints and the detailed technical requirements that can easily trigger disqualifying errors by shareholders.
Any claim that a shareholder right to call a special meeting can be costly – may be moot. When shareholders have a good reason to call a special meeting – our board should be able to take positive responding action to make a special meeting unnecessary.
Shareholder proposals such as this have taken a leadership role to improve the corporate governance rules of our company. For instance Citigroup adopted shareholder proxy access after James McRitchie submitted a proxy access proposal in 2014 and 2015.
Please vote yes:
Special Shareholder Meetings – Proposal 7
Management Comment
Summary
Citi supports stockholders having the right to call a special meeting, which is why Citi's By-laws already provided stockholders that own at least 25% of the outstanding shares of the company's common stock the power to call a special meeting of stockholders. In response to the vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting on a proposal to lower the threshold to 15%, which did not pass but received significant shareholder support, the Board, taking into account the vote result, input from institutional investors and peer thresholds, has carefully considered the appropriate ownership threshold to call a special meeting and amended Citi's By-laws to lower the threshold to 20%. The 20% threshold aligns Citi with many of its peers and strikes an appropriate balance between the right of shareholders to call a special meeting and the interests of Citi and our stockholders in promoting the appropriate use of Company resources. Given the number of outlets stockholders have to express their concerns, Citi believes that the adjustment to the 20% threshold properly addresses shareholder concerns, without providing undue power to a small minority of stockholders.

Submission of Future Stockholder Proposals
Under SEC Rule 14a-8, a stockholder who intends to present a proposal at the next Annual Meeting of stockholders and who wishes the proposal to be included in the Proxy Statement for that meeting must submit the proposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of Citi, Rohan Weerasinghe, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. The proposal must be received no later than November 7, 2019. The proposal and its proponent must satisfy all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8.
Citi's By-laws permit a stockholder or group of stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least 3% of Citi common stock for at least three years to submit Director nominees (up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the Board, as determined in accordance with the By-laws) for inclusion in Citi's Proxy Statement if the nominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements specified in the By-laws. With respect to stockholder nominees for Director election submitted for inclusion in Citi's Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting, written notice of nominations must be provided by the stockholder proponent(s) to Citi in accordance with Citi's By-laws. The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi's Corporate Secretary between October 8, 2019 and November 7, 2019. These deadlines are based on the 150th day and 120th day, respectively, before the one-year anniversary of the date that the Proxy Statement for this Annual Meeting was first sent to stockholders (which date, for purposes of Citi's By-laws, is March 6, 2019). The ability to include a nominee in Citi's Proxy Statement is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Citi's By-laws.
With respect to stockholder nominees for Director election at the next Annual Meeting (other than nominees submitted for inclusion in Citi's proxy materials) and stockholder proposals for consideration at the next Annual Meeting that are not submitted for inclusion in Citi's proxy materials under Rule 14a-8, written notice of nominations and proposals must be provided by the stockholder proponent to Citi in accordance with Citi's By-laws. The notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, Citi's Corporate Secretary, Rohan Weerasinghe, between December 18, 2019 and January 17, 2020 and must comply with all applicable provisions of Citi's By-laws. You may obtain a copy of Citi's By-laws on Citi's website or by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Rohan Weerasinghe, at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013.
Cost of Annual Meeting and Proxy Solicitation
Citi pays the cost of the Annual Meeting and the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Citi may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, and similar means. No Director, officer, or employee of Citi will be specially compensated for these activities. Citi also intends to request that brokers, banks, and other nominees solicit proxies from their principals and will pay the brokers, banks, and other nominees certain expenses they incur for such activities. Citi has retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902, a proxy soliciting firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, for an estimated fee of $30,000 plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.
Householding
Under SEC rules, a single set of Annual Reports and Proxy Statements may be sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces mailing and printing expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain stockholders who shared a single address, only one Annual Report and Proxy Statement will be sent to that address unless any stockholder at that address requested multiple sets of documents be sent. However, if any stockholder who agreed to householding wishes to receive a separate Annual Report or Proxy Statement, he or she may telephone toll-free 1-866-540-7095 or write to Broadridge Financial Services, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Stockholders sharing an address who wish to receive a single set of reports may do so by contacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial holders, or by contacting Broadridge at the address set forth above, if they are record holders.

Glossary
CCAR refers to the Federal Reserve Board's annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. CCAR is an important regulatory supervisory mechanism for assessing the capital adequacy of banks including, among other things, ensuring that banks have sufficient capital to continue to provide key financial services under adverse economic and financial market scenarios. Banks may not return capital to stockholders or take other capital actions unless the Federal Reserve Board indicates that it has "no objection" to a bank's capital plan, including its requested capital actions.
Cumulative Earnings Per Share for our Performance Share Units is determined by adding the diluted earnings per share based on net income allocated to common stockholders from our quarterly earnings reports for the 12 quarters of the applicable three-year performance period.
Efficiency Ratio is total operating expenses divided by total revenues (net of interest expense). This ratio generally compares the cost of generating revenue to the amount of revenue generated. A lower cost is preferable to a higher cost in generating the same amount of revenue, and therefore, a lower efficiency ratio is generally better than a higher one. This metric encourages management to consider the costs of generating additional revenue instead of simply maximizing revenue, and can be used on a relative basis to identify which businesses are managed better than others.
Income from Continuing Operations Before Taxes is revenues minus expenses and cost of credit, before taxes and discontinued operations.
Net Income represents a company's after-tax profits. Net Income is an element of the metrics that measure return on assets or capital.
Return on Assets (ROA) is net income divided by average assets as determined under U.S. GAAP.
Return on Tangible Common Equity is net income for a business or Citigroup (minus preferred dividends in the case of Citigroup) divided by average tangible common equity for the year. Management views this metric as an appropriate indication of the long-term potential of Citi's operating businesses to deliver long-term value to stockholders.
Risk Appetite Ratio is the ratio between the earnings of a business unit, including expected losses (defined as revenues, net of interest expense, minus operating expenses, minus expected losses) (the numerator) and the stress losses (i.e., unexpected losses) of Citi or the applicable business segment under a 1-in-10 year stress scenario (the denominator). The applicable business unit should produce sufficient earnings each year, so that it does not lose money under a moderate stress event (i.e., a 1-in-10 year stress scenario). As long as the relationship is higher than 1-to-1, then the business unit "passes" the Risk Appetite Ratio test. The Risk Appetite Ratio is currently viewed as a baseline standard or a minimum goal.
Risk Appetite Surplus, for a business unit, is earnings (defined as revenues, net of interest expense, minus operating expenses) minus both expected losses and unexpected losses (i.e., the stress losses of the business unit under a 1-in-10 year stress scenario). The Risk Appetite Surplus metric is intended to measure the ability of a business unit to withstand a moderate stress event without incurring an annual loss. Risk Appetite Surplus is used as a more nuanced qualitative tool to evaluate the capital generation power of businesses that may "pass" the Risk Appetite Ratio test.

1. Purpose
The purposes of the Citigroup 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the "Plan") are to (i) align incentive compensation programs with the Company's long-term business objectives and the interests of stockholders; (ii) attract and retain Employees by providing compensation opportunities that are competitive within the global financial services industry; and (iii) provide compensation opportunities that do not create incentives to take imprudent risks.

 6. Available Shares of Common Stock   
 (a)  Shares Subject to the Plan. Common Stock issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan may be shares that have been authorized but unissued, or have been previously issued and reacquired by the Company, or both. Reacquired shares may consist of shares purchased in open market transactions or otherwise. Pursuant to and subject to the other provisions of this Section 6, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed the sum of (i) thirty million (30,000,000) shares; and (ii) any additional number of shares that may be authorized for issuance pursuant to any amendments to the Plan approved by stockholders of the Company after the Effective Date.

Awards granted under the Plan or the Prior Plans that, after the Effective Date, are forfeited, expire, or are cancelled or settled without issuance of shares shall not count against the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a) and shall be available for future Awards under the Plan.

(c)  Other Items not Included in Allocation. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a) shall not be affected by (i) the payment in cash of dividends or dividend equivalents in connection with outstanding Awards; or (ii) the grant of Substitute Awards. Any shares purchased by or on behalf of Participants in a dividend reinvestment program established under the Plan shall not count against the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a), provided that such shares are purchased in open-market transactions or are treasury shares purchased directly from the Company at Fair Market Value at the time of purchase.

  Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan as set forth in Section 6(a), and (ii) the maximum number of shares that may be granted to any single individual pursuant to the limits set forth in  Section 5(d). In the event of any extraordinary dividend, divestiture, or other distribution (other than ordinary cash dividends) of assets to stockholders, or any transaction or event described above, to the extent necessary to prevent the enlargement  or diminution of the rights of Participants, the Committee shall make appropriate equitable adjustments to the number or kind of shares subject to an outstanding Award, the exercise price applicable to an outstanding Award, and/or a Performance  Condition. Any adjustments under this Section 6(d) shall be made in a manner that does not adversely affect the exemption provided pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act, to the extent applicable. The Company shall give each Participant notice of an  adjustment to an Award hereunder and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall decline to adjust any Award made to a Participant if such adjustment would violate  applicable law. 
 7. Awards Under the Plan   
 Awards under the Plan may be granted as Options, SARs, or Stock Awards, as described below. Awards may be granted singly, in combination, or in tandem as determined by the Committee. Subject to the  terms of the Plan (including but not limited to the minimum vesting requirement of Section 7(d)), Awards shall have such terms, conditions, limitations, and restrictions as may be determined by the Committee from time to time, and may include vesting,  forfeiture, cancellation and clawback provisions.   
(a)  Options. Options shall expire after such period, not to exceed 10 years, as may be determined by the Committee. If an Option is exercisable in installments, such  installments or portions thereof that become exercisable shall remain exercisable until the Option expires or is otherwise cancelled pursuant to its terms or the terms of the Plan. In no event shall any Option issued under the Plan be a  "reload" Option or carry any similar rights.   
 (i)  Exercise Price. The Committee shall determine the exercise price per share for each Option, which shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the  grant date, unless the Option is a Substitute Award.   
 (ii)  Exercise of Options. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions relating to vesting and exercisability, as determined by the Committee, and upon provision  for the payment in full of the exercise price and applicable taxes due, the Participant shall be entitled to exercise the Option and receive the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in connection with the Option exercise. The shares issued in  connection with the Option exercise may be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Committee may determine, from time to time. An Option may be exercised by any method as may be permitted by the Committee from time to time, including but not  limited to any "net exercise" or other "cashless" exercise method.   
(b)  Stock Appreciation Rights. SARs granted under the Plan shall expire after such term, not to exceed 10 years, as may be determined by the Committee. The exercise  price per share of Common Stock subject to a SAR shall not be less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the grant date, unless the SAR is a Substitute Award.   
(c)  Stock Awards   
 (i)  Stock Payment. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee may grant vested shares of Common Stock as a Stock Payment. A Stock Payment may be in lieu of cash  compensation, but may be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer, or cancellation and recoupment, as determined by the Committee. A Stock Payment under the Plan may be granted as, or in payment of, a bonus determined pursuant to any other plan. Any  shares of Common Stock granted as a Stock Payment in lieu of cash compensation shall be valued at their Fair Market Value.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 (ii)  Restricted Stock. Unvested shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award shall be entitled to voting rights as provided in Section 9, unless determined otherwise by the Committee. Upon satisfaction of all conditions to vesting and any tax withholding obligations, and upon the lapse of any post-vesting restrictions on sale or transfer, shares of Common Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award shall be delivered to a Participant free of restriction.   
 (iii)  Deferred Stock. A Deferred Stock Award represents only an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver shares of Common Stock in the future and does not give a Participant any greater rights than those of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. Upon satisfaction of all conditions to vesting and any tax withholding obligations, shares of Common Stock subject to a vested Deferred Stock Award will be issued, and upon the lapse of any post-vesting restrictions on sale or transfer, such shares of Common Stock will be delivered to a Participant free of restriction.   
 (iv)  Other Stock-Based Awards. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may grant any other Award that is denominated in shares of Common Stock and that may be settled in cash and/ or by the delivery of shares of Common Stock (for the avoidance of doubt, an award that by its terms may be settled only in cash shall not be an Award under this Plan).   
(d)  Minimum Vesting Requirement. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, Awards granted under the Plan shall vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the Award is granted; provided, that the following Awards shall not be subject to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement: any (i) Substitute Awards, (ii) Awards to Directors that vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, and (iii) any additional Awards the Committee may grant, up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 6(a) (subject to adjustment under Section 6(d)); and, provided, further, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any Award, including in cases of retirement, death, disability, leave of absence, termination of employment, Change in Control, upon the sale or other disposition of a Participant's employer, or any other similar event, as specified in the Award Agreement.   
(e)  Performance-Based Awards   
 (i)  The Committee may grant Awards that are subject to the achievement of one or more Performance Conditions related to a period of performance of not less than one year.   
 (ii)  Performance Conditions may be expressed in either, or a combination of, absolute or relative values or a percentage of: revenue, revenue or product growth, net income (pre- or after-tax), earnings, earnings per share, stockholders' equity or return on stockholders' equity, assets or return on assets, return on risk-adjusted assets, capital or return on capital, return on risk capital, book value or book value per share, economic value-added models or equivalent metrics, operating income, pre- or after-tax income, expenses or reengineering savings, margins, cash flow or cash flow per share, stock price, total shareholder return, market share, debt reduction, net promoter scores, operating efficiency ratios, expense ratios, liquidity ratios, regulatory achievements or any objective or subjective Performance Conditions selected by the Committee. In addition, such Performance Conditions may be used on an absolute or relative basis to measure the performance of the Company as a whole, any business unit(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or one or more of its branches or affiliates, or the performance of an individual Participant, and may be used in any combination as the Committee may deem appropriate. Such Performance Conditions may also be based on performance determined on a per share basis (either basic or fully diluted) and/or as compared to the performance of a group of peer or comparator companies, prior performance periods, a published or special index or indices that the Committee deems appropriate, or such other measures selected or defined by the Committee at the time such Performance Conditions are established. 
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
 (iii)  The Committee may make objectively determinable adjustments, modifications, or amendments to any Performance Condition as the Committee deems appropriate, including (but not limited to) with respect to items determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence, or that are related to discontinued operations, the disposal of a business or assets, or a change in accounting principle under GAAP, or that are attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary during a relevant performance period.      
(f)  Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any fractional shares of Common Stock in settlement of Awards granted under the Plan. If an Award includes or results in an entitlement to a fractional share for any reason, the Award shall be settled in full by issuance of the maximum whole number of shares of Common Stock the Participant is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the Award (upon satisfaction of all applicable conditions to the issuance of shares) and the Company may cancel the fractional share without any compensation to the Participant.   
[END TABLE]
8. Dividends and Dividend Equivalents
The Committee may provide that Stock Awards shall earn dividends or dividend equivalents. Such dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid currently or may be credited to an account maintained on the books of the Company. Any payment or crediting of dividends or dividend equivalents will be subject to such terms, conditions, limitations, and restrictions as the Committee may establish, from time to time, including, without limitation, reinvestment in additional shares of Common Stock or common share equivalents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not provide for the current payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award with a Performance Condition; for such Awards, the Committee may only provide for the accrual of dividends or dividend equivalents that will not be payable to a Participant unless and until, and only to the extent that, the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award vest upon satisfaction of the relevant Performance Condition and all other applicable conditions to vesting. Dividend or dividend equivalent rights shall be as specified in the Award Agreement, or pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Committee with respect to outstanding Awards. No dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on Options or SARs.   
9. Voting
Unless the Committee has determined otherwise, a Participant shall have the right to direct the vote of shares of Common Stock subject to an unvested Restricted Stock Award. Unvested shares of Common Stock that are eligible to vote shall be voted by a Plan Administrator in accordance with instructions received from Participants (unless to do so would constitute a violation of any applicable exchange rules). Shares subject to unvested Restricted Stock Awards as to which no instructions are received shall be voted by the Plan Administrator proportionately in accordance with instructions received with respect to all other unvested Restricted Stock Awards (including, for these purposes, outstanding awards granted under the Prior Plans and any other "non-qualified" stock incentive plan of the Company) that are eligible to vote (unless to do so would constitute a violation of any applicable exchange rules).   
10. Nontransferability
Awards granted under the Plan, and during any period of restriction on transferability, shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or vesting of a Stock Award, may not be sold, pledged, hypothecated, assigned, margined, or otherwise transferred by a Participant in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares underlying such Award have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed or have been waived by the Committee. No Award or interest or right therein shall be subject to the debts, contracts, or engagements of a Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment, or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, by judgment, lien, levy, attachment, garnishment, or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy and divorce), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void, of no effect, and not binding on the Company in any way.

Table of Contents
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit Options and/or shares issued in connection with an Option or a SAR exercise that are subject to restrictions on transferability to be transferred one time and without payment or consideration to a member of a Participant's immediate family or to a trust or similar vehicle for the benefit of a Participant's immediate family members. During the lifetime of a Participant, all rights with respect to Awards shall be exercisable only by such Participant or, if applicable pursuant to the preceding sentence, a permitted transferee.  
11. Change of Control of the Company
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  The Committee may, at the time an Award is made or at any time prior to, coincident with, or after the time of a Change of Control:   
 (i)  provide for the adjustment of any Performance Conditions as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the Change of Control;   
 (ii)  provide for the cancellation of any Awards then outstanding if the surviving entity or acquiring entity (or the surviving or acquiring entity's parent company) in the Change of Control replaces the Awards with new rights of substantially equivalent value, as determined by the Committee;   
 (iii)  provide that upon an involuntary termination of a Participant's employment as a result of a Change of Control, any time periods shall accelerate, and any other conditions relating to the vesting, exercise, payment, or distribution of an Award shall be waived; or   
 (iv)  provide that Awards shall be purchased for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained for the shares covered by a Stock Award if it had been vested or by an Option or SAR if it had been exercised at the time of the Change of Control. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, the vesting, payment, purchase, or distribution of an Award may not be accelerated by reason of a Change of Control for any Participant unless the Participant's employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of the Change of Control. For purposes of this Section 11, a Participant's employment will be deemed to have been involuntarily terminated as a result of a Change of Control if it is involuntarily terminated other than for Gross Misconduct at any time beginning on the date of the Change of Control up to and including the first anniversary of the Change of Control.   
(c)  A "Change of Control" shall be deemed to occur if and when:   
 (i)  any person, including a "person" as such term is used in Section 14(d)(2) of the 1934 Act (a "Person"), is or becomes a beneficial owner (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities;   
 (ii)  individuals who, as of the Effective Date, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the Effective Date whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board, shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding for this purpose any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the 1934 Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board;

12. Award Agreements
Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement (as such may be amended from time to time) that sets forth the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations applicable to the Award, including, but not limited to, the provisions governing vesting, exercisability, payment, forfeiture, cancellation, and termination of employment, all or some of which may be incorporated by reference into one or more other documents delivered or otherwise made available to a Participant in connection with an Award. The Committee need not require the formal execution or acceptance of such document by the Participant, in which case acceptance of any benefit of the Award by the Participant shall constitute agreement by the Participant to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations set forth in the Plan and the Award Agreement as well as the administrative guidelines and practices of the Company in effect from time to time. Any assertion by an Employee that any term, condition, limitation, or restriction of the Award as specified in the Award Agreement is invalid or not binding on such Employee because of his or her non-acceptance of the Award Agreement (or any portion thereof) shall be deemed a refusal of the Award and the Employee shall cease to be a Participant with respect to the Award, which shall be immediately cancelled. Each Award Agreement shall provide for forfeiture or cancellation of unvested Awards if it is determined that a Participant engaged in Gross Misconduct on or prior to a vesting date.
13. Tax Withholding
Participants shall be solely responsible for any applicable taxes (including without limitation income, payroll, and excise taxes) and penalties, and any interest that accrues thereon, which they incur under applicable law in connection with the receipt, vesting, or exercise of any Award. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right to require payment of, or may deduct from any payment made under the Plan or otherwise to a Participant, or may permit or require shares to be tendered or sold (including shares of Common Stock delivered or vested in connection with an Award) in an amount sufficient to cover withholding of, any federal, state, local, foreign, or other governmental taxes or charges required by law, or hypothetical taxes required to be paid by a Participant pursuant to a tax-equalization policy for expatriate employees, and to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy any such withholding or payment obligations. The value of any shares allowed to be withheld or tendered for tax withholding may not exceed the amount allowed consistent with fixed plan accounting in accordance with GAAP, to the extent applicable. To the extent that a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to satisfy a tax withholding obligation of the Company may not be withheld (whether because the Award has not vested in full pursuant to its terms, administrative procedures in effect at such time, applicable accounting principles, or any other reason), it shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an Option or a SAR, or in settlement of any vested Award, that a Participant pay to the Company, on demand, such amount as may be requested by the Company for the purpose of satisfying any actual tax withholding (or hypothetical tax) liability. If the amount is not timely paid to the Company in cash by such Participant, the Company may cancel the Award and refuse to issue such shares.

15. Other Benefit and Compensation Programs
Awards granted under the Plan and amounts received upon vesting or exercise of an Award shall not be deemed a part of a Participant's regular, recurring compensation for purposes of calculating payments or benefits under any Company benefit plan or severance program unless specifically provided for under the plan or program. Unless specifically set forth in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan are not intended as payment for compensation that otherwise would have been delivered in cash, and even if so intended, such Awards shall be subject to such vesting requirements and other terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
16. Unfunded Plan
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Plan shall be unfunded and shall not create (or be construed to create) a trust or a separate fund or funds. The Plan shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant or other person. To the extent that any Participant holds any rights by virtue of an Award granted under the Plan, such rights shall constitute general unsecured liabilities of the Company and shall not confer upon any Participant or any other person or entity any right, title, or interest in any assets of the Company.
17. Expenses of the Plan
The expenses of the administration of the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may require Subsidiaries to pay for the Common Stock issued under the Plan to Participants employed (or formerly employed) by such Subsidiaries.
18. Rights as a Stockholder
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant shall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to shares of Common Stock covered by an Award until the date the Participant becomes the holder of record with respect to such shares. No adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to such date, except as provided in Section 6(d) or Section 8.

19. Future Rights
No Employee shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan. There shall be no obligation of uniformity of treatment of Employees under the Plan. Further, the Company and its Subsidiaries may adopt other compensation programs, plans, or arrangements as they deem appropriate or necessary. The adoption of the Plan or the granting of any Award shall not confer upon any Employee any right to continued employment in any particular position or at any particular rate of compensation, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or a Subsidiary to terminate the employment of its Employees at any time, free from any claim or liability under the Plan. Unless expressly provided otherwise elsewhere in the Plan or in an Award Agreement, Awards under the Plan shall be made in anticipation of future service and/or subject to other vesting conditions and will not be earned until all conditions to vesting have been satisfied.
20. Amendment and Termination
The Plan may be amended, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Committee, provided that no amendment shall be made without stockholder approval, if it would (a) materially increase the number of shares available under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section 6(d)), (b) materially expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) materially extend the term of the Plan, (e) materially change the method of determining the exercise price of an Award, (f) delete or limit the Plan's prohibition against Repricing, or (g) otherwise require approval by the stockholders of the Company in order to comply with applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (or, if the Common Stock is not traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the principal national securities exchange upon which the Common Stock is then traded or quoted). No such amendment referred to above shall be effective unless and until it has been approved by the stockholders of the Company. The Committee retains the right to modify an Award without a Participant's prior consent if it determines that the modification is required to comply with applicable law, regulation, or regulatory guidance (including applicable tax law). Except as may be provided by Section 7(e), Section 11, and this Section 20, any other adverse modification shall not be effective without the Participant's written consent. The Company shall furnish or make available to Participants a written notice of any modification through a brochure, prospectus supplement, or otherwise, which notice shall specify the effective date of such modification.
21. Successors and Assigns
The Plan and any applicable Award Agreement entered into under the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of Participants, including, without limitation, the executors, administrators, or trustees of a Participant's estate, or any receiver or trustee in bankruptcy or representative of a Participant's creditors.
22. Governing Law
The Plan and all Award Agreements entered into under the Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York, except that any principles or provisions of New York law that would apply the law of another jurisdiction (other than applicable provisions of U.S. federal law) shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, matters with respect to indemnification, delegation of authority under the Plan, and the legality of shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan, shall be governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
23. Tax Compliance
Awards granted hereunder shall comply with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to receive a payment on a specified date, such payment shall be deemed made as of such specified date if it is made (a) not earlier than 30 days before such specified date, and (b) not later than December 31 of the year in which such specified date occurs or, if later, the fifteenth day of the third month following such specified www.citigroup.com
Table of Contents date; provided that the Participant shall not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year in which such payment is made. If, pursuant to any Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, a Participant is entitled to a series of installment payments, such Participant's right to the series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments and not as a right to a single payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "series of installment payments" has the same meaning as provided in Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the regulations promulgated under the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or any Subsidiary be liable to a Participant on account of an Award's failure to (a) qualify for favorable U.S. or foreign tax treatment, or (b) avoid adverse tax treatment under U.S. or foreign law, including, without limitation, Sections 409A and 457A of the Code.
24. Severability
If any provision of this Plan is finally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability, and the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby; provided that, if any such provision is finally held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope determined to be acceptable to permit such provision to be enforceable, such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary in order to make such provision enforceable.
