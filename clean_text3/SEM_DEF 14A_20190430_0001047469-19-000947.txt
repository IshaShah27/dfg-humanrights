    PROXY SOLICITATION AND VOTING INFORMATION         
         Your vote is very important.    In accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"),  instead of mailing a printed copy of the Company's proxy materials to each stockholder of record, the Company may furnish proxy materials including this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Annual Report") to the Company's stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet. Stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless requested. Instead, the Notice will instruct stockholders as to how they may access and review all of the proxy materials. The Notice also instructs stockholders how to submit a proxy through the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper copy or e-mail copy of your proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. The Company will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. If you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges you may incur. 
        You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by written notice to the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company, by submission of a proxy bearing a later date or by casting a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Properly executed and delivered proxies that are received before the Annual Meeting's adjournment will be voted in accordance with the directions provided or, if no directions are provided, your shares will be voted by one of the individuals named on your proxy card as recommended by the Board of Directors. If you wish to give a proxy to someone other than those named on the proxy card, you should cross out those names and insert the name(s) of the person(s), not more than three, to whom you wish to give your proxy. 
        If you want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting and you hold shares of Company common stock in street name, you must obtain a proxy card from your broker and bring that proxy card to the Annual Meeting, together with a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date, which is March 4, 2019. 
         Who can vote?    Stockholders as of the close of business on March 4, 2019 are entitled to vote. On that day, 135,276,199 shares of common stock were outstanding and eligible to vote, and there were 123 registered holders. Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting. A list of stockholders eligible to vote will be available at the offices of Select Medical Holdings Corporation, 4714 Gettysburg Road, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania beginning April 20, 2019. Stockholders may examine this list during normal business hours for any purpose relating to the Annual Meeting. 
        How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote?    The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR each Board of Directors nominee, FOR the approval of the executive compensation resolution and FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
         What is the difference between "stockholder of record" and holder of stock in "street name"?    If your shares are registered directly in your name with our Transfer Agent and Registrar, Computershare Inc., you are a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a holder of stock in street name. As a holder of stock in street name, you have the right to instruct your broker, bank, trustee or nominee how to vote your shares. If you do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then under applicable rules, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote your shares in their discretion on "routine" matters but cannot vote on "non-routine" matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
        Which proposals are "routine" and "non-routine"?    The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3) is considered a routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal 3. Each of the other proposals, including the election of directors (Proposal 1), the non-binding advisory vote on the  Table of Contents compensation of our name executive officers (Proposal 2) and any additional stockholder proposals are considered non-routine matters under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposals 1 and 2. 
         What shares are included in the proxy card?    Each proxy card you receive represents all the shares of common stock registered to you in that particular account. You may receive more than one proxy card if you hold shares that are either registered differently or in more than one account. Each share of common stock that you own entitles you to one vote. 
         How do I vote by proxy?    Most stockholders have three ways to vote by proxy: by telephone, via the Internet or by returning the proxy card. To vote by telephone or via the Internet, follow the instructions set forth on each proxy card you receive. To vote by mail, sign and date each proxy card you receive, mark the boxes indicating how you wish to vote and return the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Do not return the proxy card if you vote via the Internet or by telephone. 
        How are votes counted?    The Annual Meeting will be held if a quorum, consisting of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote, is represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Broker non-votes, votes withheld and abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been reached. With respect to Proposal 1, because directors are elected by a majority vote, meaning the votes validly cast for such nominee's election exceeds the votes validly cast against such nominee's election in such election, in uncontested elections, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as a vote cast either for or against such director's election. Because Proposals 2 and 3 require for approval the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote, any abstentions will have the effect of votes against and any broker non-votes will not have any effect on these proposals. 
         Who will count the vote?    The Company's Transfer Agent and Registrar, Computershare Inc., will tally the vote. 
         Is my vote confidential?    Yes. All stockholder meeting proxies, ballots and tabulations that identify individual stockholders are kept confidential and are not available for examination, except: (1) as required by law, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. 
         Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?    The Company intends to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. Final voting results will be tallied by the Company's Transfer Agent and Registrar after the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. The Company will publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days following the Annual Meeting. 
        Who is soliciting this proxy?    Solicitation of proxies is made on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company will pay the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing or otherwise making available the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and the notice of the Annual Meeting, proxy statement and proxy card. In addition to the use of mail, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and regular employees of the Company, without additional compensation, in person or by telephone or other electronic means. The Company will reimburse brokerage houses and other nominees for their expenses in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners of the Company's common stock. 
        What if I can't attend the meeting?    If you are unable to attend the meeting in person and you intend to vote, you must vote your shares by proxy, via the Internet or by telephone by the applicable deadline.  Table of Contents
    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE         
        In accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Company's business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. Although the Company's non-management directors are not involved in the day-to-day operating details, they are kept informed of the Company's business through written reports and documents provided to them regularly, as well as by operating, financial and other reports presented by the officers of the Company at meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors. 
   Independence  
        In 2018, the Board of Directors undertook a review of the independence of the Company's directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with the Company that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. The Board of Directors has determined that eight of the Company's ten current directors are "independent" as defined in the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). The following directors were determined to be independent: Russell L. Carson, Bryan C. Cressey, James S. Ely III, William H. Frist, Harold L. Paz, Marilyn B. Tavenner, Thomas A. Scully and Leopold Swergold. 
        In making this determination, the Board of Directors considered the Company's investment in Concentra Group Holdings Parent, LLC, a joint venture. A fund affiliated with Bryan C. Cressey and William H. Frist and a separate fund affiliated with Russell L. Carson and Thomas A. Scully are also investors in Concentra Group Holdings Parent, LLC, and Mr. Cressey currently serves on the board of directors of Concentra Group Holdings Parent, LLC; however, the Board of Directors believes these are not material relationships with the Company and will not affect the ability of Mr. Cressey, Dr. Frist, Mr. Carson and Mr. Scully to be independent from management. The Board of Directors also considered Harold L. Paz's employment as an executive officer of Aetna, Inc., from which the Company receives payments in the ordinary course of business; however, the Board of Directors believes this is not a material relationship with the Company and will not affect the ability of Dr. Paz to be independent from management. 
   Lead Director  
        In 2015, the Board determined that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to designate an independent director to serve in a lead capacity (the "Lead Director"). The independent directors of the Board of Directors recommended Russell L. Carson to serve as Lead Director, and the Board of Directors elected Mr. Carson to that position. The Lead Director's responsibilities include, but are not limited to: (i) consulting with the Chairman of the Board of Directors to include on the agenda for Board of Directors meetings any matters requested by the Lead Director; (ii) presiding at meetings of the Board of Directors in the absence of, or upon the request of, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, including presiding over all executive sessions of the independent directors; (iii) serving as liaison between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the independent directors; (iv) approving meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; (v) having the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; (vi) coordinating the agenda for moderating sessions of the independent directors of the Board of Directors; and (vii) being available for direct communication from significant stockholders. The role and responsibility of the Lead Director is set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. Please note that none of the information on the Company's website is incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement. 
   Meetings of the Board of Directors and Stockholders  
        It is the policy of the Board of Directors to meet at least quarterly. The Board of Directors held four meetings in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, each of the then-current directors attended all of the meetings of the Board of Directors and all of the meetings of any committee of which they were a member. It is also the policy of the Board of Directors that the independent members of the Board of Directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions of the Board of Directors without management. As described above under the heading "Lead Director," the Lead Director serves as the presiding director over such executive  Table of Contents sessions. In addition, the Company's directors are expected to attend annual meetings of stockholders, and all of the Company's directors who were serving as directors at the time of the 2018 annual meeting attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
   Corporate Governance Matters  
        The Board of Directors adopted corporate governance guidelines in September 2009, as amended from time to time, which can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. Under these guidelines, directors are expected to advise the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to accepting any other public company directorship or any assignment to the audit committee or compensation committee of the board of directors of any public company of which such director is a member. Directors are also expected to report changes in their business or professional affiliations or responsibilities, including retirement, to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. A director is expected to offer to resign if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee concludes that the director no longer meets the Company's requirements for service on the Board of Directors. There are no pre-determined limitations on the number of other boards of directors on which the Company's directors may serve; however, the Board of Directors expects individual directors to use their judgment in accepting other directorships and to allow sufficient time and attention to Company matters. There are no set term limits for directors. As an alternative to term limits, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review each director's continuation on the Board of Directors every three years. 
   Communications with the Board of Directors  
        If you would like to communicate with all of the Company's directors, please send a letter to the following address: Select Medical Holdings Corporation, Attention: Board of Directors c/o Michael E. Tarvin, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 4714 Gettysburg Road, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 17055. The Company's Secretary will forward such communication to each of the members of the Board of Directors. 
        If you would like to communicate with the independent members of the Board of Directors, including the Lead Director, please send a letter to the following address: Select Medical Holdings Corporation, Attention: Lead Director c/o Michael E. Tarvin, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 4714 Gettysburg Road, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 17055. The Company's Secretary will forward such communication to the independent members of the Board of Directors. 
   Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics  
        The Company is committed to ethical business practices. In 1998, Select Medical Corporation, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary ("Select"), voluntarily adopted a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is reviewed and amended as necessary and is the basis for the Company's compliance program. The Code of Conduct provides guidelines for principles and regulatory rules that are applicable to the Company's patient care and business activities. These guidelines are implemented by a compliance officer, a compliance committee, and employee education and training. The Company has also established a reporting system, auditing and monitoring programs, and a disciplinary system as a means for enforcing the Code of Conduct's policies. This Code of Conduct applies to all of the Company's employees and directors. In September 2009, the Company adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which includes the code of ethics for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer within the meaning of the SEC regulations adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. Any amendments to the Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers or waivers from the provisions of the Code of Conduct or the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer will be disclosed on the Company's website promptly following the date of such amendment or waiver.

   Board Leadership  
        The Board of Directors does not have a formal policy on whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be separate. However, since its inception, the Company has had separate individuals serve in those positions. The Company's Board of Directors is led by Robert A. Ortenzio as Executive Chairman and David S. Chernow as Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors has carefully considered its leadership structure and believes at this time that the Company and its stockholders are best served by having the positions of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer filled by different individuals. This allows the Chief Executive Officer to, among other things, focus on the Company's day-to-day business, while allowing the Executive Chairman to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice and oversight of management. Further, the Board of Directors believes that having the Executive Chairman serve dual roles as chairman of the Board of Directors and as an executive officer of the Company promotes information flow between management and the Board of Directors, effective decision making and an alignment of corporate strategy. Moreover, the Board of Directors believes that its other structural features, including eight independent directors and eight non-management directors on a board consisting of ten directors, an independent director serving as Lead Director, regular meetings of independent directors in executive session and key committees consisting wholly of independent directors, provide for substantial independent oversight of the Company's management. However, the Board of Directors recognizes that depending on future circumstances, other leadership models may become more appropriate. Accordingly, the Board of Directors will continue to periodically review its leadership structure. 
   Risk Oversight  
        The Company faces a number of risks, including regulatory risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, reputational risk and risk from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks faced by the Company, while the Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors seeks to ensure that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate. The Board of Directors periodically consults with management regarding the Company's risks. 
        While the Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, the Company's four board committees assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. The Audit and Compliance Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing risk management in the areas of financial reporting, internal controls and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and periodically reviews with management, internal auditors and independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's policies for assessing and managing risk. The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in oversight and management of risks related to the Company's compensation policies and programs. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in oversight and management of risk associated with board organization, membership and structure, succession planning for our directors and officers and corporate governance. The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee assists the Board of Directors in the oversight and management of risk associated with the Company's policies and procedures relating to the delivery of quality medical care to patients. 
   Committees of the Board of Directors  
        The Board of Directors currently has four standing committees. Charters for each of these committees can be found on the Company's website at  www.selectmedicalholdings.com. 
         Audit and Compliance Committee—The Audit and Compliance Committee is governed by a written charter adopted in February 2010. The primary responsibility of the Audit and Compliance Committee is to oversee the Company's financial reporting process and compliance program on behalf of the Board of Directors and to regularly report the results of its activities to the Board of Directors. The Audit and Compliance Committee assists the Board of Directors in the oversight of (i) the integrity of the Company's financial statements and financial reporting process; (ii) the systems of internal accounting and financial controls; (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors; (iv) the  Table of Contents independent auditor's qualifications and independence; (v) the annual independent audit of the Company's financial statements; (vi) the selection and performance of the Company's compliance officer; (vii) the effectiveness of the structure and operations of the Company's compliance program; (viii) the Company's compliance with each of the Company's Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and other legal compliance and ethics programs established by management and the Board of Directors; and (ix) the Company's compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In so doing, the Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for maintaining free and open communication among its members, the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and the Company's management. A detailed list of the Audit and Compliance Committee's functions is included in its charter. The Audit and Compliance Committee charter is annually reviewed and ratified by the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors. 
        The current members of the Audit and Compliance Committee are Messrs. Ely, Frist, Swergold and Ms. Tavenner. Mr. Ely currently serves as the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee. The composition of the Audit and Compliance Committee satisfies the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and the SEC. The financial literacy standards require that each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. In addition, at least one member of the Audit and Compliance Committee must qualify as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC, and have financial sophistication in accordance with the rules of the NYSE. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Audit and Compliance Committee members qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. Also, each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee is independent, as independence for audit committee members is defined in the applicable NYSE listing standards. The Audit and Compliance Committee held six meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
         Compensation Committee—The Compensation Committee is governed by a written charter adopted in May 2013, as amended and restated in February 2018. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating and approving the Company's executive officer and director compensation plans, policies and programs, as well as all equity-based compensation plans and policies. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for preparing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis report for inclusion in the Company's annual proxy statement filed with the SEC. The Compensation Committee charter is annually reviewed and ratified by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. 
        The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Cressey, Scully and Swergold, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined in its business judgment are independent as defined in the applicable NYSE listing standards. Mr. Cressey currently serves as the chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
        Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee—The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is governed by a written charter adopted in February 2010. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is appointed to (i) identify individuals qualified to serve on the Board of Directors and board committees; (ii) recommend to the Board of Directors nominees for election to the Board of Directors at annual meetings of stockholders; (iii) recommend to the Board of Directors nominees to serve on each of the board committees; (iv) lead the Board of Directors in its annual review of the performance of the Board of Directors and management; (v) monitor the Company's corporate governance structure; and (vi) develop and recommend to the Board of Directors any proposed changes to the Company's corporate governance guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies individuals, including those recommended by stockholders, believed to be qualified as candidates for Board of Directors membership. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to retain search firms to assist it in identifying candidates to serve as directors. Marilyn B. Tavenner was identified and recommended as a potential director nominee to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by an executive officer of the Company. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and after taking into account the background, qualifications and other factors discussed below, the Board of Directors increased the size of the Board of Directors from nine directors to ten directors and voted in November 2018 to elect Ms. Tavenner as a director of the Company. In addition to any other qualifications the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may in its discretion deem appropriate, all director candidates, at a minimum, should possess the highest personal and professional  Table of Contents ethics, integrity and values and be committed to representing the best interests of the stockholders. In identifying candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also take into account other factors it considers appropriate, which include ensuring a majority of directors satisfy the independence requirements of the NYSE, the SEC or other appropriate governing body and that the Board of Directors as a whole is comprised of directors who have the appropriate experience, expertise and perspective that will enhance the quality of the Board of Directors' deliberations and decisions. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors believe it is essential that the Board of Directors is able to draw on a wide variety of backgrounds and professional experiences among its members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee desires to maintain the Board of Directors' diversity through the consideration of factors such as education, skills, relevant professional experience, gender, and racial and ethnic background. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not intend to nominate representational directors, but instead considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials in the context of these standards and the characteristics of the Board of Directors in its entirety. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will conduct appropriate inquiries with respect to the backgrounds and qualifications of all director candidates. Once the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has completed its review of a candidate's qualifications and conducted the appropriate inquiries, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a determination whether to recommend the candidate for approval by the Board of Directors. If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides to recommend the director candidate for nomination by the Board of Directors and such recommendation is accepted by the Board of Directors, the form of proxy solicited by the Company will include the name of the director candidate. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter is annually reviewed and ratified by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors. 
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers stockholder nominees for directors in the same manner as nominees for director from other sources. Stockholder suggestions for nominees for director should be submitted to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary no later than the date by which stockholder proposals for action must be submitted and should include the following information: (i) the name and address of the stockholder making the recommendations, (ii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record, which should include the number of shares presently held and how long the shares have been held, (iii) a description of any and all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder making the recommendation and the director candidate, and (iv) all information regarding the director candidate that is required to be included in a proxy solicitation for the election of directors. 
        The current members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. Ely and Carson, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined in its business judgment are independent as defined in the applicable NYSE listing standards. Mr. Ely currently serves as the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
         Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee—The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee is governed by a written charter adopted in May 2012. The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee is appointed to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the review of the Company's policies and procedures relating to the delivery of quality medical care to patients. The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee maintains communication between the Board of Directors and the senior officers with management responsibility for medical care and reviews matters concerning or relating to the quality of medical care delivered to patients, efforts to advance the quality of medical care provided and patient safety. The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee charter is annually reviewed and ratified by the Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee and the Board of Directors. 
        The current members of the Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee are Dr. Frist, Dr. Paz and Ms. Tavenner. Dr. Frist currently serves as the chairman of the Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee. The Quality of Care and Patient Safety Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2018.

    COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT         
        The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is composed entirely of independent directors, and currently consists of Messrs. Cressey, Scully and Swergold. Mr. Cressey currently serves as the chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Cressey, Scully and Swergold are each independent under the NYSE listing standards currently in effect. The Compensation Committee administers the Company's executive and director compensation programs. The role of the Compensation Committee is to oversee the Company's compensation and benefit plans and policies, to administer the Company's equity plans (including reviewing and approving equity grants to officers and directors) and to review and approve annually all compensation decisions relating to directors and elected officers, including those for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (collectively, the "named executive officers" or the "NEOs"). The Compensation Committee works with management to develop relationships between pay levels, financial performance and returns to stockholders in order to align the Company's compensation structure with the Company's organizational objectives. The charter of the Compensation Committee authorizes the Compensation Committee to confer with management to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate to fulfill its responsibilities. 
        The Compensation Committee discharges the responsibilities of the Board of Directors relating to the compensation of the Company's executive officers and directors, including the NEOs. The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for evaluating and approving executive officer and director compensation plans and policies. The specific responsibilities and functions of the Compensation Committee are delineated in the charter of the Compensation Committee. 
   Compensation Consultant  
        The Compensation Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant during the 2018, 2017 or 2016 fiscal years. 
   Role of Executive Officers  
        At the request of the Compensation Committee, in 2018, Robert A. Ortenzio, the Company's Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, and David Chernow, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, participated in Compensation Committee meetings and recommended levels of compensation for the other NEOs. Additionally, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer participate in Compensation Committee meetings from time to time to discuss performance targets and results with the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee makes the final determination regarding the compensation of the NEOs. Other than the executive officers noted above, no other executive officers participate in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation. 
   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  
        No current member of the Compensation Committee is or has been at any time one of the Company's officers or employees. None of the Company's executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Company's Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 
   Compensation Committee Report  
        The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement with management, and based on the Compensation Committee's review and discussion with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section be included in this Proxy Statement.

    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS         
   Objectives of the Company's Executive Compensation Policy  
         Introduction.    This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides an overview of the Company's executive compensation program, together with a description of the material factors underlying the decisions which resulted in the compensation provided for 2018 to the Company's Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, Vice Chairman and Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, as presented in the tables which follow this CD&A. This CD&A contains statements regarding certain performance targets and goals the Company has used or may use to determine appropriate compensation. These targets and goals are disclosed in the limited context of the Company's compensation program and should not be understood to be statements of management's expectations or estimates of financial results or other guidance. The Company specifically cautions investors not to apply these statements to other contexts. 
         Compensation Philosophy.    The Company's compensation philosophy for NEOs is designed with the primary goals of rewarding the contributions of NEOs to the Company's financial performance and providing overall compensation sufficient to attract and retain highly skilled NEOs who are properly motivated to contribute to the Company's financial performance. The Company generally seeks to achieve its goals with respect to the NEOs' compensation by implementing and maintaining incentive plans for such executive officers that tie a substantial portion of each NEO's overall compensation to pre-determined financial goals relating to the Company's return on equity and earnings per share. The Compensation Committee also grants the NEOs restricted stock awards from time to time which, subject to limited exceptions, require the NEO's continued employment for a minimum of three years prior to vesting. 
        Committee Process.    The Compensation Committee meets as often as necessary to perform its duties and responsibilities. During 2018, the Compensation Committee met six times. The Compensation Committee's meeting agenda is normally established by the Company's Executive Chairman and Co-Founder in consultation with the chairman and members of the Compensation Committee. Members of the Compensation Committee receive the agenda and related materials in advance of each meeting. Depending on the meeting's agenda, such materials may include financial reports regarding the Company's performance, reports on achievement of individual and Company objectives and information regarding the Company's compensation programs. 
        The Compensation Committee periodically reviews overall compensation levels to ensure that performance-based compensation represents a sufficient portion of total compensation to promote and reward executive officers' contributions to the Company's performance. All members of the Compensation Committee have extensive experience in the healthcare industry, including a focus on structuring appropriate executive compensation for healthcare companies. In setting the compensation for the NEOs, the Compensation Committee members draw on their collective experience in the healthcare industry and knowledge of investors' goals and do not engage in benchmarking. For the 2018 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee believed that its historical approach to executive compensation decisions was appropriate and therefore did not engage a compensation consultant. 
        Role of Executive Officers.    At the request of the Compensation Committee, in 2018, Robert A. Ortenzio, the Company's Executive Chairman and Co-Founder, and David Chernow, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, participated in Compensation Committee meetings and recommended levels of compensation for the other NEOs. Additionally, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer participated in Compensation Committee meetings in 2018 to discuss performance targets and results with the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee makes the final determination regarding the compensation of the NEOs. Other than the executive officers noted above, no other executive officers participate in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation.  Table of Contents
   Risk Assessment  
        The Compensation Committee meets periodically each fiscal year to review the Company's executive compensation policies and programs to ensure that they are appropriate. The Compensation Committee also determines each year whether incentive compensation will be awarded to the Company's non-executive employees. After considering the various forms of compensation paid to the Company's employees, the Compensation Committee has concluded that the Company's compensation policies and programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This conclusion is based on the following factors:
   Consideration of Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation  
        In determining and approving the compensation of our NEOs, the Compensation Committee monitors the results of the Company's annual advisory vote on executive compensation. The Company's stockholders approved our executive compensation program at our last annual meeting (122,714,386 votes for approval, 2,301,208 votes against, 74,073 abstentions and 4,282,973 broker non-votes). Although this vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee viewed this endorsement of our executive compensation decisions and policies as an additional factor supporting the Compensation Committee's conclusion that our existing approach to executive compensation has been successful for the Company. 
        At our 2017 annual meeting, the Company's stockholders also voted that the advisory vote on executive compensation should be held once every year, consistent with past practice. Consistent with that vote, the Board of Directors resolved to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation once every year in connection with the Company's annual meeting of stockholders. 
   Stock Ownership Guidelines  
        In 2015, the Board of Directors approved a policy, by which the Company requires its NEOs to own a number of shares of the Company's common stock having a value equal to a multiple of their base salary as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Chairman     3.0x   
 Vice Chairman     3.0x   
 Chief Executive Officer     3.0x   
 All Other Named Executive Officers     1.5x   
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
        These guidelines represent minimum guidelines; ownership of the Company's stock beyond these levels is encouraged. The required share ownership is re-calculated annually on December 31. Any newly appointed NEO will have three years from the date of appointment to his or her position to comply with these guidelines. Any NEO for whom the guidelines change, whether due to a change in position or otherwise, will have three years from the date of such change to comply with the new guidelines for such NEO. 
        In determining satisfaction of the required ownership guidelines, the calculation includes stock held directly by the executive officer or owned either jointly with, or separately by, his or her immediate family members residing in the same household, shares held in trust for the benefit of the executive officer or his or her immediate family members and all restricted stock with time-based vesting, whether vested or unvested. Stock ownership does not include stock options, stock appreciation rights or the non-vested portion of any performance-based restricted stock. 
        These guidelines may be waived at any time at the discretion of the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee if compliance would create severe hardship or prevent an executive from complying with a court order. It is expected that these instances will be rare. 
        As of December 31, 2018, all of the NEOs satisfied the stock ownership guidelines applicable to them. 
        The Company believes that these guidelines ensure that NEOs hold a sufficient amount of the Company's common stock to further strengthen the long-term link between the results achieved for the Company's stockholders and the compensation provided to the NEOs. Further details of the Company's stock ownership requirements are set forth in the Company's Stock Ownership Guidelines, which can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. 
        Regardless of whether the applicable minimum ownership requirement has been met, each executive officer is prohibited from selling, assigning or otherwise transferring any shares received upon the exercise of any stock option or vesting of a time-based or performance-based restricted stock award for a one-year period beginning on the date the underlying stock option is exercised or the time-based or performance-based restricted stock award vests, in each case net of those shares required to pay the exercise price and any taxes due upon exercise or vesting. 
   Anti-Hedging Policy  
        In 2015, the Board of Directors adopted a policy to prohibit all employees and directors of the Company from purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's securities, including, but not limited to, any prepaid forward contracts, options, puts, calls, equity swaps, collars, other derivative instruments or any other similar type of financial transaction entered into for such purpose. Further details of the Company's anti-hedging policy, as well as other policies that govern participation by the Company's employees and directors in securities transactions, are set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Trading Policy, which can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. 
   Compensation Recoupment Policy  
        In 2015, the Board of Directors, in order to further align management's interests with the interests of stockholders and to support good governance practices, adopted a compensation recoupment policy that allows the Company to recoup, and requires any participant in any incentive-based compensation plan of the Company to repay, all or any portion of any award paid to the employee that may be required to be recouped under federal or state laws, Company policies or listing requirements of any applicable securities exchange. In addition, the policy provides that, in the event of a material restatement of the Company's financial results, the Board of Directors may review the circumstances that caused the restatement and consider issues of accountability for those who bore responsibility for the events leading to such restatement, including whether anyone responsible for such events engaged in misconduct. Depending on the outcome of that review, appropriate action at the discretion of the Board of Directors could include actions such as termination, reducing compensation for the year the restatement was made, seeking repayment of any bonus received for the period restated or any gains realized as a result of exercising an option awarded for the period restated or canceling any equity compensation awarded for the period restated. Further details of the Company's compensation recoupment policy are set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated  Table of Contents
Corporate Governance Guidelines, which can be found on the Company's website at www.selectmedicalholdings.com. 
        The Board of Directors approved amendments to the Company's equity incentive plans, form restricted stock award agreement and executive bonus plan to further clarify that award recipients are subject to compensation recoupment in accordance with the compensation recoupment policy described above. 
   Prohibition of Out of the Money Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right Buy-Outs  
        In 2015, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the Company's equity incentive plans to clarify the Company's existing policy that prohibited the purchase of out of the money stock options or stock appreciation rights for cash or the cancelling of out of the money stock options or stock appreciation rights in exchange for new awards or the lowering of the exercise price of out of the money stock options or stock appreciation rights without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders. 
   Elements of Compensation  
        Executive compensation for any Company fiscal year generally consists of a combination of the following elements, each of which is discussed in further detail in the sections that follow:
        In addition to the compensation components listed above, each of the NEOs is party to either an employment agreement or a change in control agreement with Select that provides for post-employment severance payments and benefits in the event of employment termination under certain circumstances. 
        In determining the different elements of compensation to provide to the NEOs in any given year, the Compensation Committee does not adhere to a specific allocation between short-term and long-term compensation, or between cash and non-cash compensation. Instead, the Compensation Committee determines the elements of NEO compensation for any given year in a manner designed to further its goals of rewarding strong financial performance, providing overall compensation opportunities that are sufficient to attract and retain highly skilled NEOs and ensuring that our NEOs' interests are aligned with those of our stockholders. This may result in the NEOs receiving all cash compensation in some years (through base salary and annual performance-based bonuses) and a combination of cash and equity compensation in other years (through base salary, annual performance-based bonuses and long-term equity awards). 
   Base Salary  
        Base salaries are provided to the NEOs to compensate them for services rendered during the year. Consistent with the Company's philosophy of placing increasing emphasis on performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee sets the base salaries for the NEOs at levels which it believes are competitive for the healthcare industry when combined with the Company's incentive programs. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews base salaries for the NEOs. There was no change in the annual base salaries for Messrs. Jackson, Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. Mr. Chernow's annual base salary increased from $983,904 to $995,000, effective April 1, 2017, and Mr. Tarvin's annual base salary increased from $500,000 to $520,000, effective January 1, 2018. Mr. Chernow received this base salary increase to reflect his strong performance and to bring his annual base salary more in line with that of our Executive Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Mr. Tarvin received this base salary increase to reflect his strong performance and to align his annual base salary with what the Compensation Committee believed to be market for executive officers with similar skills and experience.

   2018 Named Executive Officer Annual Performance-Based Bonuses  
        Annual bonuses are included as part of the executive compensation program because the Compensation Committee believes that a significant portion of each NEO's compensation should be contingent on the Company's financial performance. Accordingly, the Company has historically maintained a bonus plan under which NEOs are eligible to receive annual bonuses based upon the achievement of specific pre-determined performance measures. 
        For the 2018 fiscal year, each of the NEOs participated in the Select Medical Holdings Corporation Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan (the "Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan"), which was last approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2013 Annual Meeting. Historically, the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan was implemented to provide the Compensation Committee with the discretion to grant bonus compensation to the Company's NEOs that can qualify as "performance-based compensation" and thereby be exempt from the $1 million cap on deductibility under Section 162(m) ("Section 162(m)") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Under the tax reform legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Reform Law"), which eliminated this performance-based compensation exemption, bonuses paid under the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan will be subject to the cap on deductibility described above unless they qualify for transition relief for certain pre-existing compensation arrangements. However, even if all or a portion of the bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year under the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan qualify for such transition relief, the Compensation Committee retains the sole discretion to administer its annual bonus program in a manner that is not consistent with such transition relief and therefore does not allow bonuses to so qualify if it determines that doing so is appropriate. The Compensation Committee also retains discretion to grant bonus compensation to the NEOs and other employees of the Company outside of the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan. 
        Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan, eligible employees, including the NEOs, may earn bonus compensation based on the achievement of pre-determined performance goals, such as earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets, sales, stock price and operating income. In connection with establishing the performance goals for each performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the amount of bonus compensation that may be paid to participants upon the achievement of the relevant performance goals. In addition, the Compensation Committee may decrease each participant's bonus award under the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan in its sole discretion. In the event that a participant earns a bonus under the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan, such bonus will be paid either in cash or in shares of restricted stock under the Company's equity compensation plans. The Compensation Committee may consider amending or terminating the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan in the future in light of the effects of the Tax Reform Law on the deductibility of bonus compensation. 
        Consistent with prior years, NEO bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year were based on the Company's achievement of specified levels of earnings per share and return on equity. The Compensation Committee selected adjusted earnings per share and adjusted return on equity as the performance measures for 2018 bonuses because the Compensation Committee believes that each of these metrics is directly related to the creation of stockholder value. For 2018, the Compensation Committee established target and maximum adjusted earnings per share levels of $1.0280 and $1.1308, respectively, and established target and maximum adjusted return on equity levels of 15.80% and 16.59%, respectively.  Table of Contents
        In March 2018, the Compensation Committee established a performance matrix to calculate NEO bonuses for the 2018 fiscal year. The 2018 performance matrix used to calculate 2018 NEO bonuses is set forth below:

        Pursuant to this performance matrix, if both threshold adjusted earnings per share ($0.9972) and threshold adjusted return on equity (15.48%) were not achieved, then no NEO would receive a bonus for the 2018 fiscal year. If, however, the threshold level of performance was achieved for both adjusted earnings per share and adjusted return on equity, then the NEOs would receive a bonus equal to the percentage of their target bonus that corresponds with the Company's actual adjusted earnings per share and adjusted return on equity, as set forth on the performance matrix. For example, if adjusted earnings per share was $1.0486 and adjusted return on equity was 15.80%, then each NEO would receive a bonus equal to 120% of his target bonus. 
        For 2018, the target and maximum bonus opportunities for each of the NEOs is set forth in the table below (expressed as a percentage of the NEOs' rate of base salary in effect on December 31, 2018).

[END TABLE]
        In determining the level of the Company's performance for purposes of awarding the 2018 bonuses to the NEOs, the Compensation Committee, as required by the terms of the Amended and Restated Executive Bonus Plan, calculated the Company's return on equity and earnings per share. Accordingly, for 2018, after adjusting to exclude certain costs related to the acquisition of U.S. HealthWorks, Inc. and the losses related to early extinguishment of debt, the Company achieved adjusted earnings per share of $1.082 and the Company's adjusted return on equity was 17.98%. This resulted in 2018 bonuses equaling 200% of target for each NEO. Based on such performance, Messrs. Chernow, Robert A. Ortenzio, Rocco A. Ortenzio, Jackson and Tarvin earned bonuses of $1,990,000, $1,990,000, $1,520,000, $1,120,000 and $832,000, respectively, as set forth in the "non-equity incentive plan compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.

   Equity Compensation  
         2018 Annual Awards.    At the 2016 Annual Meeting, the Company's stockholders approved the Select Medical Holdings Corporation 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the "2016 Equity Plan"), which the Company currently maintains. The 2016 Equity Plan was established to provide certain employees, consultants and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the NEOs) with incentives to help align those individuals' interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders. Awards under the 2016 Equity Plan may be in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, performance stock units and other stock-based rights. In January 2019, the 2016 Equity Plan was amended to limit the rate of vesting of options and stock appreciation rights granted pursuant to the 2016 Equity Plan to be no greater than 25% per year, with the first vesting date being no earlier than one year after the grant date (subject to certain accelerated vesting permitted under the 2016 Equity Plan in connection with a change in control of the Company). 
        The Company previously maintained the Select Medical Holdings Corporation 2011 Equity Incentive Plan ("2011 Equity Plan"). Following the approval of the 2016 Equity Plan, the Company terminated the 2011 Equity Plan with respect to the grant of new awards. 
        On July 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded each NEO restricted shares of common stock under the 2016 Equity Plan. The number of restricted shares awarded to each NEO is set forth in the table below. Such shares will vest in full on July 31, 2021, subject to the NEO's continued employment on such date. For all NEOs except Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio, pro-rata vesting is provided in the event that a NEO's employment is terminated prior to July 31, 2021 due to death, disability or following a change in control. Information relating to the vesting of awards granted to Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio is contained below under the heading "Awards to Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 David S. Chernow     250,000   
 Robert A. Ortenzio     250,000   
 Rocco A. Ortenzio     150,000   
 Martin F. Jackson     150,000   
 Michael E. Tarvin     100,000   
[END TABLE]
        In making such restricted stock grants, the Compensation Committee believed that the annual long-term equity award opportunities for Messrs. Chernow, Robert A. Ortenzio, Rocco A. Ortenzio, Jackson and Tarvin were in line with the annual long-term equity award opportunities for their counterparts at comparable companies. Based on the foregoing, the Compensation Committee concluded that restricted stock awards for such NEOs were appropriate to ensure that they are adequately incentivized and that their long-term interests are properly aligned with those of our stockholders. 
        Awards to Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio.    The current terms of each of Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio's restricted stock grants, including the grants on August 3, 2016, August 2, 2017 and July 31, 2018, provide for full vesting upon the occurrence of a change of control, in the event that his employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than for cause or in the event of his death or disability. These terms are in consideration of Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio's long term service to the Company as its Co-Founder. 
   Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits  
        The Company provides NEOs with perquisites and other personal benefits that it and the Compensation Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with the Company's overall compensation program to better enable the Company to attract and retain highly skilled NEOs. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to NEOs. 
         Use of Company Aircraft.    The primary perquisite and personal benefit the NEOs are currently provided is the personal use of the Company's aircraft at the Company's expense. In recognition of their contributions to the Company in 2018, Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio were entitled to use the  Table of Contents
Company's aircraft for personal reasons and could be accompanied by friends and family members. Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio must recognize taxable compensation for the value of the personal use of the Company's aircraft by themselves and their friends and family members. In 2018, Messrs. Chernow, Jackson and Tarvin could use the Company's aircraft in connection with a personal emergency or bereavement matter with the prior approval of Mr. Robert A. Ortenzio or Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio. Additionally, in 2018, Mr. Chernow could use the Company's aircraft for travel between his personal residence and the Company's headquarters. Mr. Chernow may be accompanied by his family members for such travel, as well as when using the Company's aircraft for business trips. Mr. Chernow must recognize taxable compensation for the value of the personal use of the Company's aircraft by himself and, when applicable, his family members. In addition, Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio have discretion to determine when other executives may use the aircraft for personal trips, provided that such executives recognize taxable compensation for the value of the personal use of the Company's aircraft when so approved. 
        Physical Examination.    The Company offers full reimbursement for the costs associated with an annual comprehensive physical exam for the NEOs, including travel and accommodations, so that a NEO who makes use of the Company's physical exam benefit can be evaluated and receive diagnostic and preventive medical care. 
         Taxes.    As described below under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control," each NEO is entitled to a tax gross-up payment in the event that any change in control payments which they are entitled to receive constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The Company believes that this benefit is appropriate to ensure that, in the event of a potential change in control, the NEOs are focused on closing the change in control transaction and maximizing stockholder value. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy that prohibits the Company from including excise tax gross-up payments in connection with a change of control in future agreements that do not already contain such excise tax gross-up payments. 
        Attributed costs of the perquisites and personal benefits described above for the NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are included in the "Summary Compensation Table," below. 
   General Benefits  
        The NEOs are also eligible to participate in the Company's broad-based employee benefit plans, including group health and dental plans, short term and long term disability plans, life insurance plan (at an amount equal to 100% of base salary) and the Company's 401(k) plan on the same terms and conditions as those plans are available to the Company's employees generally. 
   Employment Agreements  
        It is the Company's general philosophy that all of the Company's employees should be "at will" employees, thereby allowing both the Company and the employee to terminate the employment relationship at any time and without restriction or financial obligation. However, in certain cases, the Company has determined that, as a retention device and a means to obtain non-compete arrangements, employment agreements and change in control agreements are appropriate. 
        Mr. Chernow entered into an employment agreement with Select on September 13, 2010. Mr. Chernow's employment agreement provides for a three-year term which is automatically extended for successive one-year periods beginning on the third anniversary of the effective date of the employment agreement. Either Select or Mr. Chernow may elect to not extend the term of the employment agreement by providing advance written notice of non-renewal to the other party. Mr. Chernow's employment agreement also prohibits him from, during employment and for the two-year period thereafter, (i) participating in any business that competes with Select or any of its affiliates within a 50 mile radius of any of Select's or its affiliates' facilities or the facilities of any customer in which or to whom Mr. Chernow provided services during the twelve-month period prior to his termination, and (ii) soliciting any of Select's or its affiliates' employees, clients or customers.

        Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio each entered into an employment agreement with Select on March 1, 2000. Each of these employment agreements provides for a three-year term which is automatically extended for an additional year on each anniversary of the effective date of the employment agreement, thereby causing the agreements to have a three-year term as of each anniversary of the effective date. Either Select or the executive may elect to not extend the term of the employment agreement by providing advance written notice of non-renewal to the other party. These employment agreements also prohibit the executives from (i) participating in any business that competes with Select or any of its affiliates within a 25 mile radius of any of Select's or its affiliates' hospitals or outpatient rehabilitation clinics during employment and for two years thereafter, and (ii) soliciting any of Select's employees for one year after the termination of his employment. 
        The employment agreements for Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio, Rocco A. Ortenzio and Chernow also provide for certain severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment, as described below under the section titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
        Messrs. Jackson and Tarvin are employees at-will, and accordingly, elements of their annual compensation are subject to review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee. However, Messrs. Jackson and Tarvin are party to change in control agreements with Select that provide for severance upon their termination of employment in connection with a change in control, as described below in the section titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
        The terms of each of these agreements, including the severance benefits that may be payable under these agreements, are described below more fully in the section titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
   Tax and Accounting Considerations  
        The Company considers tax and accounting implications in determining all elements of its compensation programs. Section 162(m) of the Code generally denies a deduction to any publicly held corporation for compensation (other than qualified performance-based compensation) exceeding $1,000,000 paid in a taxable year to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, or any one of the next three most highly compensated officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer) serving in such capacity at any time during the taxable year, or any other individual who was a "covered employee" (within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code then in effect) for any taxble year beginning after December 31, 2016 reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. The Compensation Committee considers the impact of this cap on deductibility on the compensation that it intends to award, and may structure compensation such that it is not deductible if it determines that doing so is appropriate and consistent with the Company's executive compensation program. When establishing executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the effect of various forms of compensation on the Company's financial results. In particular, the Compensation Committee considers the potential impact, on current and future financial results, of all equity compensation that it approves.  Table of Contents

   Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control  
        Each of our NEOs may be entitled to certain payments upon termination of employment or a change in control, as described below. 
   Termination of Employment Not in Connection with a Change in Control  
        Pursuant to the employment agreements between Select and Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio, upon a termination of employment by Select without cause (other than due to death or disability) or by the executive officer for good reason, and except with respect to certain terminations in connection with a change in control (as described below), each such NEO is entitled to receive (i) immediate vesting of any unvested stock options outstanding prior to such termination of employment, (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (based on actual performance if performance goals have been established for such year) and (iii) an amount equal to the base salary he would have received over the remainder of the employment term had no such termination occurred, with such amount to be paid in installments for the remainder of the term of the executive's employment agreement, beginning on the six-month anniversary of such termination of employment. As a condition to receiving such payments, each such executive must execute a release of claims. 
        Pursuant to the employment agreement between Select and Mr. Chernow, upon his termination by Select without cause (other than by reason of death or disability or in connection with a change in control), Mr. Chernow is entitled to receive twelve months of continued base salary, with such payments to begin on the Company's first payroll date of the seventh month following the date of such termination (provided that such first payment will include an amount equal to Mr. Chernow's base salary for the period from the date of such termination to the first regular payroll date of the seventh month following such termination). As a condition to receiving such payments, Mr. Chernow must execute a release of claims. 
        The employment agreements also entitle Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio and Rocco A. Ortenzio to receive salary continuation through insurance in the event of a termination of employment by reason of disability. Such salary continuation is at the rate of 100% of base salary for Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio and 50% of base salary for Mr. Robert A. Ortenzio. In addition, such salary continuation is payable for a period of up to ten years, subject to earlier termination if the executive becomes physically able to resume employment in an occupation consistent with his education, training and experience. 
        Pursuant to the restricted stock awards granted to Messrs. Chernow, Robert A. Ortenzio, Jackson and Tarvin on each of July 31, 2018, August 2, 2017 and August 3, 2016, a pro-rata portion of the awards will vest in the event of a termination of employment prior to the vesting date of the award as a result of death or disability. Each of the restricted stock awards granted to Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio will become fully vested in the event that his employment is terminated due to death or disability or by the Company without cause. 
        For purposes of the employment agreements, "cause" is generally defined as (i) the willful and continued failure of the executive to substantially perform his duties, (ii) the engaging by the executive in willful or reckless misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to Select, or (iii) the conviction of the executive of a felony involving moral turpitude. In addition, "good reason" is generally defined as (i) the assignment to the executive of any duties inconsistent in any material respect with his position, authority, duties or responsibilities, or any other action by Select which results in a material diminution or material adverse change in such position, status, authority, duties or responsibilities, (ii) any failure by Select to comply with its duties to provide the executive with compensation and benefits, (iii) a requirement that the executive be based at any office or location other than Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania or within 25 miles of such location or (iv) any failure by Select to cause its successor to assume its obligations under the employment agreement.  Table of Contents
        Set forth in the table below are the amounts that would be payable to each of the NEOs upon termination of employment without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, and not in connection with a change in control, assuming that such termination occurred on December 31, 2018.

   Change in Control  
        Mr. Chernow's employment agreement provides for change in control severance benefits if (i) within the one-year period immediately following a change in control, (1) Mr. Chernow's employment is terminated by Select without cause and other than for death or disability, (2) Mr. Chernow terminates his employment with Select for good reason, (3) Mr. Chernow terminates his employment because Select reduces Mr. Chernow's compensation from that in effect immediately prior to the change in control, or (4) Mr. Chernow terminates his employment because Select requires Mr. Chernow to relocate his principal place of employment to a location anywhere other than Select's principal executive offices in (or within 25 miles of) Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, or (ii) within the six-month period immediately preceding a change in control, Mr. Chernow's employment is terminated by Select other than for cause, death or disability and he reasonably demonstrates that his termination was at the request of a third party who took steps to effect the change in control. In the event of a termination of employment described in clause (i), Mr. Chernow is entitled to receive (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to his base salary plus bonus for the previous three completed calendar years and (2) immediate vesting of all unvested stock options that were outstanding prior to such termination. In the event of a termination described in clause (ii), Mr. Chernow is entitled to receive an amount equal to his base salary plus bonus for the previous three completed calendar years, with such amount to be paid in equal installments on each of the Company's regular payroll dates over the twelve (12) month period following such termination; provided that the commencement of such payments shall be delayed until the first payroll date of the seventh month following such termination; provided further that the first payment made shall include the payments that otherwise would be made had the delay described in the preceding clause not been imposed. 
        Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio's and Rocco A. Ortenzio's employment agreements provide for change in control severance benefits if (i) within the one-year period immediately following a change in control, such  Table of Contents executive's employment is terminated by Select without cause or such executive terminates his employment for any reason, or (ii) within the six-month period immediately preceding a change in control, such executive's employment is terminated without cause and the terminated executive reasonably demonstrates that his termination was at the request of a third party who took steps to effect the change in control. In the event of such a termination of employment, such executives are entitled to receive (i) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination (based on actual performance if performance goals have been established for such year), (ii) an amount equal to his base salary and bonus for the previous three completed calendar years, with such amount to be paid in installments for the remainder of the term of such executive's employment agreement (provided that the first payment shall be made on the first regular payroll date of the seventh month following such termination and shall include the installments that would have otherwise been made during such period), and (iii) immediate vesting of all unvested stock options that were outstanding prior to such termination (with such vesting to occur immediately prior to such change in control). 
        Select has entered into change in control agreements with Messrs. Jackson and Tarvin. These agreements provide that if (i) within a five-year period immediately following a change in control, (A) Select terminates the executive without cause, the executive terminates his employment because Select reduced his compensation from that in effect prior to the change in control or (B) Select relocates the executive's principal place of employment to a location more than 25 miles from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, (ii) within the six-month period immediately following the change in control, the executive terminates his employment for good reason or (iii) within the six-month period immediately preceding the change in control, Select terminates the executive's employment without cause and he reasonably demonstrates that his termination by Select was at the request of a third party who took steps to effect the change in control, then Select is obligated to pay the executive, on the first day of the seventh month following such termination, a lump-sum cash payment equal to his base salary plus bonus for the previous three completed calendar years. In addition, in the event of such a termination, all of the executive's stock options will become fully vested upon the later of such termination or change in control. 
        Each of the restricted stock awards granted to Messrs. Chernow, Robert A. Ortenzio, Jackson and Tarvin on July 31, 2018, August 2, 2017 and August 3, 2016 provide that a pro-rata portion of the restricted stock will vest in the event that any such NEO's employment is terminated following a change in control (as defined in the 2016 Equity Plan). All restricted stock awards granted to Mr. Rocco A. Ortenzio will become fully vested upon a change in control. 
        In addition to the benefits described above, each NEO is entitled to receive a tax gross-up payment in the event that any change in control payments which he is entitled to receive constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. The tax gross-up payment will equal the amount necessary to place the NEO in the same position as if no penalty under Section 4999 of the Code had been imposed on any of the change in control payments, including on the tax gross-up payment. As described above under the heading "Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits," while these agreements will remain in effect, in 2015, the Board of Directors adopted a policy that prohibits the Company from including excise tax gross-up payments in connection with a change of control in future agreements that do not already contain such excise tax gross-up payments. 
        For purposes of Mr. Chernow's employment agreement, a "change in control" is generally defined to include: (i) the acquisition by a person or group, other than certain controlling stockholders, of more than 50% of the voting shares of the Company or Select; (ii) during any twelve-month period, there is a change in the majority of the Board of Directors of the Company; (iii) a business combination of the Company or Select in which the stockholders of the corporation involved in the business combination cease to own shares representing more than 50% of the voting power of the surviving corporation; or (iv) during any twelve-month period, a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company or Select, other than to an entity controlled by the stockholders of the selling corporation prior to the sale. 
        For purposes of the employment or change in control agreements with Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio, Rocco A. Ortenzio, Jackson, and Tarvin, a "change in control" is generally defined to include: (i) the acquisition by a person or group, other than certain controlling stockholders, of more than 50% of the voting shares of the Company or Select; (ii) during any twelve-month period, the acquisition of at least 33% of the voting shares of the Company or Select; (iii) during any twelve-month period, there is a change in the majority of the Board of Directors of the Company or Select; (iv) a business combination of the Company or  Table of Contents
Select in which the stockholders of the corporation involved in the business combination cease to own shares representing more than 50% of the voting power of the surviving corporation; or (v) during any twelve-month period, a sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company or Select, other than to an entity controlled by the stockholders of the selling corporation prior to the sale. 
        For purposes of Messrs. Jackson's and Tarvin's change in control agreements, "cause" generally has the same meaning as set forth in the employment agreements for Messrs. Robert A. Ortenzio, Rocco A. Ortenzio and Chernow, as described above in this section. In addition, generally, each of Messrs. Jackson and Tarvin will have "good reason" to terminate their employment if (i) the executive makes a good faith determination that, as a result of a change in control, he is unable to perform his services effectively or there is any significant adverse change in his authority or responsibilities, as performed immediately prior to such change in control or (ii) Select's obligations under the change in control agreement are not assumed by the acquiring entity or any of its affiliates. 
        Set forth in the table below are the amounts that would be payable to each of the NEOs upon the occurrence of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control, as described above in this section. In addition, the table below sets forth the amounts that would be payable to each of the NEOs upon the occurrence of a change in control. The amounts reported in the table below were calculated assuming that the relevant events occurred on December 31, 2018.

   Pay Ratio  
        The Company analyzed the total annual compensation for all of its employees and the employees of its consolidated subsidiaries, other than our Chief Executive Officer, in order to identify the employee with the median total annual compensation. In making this determination, the Company examined only payroll records of individuals who were employed by the Company or one of its consolidated subsidiaries on December 31, 2018. No cost of living adjustments were made to any such employee's compensation, but the Company did annualize the compensation of individuals who commenced employment after January 1, 2018. After the median compensated employee was identified, that employee's total annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 was determined in the same manner as if such individual was a named executive officer for 2018 whose compensation was required to be determined in accordance with SEC rules and reported in our "Summary Compensation Table" on page 19. Based on the foregoing, the total annual compensation of such employee, as determined in accordance with SEC rules, was $41,454.84. As provided in our Summary Compensation Table, the total annual compensation for our Chief Executive Officer for the 2018 fiscal year was $8,201,031, which was 197.8 times the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee for the 2018 fiscal year. 
        The above figures were reported in accordance with SEC rules. However, the Company believes that a more accurate disclosure would exclude "on-call" employees who have no set work schedule and work only on an as-needed basis, which may be a few times a year. If these "on-call" employees were excluded from the determination of our median compensated employee for the 2018 fiscal year, the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee would be $53,528.94, resulting in a ratio of the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to such employee of 153.2:1. 
        Because a significant amount of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation for 2018 was in the form of equity compensation, and only a very small number of our employees receive equity compensation, we thought it would be helpful to our stockholders to see how the above ratios are impacted by excluding equity compensation. Excluding equity compensation, the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee remains unchanged and the total annual compensation for our Chief Executive Officer would be $3,001,031, resulting in a ratio of 72.4:1 if "on-call" employees are included and a ratio of 56.1:1 if "on-call" employees are not included.

    SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS         
        The SEC's rules set forth standards as to what stockholder proposals are required to be included in a proxy statement. Any proposal of a stockholder intended to be included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy/voting instruction card for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must comply with the proxy submission rules of the SEC. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the SEC's rules, any such stockholder proposal intended to be included in the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement must be received by the Company's Secretary at the address listed below no later than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the release of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, unless the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, in which case the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send proxy materials. In order to be included in the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8, any stockholder proposal must be received by the Secretary at the address listed below by November 7, 2019, which is 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the release of the 2019 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement. 
        In addition, the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws require that the Company be given advanced notice of stockholder proposals containing nominations for election to the Board of Directors or other matters which stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting. These requirements are separate from, and in addition to, the requirements discussed above to have the stockholder proposal included in the proxy statement and form of proxy/voting instruction card pursuant to the SEC's rules.

The Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws set forth certain informational requirements for stockholders' nominations of directors and other proposals. 
        For any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in the 2020 Proxy Statement but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, SEC rules permit management to vote proxies in its discretion if (a) in certain cases, the Company received notice of the proposal before the close of business 45 days before the first anniversary of the mailing date of this Proxy Statement and advises stockholders in the 2020 Proxy Statement about the nature of the matter and how management intends to vote on such matter, or (b) the Company did not receive notice of the proposal prior to the close of business 45 days before the first anniversary of the mailing date of this Proxy Statement. 
        Stockholders must send such proposals to: Michael E. Tarvin, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Select Medical Holdings Corporation, 4714 Gettysburg Road, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania 17055.  Table of Contents

    NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON THE   COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS   PROPOSAL #2         
        As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of its NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion beginning with the section titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" of this Proxy Statement. At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2018, a substantial majority of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes that this affirms our stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation. 
        The Company's goal for its executive compensation program is to reward the NEOs' contributions to the Company's financial performance and provide overall compensation sufficient to attract and retain highly skilled NEOs who are properly motivated to contribute to the Company's financial performance. The Company believes that it achieves these goals by (i) offering competitive base salaries to the NEOs, (ii) offering the NEOs participation in an annual incentive plan that provides for payouts only in the event that pre-determined financial targets are achieved, (iii) tying a substantial portion of each NEO's annual compensation directly to the Company's performance, and (iv) granting equity-based awards with a multi-year vesting schedule (and subject to stock ownership guidelines). 
        For a detailed description of the Company's financial results for fiscal year 2018, please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Company believes that its executive compensation program has played an essential role in its continuing financial success by aligning the long-term interests of its NEOs with the long-term interests of its stockholders. 
        The Board of Directors encourages the Company's stockholders to approve the following resolution (the "Executive Compensation Resolution"): 
        "RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
        As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering the Company's executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal, and therefore will take such vote into consideration when evaluating the Company's compensation programs and practices applicable to the NEOs. 
        The Board of Directors recommends voting "FOR" the approval of the Executive Compensation Resolution. Table of Contents
    RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC   ACCOUNTING FIRM   PROPOSAL #3

Although action by the stockholders on this matter is not required, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors believe it is appropriate to seek stockholder ratification of this selection in light of the role played by the independent registered public accounting firm in reporting on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Ratification requires the affirmative vote of a majority of eligible shares present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. If this appointment is not ratified by the stockholders, the Audit and Compliance Committee may reconsider its selection. 
        One or more representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

    AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT         
        The following report of the Audit and Compliance Committee will not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Exchange Act (together, the "Acts"), except to the extent that we specifically incorporate this information by reference. The following report shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
        The Audit and Compliance Committee assists the Company's Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit and Compliance Committee operates pursuant to a charter. As set forth in the charter, management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and for reviewing the Company's unaudited interim financial statements. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of the charter on an annual basis. It is not the Audit and Compliance Committee's duty or responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. The Audit and Compliance Committee will however take the appropriate actions to set the overall corporate "tone" for quality financial reporting, sound business risk practices, and ethical behavior. 
        The Audit and Compliance Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to the selection and compensation of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the scope of the Company's annual audits, and the fees to be paid to the independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee monitors the performance and independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and approves all services provided to the Company by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Compliance Committee consults with and reviews recommendations made by the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to financial statements, financial records and financial controls of the Company. The Audit and Compliance Committee meets with management periodically to consider the adequacy of the Company's internal controls and discusses with management the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. 
        The Board of Directors, in its business judgment, has determined that each of the directors on the Audit and Compliance Committee is independent as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit and Compliance Committee qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC, and has financial sophistication in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
        In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2018 with management of the Company and with the independent registered public accounting firm, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles, as well as an opinion on management's assessment of, and the effective operation of, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114, SEC Rule 2-07 and such other matters as are required to be discussed under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit and Compliance Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit and Compliance Committee concerning independence. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence, including the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.  Table of Contents
        The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for its 2018 audit and met with them both with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examination, its evaluation of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
        Based upon the review, reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit and Compliance Committee referred to above and in the charter, the Audit and Compliance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC. 
        The Audit and Compliance Committee has selected the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit and report upon the Company's financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for fiscal year 2019. In making this selection, the Audit and Compliance Committee has considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's provision of services other than audit services is compatible with maintaining independence.
