2018 Governance Highlights
In 2018, the company continued to follow its strong governance policies and practices to benefit shareholders. Highlights included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy Access - The board is committed to strong governance. It keeps abreast of developing governance practices and adopts those that it believes are appropriate for our company and its shareholders. In 2018, shareholders approved an amendment to the company's Code of Regulations to allow proxy access for director nominations.  
• Majority Voting - A majority voting standard applies to uncontested elections of directors. The board believes that this voting standard gives shareholders a more meaningful voice in electing our directors and reinforces our commitment to accountability and strong corporate governance practices.  
• Cybersecurity - Cybersecurity is a growing threat for all companies. For the fourth year in a row, the audit committee increased its understanding of the company's cybersecurity risk through reports of testing by third-party experts of the company's cybersecurity program structure and capabilities.  
• Board Refreshment and Composition - Informed by feedback from its annual board self-evaluation, engagement with investors each year and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board continuously assesses the composition of the board of directors. Its goal is to balance independence, board size, tenure, and diversity of experience, skills, competencies and other qualities of current directors and future director candidates to best structure and govern itself in the short- and long-term and provide effective oversight of management for the benefit of shareholders.  
• Succession Planning - Succession planning at all levels is important to the long-term success of the company. In 2018, the board continued its practice of attending meetings of the subsidiary boards during which more than a dozen executives provide reports. These meetings provide the directors with opportunities to become familiar with this level of management, assess their development over time and gain in-depth knowledge about the company's operating businesses. Additionally, each year the board discusses potential management succession candidates with the chief executive officer at one of its regular meetings.

2018 Business and Financial Highlights
In 2018, our industry experienced a second consecutive year of elevated levels of insured losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophic weather events. It also was a year that ended with a sharp decline in the equity markets. Your company delivered strong operating results and somewhat mixed financial performance that benefited shareholders with one-year and three-year total shareholder returns of 6.2 percent and 43.0 percent, respectively; a 4.4 percent decrease in book value; and a 6.0 percent increase in regular cash dividends declared. This performance generated payouts of annual incentive compensation and performance-based restricted stock units at threshold levels for our named executive officers. Highlights of our company's performance in 2018 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A 45 percent increase in underwriting profit to $186 million and a combined ratio of 96.4 percent for 2018, marking our seventh consecutive year of underwriting profit. In 2018, our efforts to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities with better pricing precision and risk-selection decisions continued to benefit underwriting performance.  
• An all-time record-level of consolidated property casualty new business written premiums at $652 million, up 4 percent, driven by new agency appointment contributions. 
• A 4 percent increase in consolidated property casualty net written premiums to more than $5 billion in 2018. The increase in premiums reflects our growth initiatives, modest average price increases for most lines of business and a higher level of insured exposures.  
• A $4 million improvement in life insurance subsidiary net income, largely due to decreased income taxes as a result of tax reform, after factoring out the 2017 $111 million benefit from revaluation of deferred income taxes due to tax reform. 
• $17.516 billion in consolidated cash and invested assets, down 1 percent over the prior year. 
• A 2 percent increase in pretax investment income to a record $619 million, net of expenses, reflecting a 6 percent increase in equity portfolio dividends and flat interest income. 
• A value creation ratio (VCR) of negative 0.1 percent for 2018, exceeding that measure for three of the nine companies in our peer group. Our average annual VCR for the five-year period ending December 31, 2018, is 10.7 percent, within our announced goal of producing an annual average VCR of 10 percent to 13 percent in any five-year period. 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, our results allowed the board to continue to reward shareholders with an increase of our regular annual cash dividend for the 58th consecutive year. Through the cash dividends paid and share repurchases, we returned $461 million to shareholders in 2018, and $1.298 billion during the three years ending December 31, 2018.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
The named executive officers earned payouts of annual incentive compensation at the threshold level and performance based restricted stock units at the threshold level for the performance period ending December 31, 2018, which included a VCR of -0.1 percent, exceeding three peer companies; and a three-year total shareholder return of 43.0 percent, outperforming four peer companies. Set forth below is the 2018 compensation for each named executive officer as determined under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules.

Section 16(A) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Directors, executive officers and 10 percent shareholders are required to report their beneficial ownership of our stock according to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Those individuals are required by SEC regulations to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
SEC regulations require us to identify in this proxy statement anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent calendar year. Based on our review of forms we received or written representations from reporting persons stating that they were not required to file these forms, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were satisfied on a timely basis during calendar year 2018.
Information About the Board of Directors
The mission of the board is to encourage, facilitate and foster the long-term success of Cincinnati Financial Corporation. The board oversees management in the performance of the company's obligations to our independent agents, policyholders, associates, communities and suppliers in a manner consistent with the company's mission and with the board's responsibility to shareholders to achieve the highest sustainable shareholder value over the long term.
Page 11
Proposal 1 - Election of Directors 
Directors are elected annually. The board of directors currently consists of 14 directors, 10 of whom are  determined to be independent by the board, according to the definition of independence specified in the Nasdaq listing requirements. On November 16, 2018, the board, upon the recommendation of its nominating committee, unanimously nominated the 14 directors listed below for re-election to the board at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
The directors elected at the Annual Meeting will hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Unless otherwise instructed, the persons named in the proxy card (the proxy holders) attached to this proxy statement, as filed with the SEC, intend to vote the proxies held by them for the election of the 14 nominees named below. The board of directors knows of no reason why these nominees should be unable or unwilling to serve, but if that should be the case, proxies received will be voted for the election of such other persons, if any, as the board of directors may designate.
Vote Required
Director nominees receiving more votes cast for their election than against will be elected directors of the company. Abstentions and broker nonvotes have no effect on the voting for this proposal.
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR William F. Bahl, Gregory T. Bier, Linda W. Clement-Holmes, Dirk J. Debbink, Steven J. Johnston, Kenneth C. Lichtendahl, W. Rodney McMullen, David P. Osborn, Gretchen W. Price, Thomas R. Schiff, Douglas S. Skidmore, Kenneth W. Stecher, John F. Steele, Jr. and Larry R. Webb as directors to hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are elected and seated.
Directors of Your Company
Each of our directors brings to our board extensive management and leadership experience gained through their service as executives and, in several cases, chief executive officers of diverse businesses. In these executive roles, they have taken hands-on, day-to-day responsibility for strategy and operations, including management of capital, risk and business cycles. In addition, most current directors bring public company board experience – either significant experience on other boards or long service on our board – that broadens their knowledge of board policies and processes, rules and regulations, and issues and solutions. Further, each director has civic and community involvement that mirrors our company's values emphasizing personal service, relationships and local decision making. The nominating committee's process to recommend qualified director candidates is described on Page 27 under Director Nomination Considerations and Process.
The biographies of our current directors, including their names, ages, the year first elected as a director, their present positions, principal occupations and public company directorships held in the past five or more years begin on Page 13. For each director, we also describe specific individual qualifications and skills that contribute to the overall effectiveness of our board and its committees.

Governance of Your Company
2018 Governance Highlights
In 2018, the company continued to follow its strong governance policies and practices to benefit shareholders. Highlights included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy Access - The board is committed to strong governance. It keeps abreast of developing governance practices and adopts those that it believes are appropriate for our company and its shareholders. In 2018, shareholders approved an amendment to the company's Code of Regulations to allow proxy access for director nominations.  
• Majority Voting - A majority voting standard applies to uncontested elections of directors. The board believes that this voting standard gives shareholders a more meaningful voice in electing our directors and reinforces our commitment to accountability and strong corporate governance practices.  
• Cybersecurity - Cybersecurity is a growing threat for all companies. For the fourth year in a row, the audit committee increased its understanding of the company's cybersecurity risk through reports of testing by third-party experts of the company's cybersecurity program structure and capabilities.  
• Board Refreshment and Composition - Informed by feedback from its annual board self-evaluation, engagement with investors each year and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board continuously assesses the composition of the board of directors. Its goal is to balance independence, board size, tenure, and diversity of experience, skills, competencies and other qualities of current directors and future director candidates to best structure and govern itself in the short- and long-term and provide effective oversight of management for the benefit of shareholders.  
• Succession Planning - Succession planning at all levels is important to the long-term success of the company. In 2018, the board continued its practice of attending meetings of the subsidiary boards during which more than a dozen executives provide reports. These meetings provide the directors with opportunities to become familiar with this level of management, assess their development over time and gain in-depth knowledge about the company's operating businesses. Additionally, each year the board discusses potential management succession candidates with the chief executive officer at one of its regular meetings. 
[END TABLE]
Page 24
Governance Policies and Practices
Our primary governance policies and practices are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Code of Conduct applicable to all associates of the company. The nominating committee reviews these documents annually and, when appropriate, recommends changes for the board's consideration and approval. These guidelines and codes are available on cinfin.com/investors.
Certain of the board's governance policies and practices are summarized below:
Code of Conduct - Our Code of Conduct applies to the company and its U.S. subsidiaries and all of their associates, including officers and directors. It establishes ethical standards for a variety of topics, including complying with laws and regulations, observing blackout periods for trading in the company's securities, accepting and giving gifts, handling conflicts of interest, handling the company's confidential information and personal data of consumers, and reporting illegal or unethical behavior. 
Governance Hotline - Our audit committee oversees a governance hotline for the reporting of concerns about the company's auditing, accounting and financial reporting activities. Callers can remain anonymous or identify themselves. The hotline is maintained by a third-party vendor. Reports of all calls are reported to the audit committee.
Board Leadership and Executive Sessions - The chairman of the board presides at all meetings of the board of directors. The chairman is appointed on an annual basis by at least a majority vote of the other directors. Currently, the offices of chairman of the board and chief executive officer are separated. The company has no fixed policy with respect to the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and chief executive officer. The board believes that the separation of the offices of the chairman of the board and chief executive officer is part of the succession planning process and that it is in the best interests of the company to make this determination from time to time. 
When the chairman of the board is not an independent director, the board appoints the chairman of the nominating committee as the board's lead independent director. The company's Corporate Governance Guidelines describe the authority and duties of the lead director. These include chairing the executive sessions of board meetings without management present, facilitating the communication between the independent directors and management on matters of interest and participating in the preparation of meeting agendas and materials sent to directors. The independent directors meet in executive session, without management present, at every regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines - Our directors and officers are subject to stock ownership guidelines that set targets for levels of ownership at a multiple of the officer's salary or director's meeting fees. As of December 31, 2018, all of our directors and executive officers were in compliance with the guidelines. Director and Officer Ownership Guidelines are available on cinfin.com/investors.
Risk Management - The board believes that oversight of our risk management efforts is the responsibility of the entire board. It views enterprise risk management as an integral part of our strategic planning process. The subject of risk management is a recurring agenda item for which the board receives a report at each regularly scheduled board meeting from the chief risk officer, including in-person reports twice each year. The chief risk officer has direct access to all members of the board of directors.
Page 25
Additionally, the charters of certain of the board's committees assign oversight responsibility for particular areas of risk. For example, our audit committee oversees management of risks related to accounting, auditing and financial reporting, maintaining effective internal controls for financial reporting and cybersecurity. Our nominating committee oversees risk associated with our corporate governance and legal, regulatory and other nonfinancial compliance activities. Our compensation committee oversees the risk related to our executive compensation plans and arrangements. Our investment committee oversees the risks related to managing our investment portfolio. All of these risks are discussed with the entire board in the ordinary course of the chairperson's report of committee activities at regular board meetings.
Board Evaluations - The board annually conducts a self-evaluation. Led by the lead independent director, feedback from individual directors is reviewed and discussed first by the nominating committee and then with the entire board. These discussions include specific governance topics such as director tenure, board refreshment and composition as well as the diversity of experience, skills, competencies and other qualities of current directors and future director candidates. The board intends for this annual process to help inform its decisions about how to best structure and govern itself in the short- and long-term enabling it to provide effective oversight of the company for the benefit of shareholders.
Director Independence - Each year, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, the board determines which directors satisfy the criteria for independence. To be found independent, a director must not have a material relationship with the company, either directly or indirectly as a partner (other than a limited partner), controlling shareholder or executive officer of another organization that has a relationship with the company that could affect the director's ability to exercise independent judgment.
Directors deemed independent are believed to satisfy the definitions of independence required by the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of Nasdaq. The board has determined that these directors and nominees meet the applicable criteria for independence as of February 1, 2019: William F. Bahl, Gregory T. Bier, Linda W. Clement-Holmes, Dirk J. Debbink, Kenneth C. Lichtendahl, W. Rodney McMullen, David P. Osborn, Gretchen W. Price, Douglas S. Skidmore and John F. Steele, Jr. A majority, 10 of our current 14 directors, meet the applicable criteria for independence under Nasdaq listing standards.
Board Structure and Tenure -  The board balances its independence, size and tenure. Over time and without unnecessary disruption, its goal is to achieve a board with at least 75 percent of its directors qualifying as independent. The insurance business is complex, requiring new directors to develop a deep understanding of both our insurance operations and investment activities. Once this knowledge is acquired, the board expects that these directors will continue their board service for a significant period. As a consequence, the board expects the average tenure of its independent directors to be higher than average.
Page 26
Director Nomination Considerations and Process - The nominating committee considers many factors when determining the eligibility of candidates for nomination as director. The committee does not have a diversity policy; however, the committee's goal is to nominate candidates from a broad range of experiences and backgrounds who can contribute to the board's overall effectiveness in meeting its mission. The committee is charged with identifying nominees with certain characteristics:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Demonstrated character and integrity  
• An ability to work with others 
• Sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the company 
• Specific skills and experiences that enhance the board's diversity and acumen 
• Willingness to enter into a long-term association with the company, in keeping with the company's overall business strategy 
[END TABLE]
The nominating committee also considers the needs of the board in accounting and finance, business judgment, management, industry knowledge, leadership and such other areas as the board deems appropriate. The committee further considers factors included in the Corporate Governance Guidelines that might preclude nomination or renomination, including service on other public company boards. When a director is considering service on another public company's board, that director notifies the chairman of the board and the chairman of the nominating committee. Each year, when considering a director for renomination for election to the board, the nominating committee considers a director's service on other public company boards, weighing the potential benefit to our company against any potential negative impact of such service.
In particular, the nominating committee seeks to support our unique, agent-centered business model. The committee believes that the board should include a variety of individuals and should include independent insurance agents who bring a special knowledge of policyholders and agents in the communities where we do business.
Potential board nominees generally are identified by referral. The nominating committee follows a five-part process to evaluate nominees for director. The committee first performs an initial screening that includes reviewing background information on the candidates, evaluating their qualifications against the criteria set forth in the company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the skills and competencies that may be identified by the committee or the board as desirable in future director candidates. As it believes is appropriate, the committee may discuss the potential candidates with the individual or individuals making the referrals. Second, for candidates who qualify for additional consideration, the committee interviews the potential nominees as to their background, business acumen, interests and potential commitment to the company and its operating philosophy. Third, the committee may seek references from sources identified by the candidates as well as sources known to the committee members. Fourth, the committee may ask other members of the board for their input. Finally, the committee develops a list of nominees who exhibit the characteristics desired of directors that satisfy the needs of the board.
The nominating committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders. Shareholders wishing to propose a candidate for consideration may provide information about such a candidate in writing to the secretary of the company, giving the candidate's name, biographical data and qualifications, and emphasizing the characteristics set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available on cinfin.com/investors. Preferably, any such referral would contain sufficient information to enable the committee to preliminarily screen the referred candidate for the needs of the board, if any, in accounting and finance, business judgment, management, industry knowledge, leadership and the board's independence requirements. 
Since the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, no fees were paid to any third party to identify, evaluate or assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees.

Communicating with the Board - Shareholders may direct a communication to board members by sending it to the attention of the corporate secretary of the company, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, P.O. Box 145496, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45250-5496. The company and board of directors have not established a formal process for determining whether all shareholder communication received by the corporate secretary will be forwarded to directors. The board welcomes shareholder communication and has instructed the corporate secretary to use reasonable criteria to determine whether correspondence should be forwarded. The board believes that correspondence has been and will continue to be forwarded appropriately. However, exceptions may occur, and the board does not intend to provide management with instructions that limit its ability to make reasonable business decisions. Examples of exceptions would be routine items such as requests for publicly available information that can be provided by company associates; vendor solicitations that appear to be mass-directed to board members of a number of companies; or correspondence that raises issues related to specific company transactions (insurance policies or claims) where there may be privacy concerns or other issues.
In some circumstances, the board anticipates that management would provide the board or board members with summary information regarding correspondence.

Certain Relationships and Transactions
The audit committee follows a written policy for review and approval of transactions involving the company and related persons, defined as directors and executive officers or their immediate family members, or shareholders owning 5 percent or more of our outstanding common shares. The policy covers any related-party transaction that meets the minimum threshold for disclosure in the proxy statement under the relevant SEC rules, generally transactions involving amounts exceeding $120,000 in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. 
As it examines individual transactions for approval, the committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction creates a conflict of interest or would violate the company's Code of Conduct 
• Whether the transaction would impair the independence of a director 
• Whether the transaction would be fair 
• Any other factor the committee deems appropriate 
[END TABLE]
Consideration of transactions with related parties is a regular item on the audit committee's agenda. Most of the transactions fall into the categories of standard agency contracts with directors who are principals of independent insurance agencies that sell our insurance products or with directors and executive officers who purchase our insurance products on the same terms as such products are offered to the public. Because the committee does not believe these classes of transactions create conflicts of interest or otherwise violate our Code of Conduct, the committee deems such transactions preapproved. 
The following transactions in 2018 with related persons were determined to pose no actual conflict of interest and were approved by the committee pursuant to its policy:
Thomas R. Schiff is a director of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and the chief executive officer of John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co. Inc., a privately owned insurance agency that represents a number of insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries paid John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co. Inc. fees and commissions of $6,139,958. The company purchased various insurance policies through John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co. Inc. for premiums totaling $997,326. John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co. Inc. paid rent to the company in the amount of $122,445 for office space located in the headquarters building and purchased property casualty insurance from our insurance subsidiaries for premiums totaling $136,395.
Dirk J. Debbink is a director of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and principal owner, director and chief executive officer of MSI General Corporation, and is a control person for several development limited liability companies, which on a consolidated basis purchased property casualty and life insurance from our insurance subsidiaries for premiums totaling $169,584.

Compensation of Named Executive Officers and Directors
Proposal 2 - Say-on-Pay: Advisory Vote on Compensation of Named Executive Officers
We conduct a say-on-pay vote each year at the annual shareholder meeting. This say-on-pay vote is required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and the related rules of the SEC. Although the say-on-pay vote is nonbinding, the compensation committee (Committee) considers the voting results as part of its annual evaluation of our executive compensation program. The annual frequency was selected by more than 90 percent of our shareholders who voted on the proposal at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
In 2018, our industry experienced a second consecutive year of elevated levels of insured losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophic weather events. It also was a year that ended with a sharp decline in the equity markets. Your company delivered strong operating results and somewhat mixed financial performance that benefited shareholders with one-year and three-year total shareholder returns of 6.2 percent and 43.0 percent, respectively; a 4.4 percent decrease in book value; and a 6.0 percent increase in regular cash dividends declared. This performance generated payouts of annual incentive compensation and performance-based restricted stock units at threshold levels for our named executive officers. 
Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section for more detailed information about our executive compensation program and decisions to inform your vote on the following say-on-pay proposal:
"RESOLVED, that the company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the company's proxy statement for the Cincinnati Financial Corporation 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and narrative disclosure."
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting that are entitled to vote on this proposal is required for approval. Votes to abstain have the same effect as votes against the proposal. Broker nonvotes have no effect on the voting for this proposal.
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.

Executive Summary
Overview
Cincinnati Financial Corporation is one of the 25 largest property casualty insurers in the nation, based on net written premium volume from our insurance subsidiary. The U.S. property casualty insurance industry is a highly competitive marketplace with more than 2,000 stock and mutual companies operating independently or in groups. We compete with these companies, which offer standard market property casualty and/or excess and surplus lines and life insurance products as we do, seeking to increase our share of these multibillion-dollar markets. Critical to our long-term success are highly experienced, dedicated and capable executives who can manage our business day to day and who possess the vision to plan for and adjust to changes in the market. The objective of our executive compensation program is to attract, motivate, reward, develop and retain the executive talent required for our long-term success. We also must nurture the capabilities of our emerging leaders to ensure that we have an appropriate depth of executive talent. We believe that as an associate's level of responsibility increases, so should the proportion of performance-based compensation. As a result, our executive compensation program aims to tie a meaningful level of each officer's compensation to awards that require achievement of the primary financial objectives by which we measure the company's performance, creating a firm link between pay and performance.
2018 Business and Financial Highlights 
In 2018, our industry experienced a second consecutive year of elevated levels of insured losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophic weather events. It also was a year that ended with a sharp decline in the equity markets. Your company delivered strong operating results and somewhat mixed financial performance that benefited shareholders with one-year and three-year total shareholder returns of 6.2 percent and 43.0 percent, respectively; a 4.4 percent decrease in book value; and a 6.0 percent increase in regular cash dividends declared. This performance generated payouts of annual incentive compensation and performance-based restricted stock units at threshold levels for our named executive officers. Highlights of our company's performance in 2018 included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A 45 percent increase in underwriting profit to $186 million and a combined ratio of 96.4 percent for 2018, marking our seventh consecutive year of underwriting profit. In 2018, our efforts to further segment our renewal and new business opportunities with better pricing precision and risk-selection decisions continued to benefit underwriting performance.  
• An all-time record-level of consolidated property casualty new business written premiums at $652 million, up 4 percent, driven by new agency appointment contributions. 
• A 4 percent increase in consolidated property casualty net written premiums to more than $5 billion in 2018. The increase in premiums reflects our growth initiatives, modest average price increases for most lines of business and a higher level of insured exposures.  
[END TABLE]
Page 33
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A $4 million improvement in life insurance subsidiary net income, largely due to decreased income taxes as a result of tax reform, after factoring out the 2017 $111 million benefit from revaluation of deferred income taxes due to tax reform. 
• $17.516 billion in consolidated cash and invested assets, down 1 percent over the prior year. 
• A 2 percent increase in pretax investment income to a record $619 million, net of expenses, reflecting a 6 percent increase in equity portfolio dividends and flat interest income. 
• A value creation ratio (VCR) of negative 0.1 percent for 2018, exceeding that measure for three of the nine companies in our peer group. Our average annual VCR for the five-year period ending December 31, 2018, is 10.7 percent, within our announced goal of producing an annual average VCR of 10 percent to 13 percent in any five-year period. 
[END TABLE]
We consider VCR to be our primary performance metric for two reasons. First, we believe this measure captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance we place on paying cash dividends to shareholders. Second, as demonstrated in the chart below, the VCR has historically been directly correlated to the returns experienced by our shareholders for their investment in our common stock over the long term.
Start with $1 Invested in 1987...
We believe that when we operate our business to achieve a VCR consistently within our targeted range, we create value for shareholders over time, through share price appreciation and dividends paid to shareholders that have increased for 58 consecutive years. Through the cash dividends paid and share repurchases, we returned $461 million to shareholders in 2018, and $1.298 billion during the three years ended December 31, 2018.
Relationship Between Company Performance and 
Chief Executive Officer Compensation
Generally the Committee expects that when the company's performance adds or preserves more value for shareholders than its peers, that compensation for the named executive officers, including the chief executive officer, will be higher than when the company's performance lags its peers. Accordingly, the primary performance metrics for both annual and long-term performance-based compensation are calibrated to the company's performance compared with the companies in the peer group. At the same time, the Committee expects compensation to directionally correlate with the company's actual performance for these metrics, particularly when considered over the long term. The following graph illustrates the directional relationships between company performance, based on the two primary performance metrics used in our performance-based awards, and the compensation of our chief executive officer for each of the three years ending 2018.

* For the annual performance period ending December 31, 2018, the company's VCR exceeded that of three Peer Group companies. The additional performance goals for net written premium growth and combined ratio were not met and did not affect final award placement or payout. For the annual performance period ending December 31, 2017, the company's VCR exceeded that of all nine of the Peer Group companies, achieving the maximum award placement level. The additional performance goals for net written premium growth and combined ratio were not met and did not affect final award placement or payout. For the annual performance period ending December 31, 2016, the company's VCR exceeded that of eight Peer Group companies and achievement of the additional performance goals for net written premium growth and combined ratio were met and increased relative peer placement by one, but did not affect award payout.

Our performance over the last three years exceeded four of the nine companies of our peer group as measured by three-year total shareholder return. As suggested by the Three-Year Relative Pay for Performance graph below, total realizable compensation1 for our chief executive officer and the other named executive officers over the same period remains comparatively low, ranking near the 28th percentile, largely reflecting the size of several of the companies included in the peer group. While we do not benchmark executive compensation to the peer group, our performance is judged against those companies with whom we compete every day for each insurance policy we write, regardless of the size of those companies.

Results of 2018 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, more than 96 percent of the votes cast were in favor of this proposal. The Committee believes this favorable outcome demonstrates support of its decisions and of our overall executive compensation program. Our annual discussions with investors confirm this belief. All of the shareholders contacted during our annual investor engagement efforts in 2018 favorably commented on the company's executive compensation program, criteria for performance-based awards and overall level of pay. The Committee made no material changes in the structure of our compensation program in 2018 as a result of feedback from investors. At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we will again hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation (see Page 31). The Committee will continue to consider the results of these annual advisory votes and feedback from investor outreach in its deliberations about our executive compensation program.
Executive Compensation Practices
The Committee applies certain fundamentals that are key characteristics of our overall compensation program, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
We Do We Don't 
Link Pay to Performance - The majority of pay awarded by the Committee to each executive officer each year is tied to achievement of short- and long-term performance objectives and changes in the market value of the company's common stock. Use Employment Contracts - We employ all of our executive officers at will. 
Review Data Sheets - Each year the Committee reviews data recounting the compensation history for each executive officer. For the named executive officers, the Committee additionally reviews compensation and performance data for the companies in the peer group before making executive compensation decisions. Benchmark Executive Compensation - We review compensation program structures and resulting payouts of the companies in our Peer Group to maintain an awareness of pay levels and practices. We do not benchmark the compensation we pay our named executive officers to achieve a specific level of pay, for example "above the median" of our Peer Group.  
Mitigate Excessive Risk - Compensation earned from performance-based awards is capped and is subject to clawback policies and provisions. Company-level performance objectives relative to peers minimizes the ability of any single individual or business unit to control its own performance-based compensation. The Committee's authority to exercise negative discretion and eliminate payment of any award also is a powerful risk control. Pay Dividends or Dividend Equivalents - We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested stock awards.

Company-level performance objectives relative to peers minimizes the ability of any single individual or business unit to control its own performance-based compensation. The Committee's authority to exercise negative discretion and eliminate payment of any award also is a powerful risk control. Pay Dividends or Dividend Equivalents - We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested stock awards.  
Use Double-Trigger Change in Control Provisions - Both our annual incentive and stock-based compensation plans include double-trigger change in control provisions.  Reprice or Exchange Stock Options - We do not reprice or exchange stock options. We consider stock options to be performance-based compensation that links the financial success of our associates to shareholders. Since shareholders cannot reprice or exchange their shares, neither do we.   
Perform Compensation Risk Assessments - Our chief risk officer performs this assessment each year, and it is considered by the Committee as part of its decision making process. Include Stock-Based Awards in Calculations for Pension or Other Retirement Benefits - Our pension is calculated based on salary only, and our matches to 401(k) and Top Hat Savings Plan contributions are limited to cash compensation.

Track Compliance with Ownership Guidelines - All of our directors and executive officers are in compliance with our published stock ownership guidelines. Allow Hedging Transactions by Executive Officers or Directors - Our Securities Trading Policy prohibits transactions such as short sales, prepaid forward sales contracts or other hedging transactions that we believe decouple the director's or officer's interests from those shared by our shareholders generally.

Components of Compensation
Total direct compensation (TDC) is the compensation annually determined or awarded each year by the Committee. TDC generally is the sum of three components: base annual salary, target levels of annual incentive cash compensation and long-term equity compensation comprised of target levels of performance-based and service-based equity compensation. As illustrated in the following charts, in 2018, approximately 69 percent of TDC awarded to the chief executive officer and 56 percent of the TDC awarded to the other named executive officers was considered performance-based and not guaranteed. 
Base Annual Salary
We use base annual salary to attract executive talent and to provide adequate and stable compensation. The Committee reviews and sets base annual salaries for the named executive officers each year. In determining base annual salary, the Committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The officer's role and responsibilities, 
• Fairness, as compared with officers with similar responsibilities, experience and performance, 
• Current compensation level, and 
• Individual performance. 
[END TABLE]
Base annual salaries may be adjusted to reflect annual merit increases, if any; promotions or changes in role or responsibilities; and market adjustments.
The base annual salaries for the named executive officers were adjusted in February 2018 to recognize the strong individual contribution of each officer to the company's strong performance in the prior year. On average, base annual salary for the group increased approximately 4.5 percent. On an individual basis, each named executive officer's salary was adjusted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Johnston, an increase of 3.0 percent to $1,030,000; 
• For Mr. Scherer, an increase of 3.0 percent to $953,424; 
• For Mr. Sewell, an increase of 5.0 percent to $857,500; 
• For Mr. Hollenbeck, an increase of 5.0 percent to $715,804; and 
• For Mr. Mullen, an increase of 8.5 percent to $624,445.  
[END TABLE]
Page 39
Annual Incentive Compensation
We pay annual incentive compensation to encourage achievement of key short-term performance objectives believed to be important for achievement of longer-term strategic goals. Under the shareholder-approved Annual Incentive Compensation Plan of 2009, as amended (2009 Annual Incentive Plan), each executive officer is eligible to annually receive an award of up to $3 million in cash based on achievement of specific performance-based criteria. 
The 2009 Annual Incentive Plan offers a wide range of performance objectives from which the Committee may choose. The specific performance objectives, hurdles and targets for each year are contained in the award agreements delivered to the individual officer. The 2009 Annual Incentive Plan also features a forfeiture and recoupment provision to enable the company to recover payments under this plan when circumstances warrant. Awards of incentive compensation tie vesting of a portion of annual cash compensation to performance goals.
Performance Objectives
The Committee uses a multi-metric formula that incorporates three performance objectives. The primary performance objective is our one-year value creation ratio (VCR) relative to our peer group. We believe this measure captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance we place on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio is a two-part metric: 1) our rate of growth in book value per share, plus 2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. We are targeting an annual VCR averaging 10 percent to 13 percent over the next five-year period. Two company-specific performance objectives also are used by the Committee to emphasize the importance of consistent profitable growth. These company-specific performance objectives are: 1) revenue as measured by property casualty net written premium growth (premium growth goal), and 2) underwriting profitability as measured by the combined ratio (combined ratio goal). When both operating goals of premium growth and combined ratio are achieved, the company's relative placement among the peer group companies may be improved by up to three placements to determine the final award placement. For the named executive officers, the maximum effect of the addition of these two performance objectives is capped at one additional payout level, for example from a threshold to a target-level payout, but not from a threshold to a maximum-level payout. 
Setting Target Amounts
Target amounts for annual incentive compensation are set by the Committee each year as a percentage of the named executive officer's salary. In 2018, the percentage of salary ranged from 65 percent to 110 percent based on the named executive officer's tier. Assignment to a particular tier was based on level of responsibility. In 2018, Mr. Johnston was assigned to the chief executive officer's tier for which the target-level award was 110 percent of base annual salary. The remaining named executive officers were assigned to Tier I for which target-level awards were 65 percent of base annual salary. 
Page 40
Determining Final Award Placement
Determination of the final award placement is a three-step process:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Step 1 - The Committee determines the company's baseline award placement among the peer group companies based on relative VCR. As in prior years, when the company's VCR exceeds the VCR of one or more of the companies in the peer group, the company's baseline award placement increases by one for each peer group company exceeded. 
• Step 2 - The Committee determines whether the company achieved the pre-established premium growth goal. For 2018, the growth goal was 2.0 percent or more. If the company does not achieve the growth goal, then the final award placement is the baseline award placement determined in Step 1. If the growth goal is achieved, then the final award placement is determined by Step 3. 
• Step 3 - The Committee determines the achievement of the final award placement based on achievement of the combined ratio goal. The combined ratio goal for 2018 awards is as follows: 
◦ When the combined ratio is 95.0 percent or better, the company's baseline award placement improves by one placement. 
◦ When the combined ratio is 93.0 percent or better, the company's baseline award placement improves by two placements. 
◦ When the combined ratio is 91.0 percent or better, the company's baseline award placement improves by three placements. 
[END TABLE]
If the company does not achieve the combined ratio goal, then the final award placement is the baseline award placement determined in Step 1.
Setting Performance Hurdles
Performance hurdles for threshold, target and maximum awards were set at the 30th, 50th and 75th percentiles, respectively, of the peer group. Stated another way, the final award placement must exceed three of the nine peer companies to achieve the threshold hurdle, must equal or exceed five peer companies to achieve the target hurdle and must equal or exceed seven peer companies to achieve the maximum hurdle. Achievement of threshold, target and maximum performance hurdles earns award payouts of 30 percent, 100 percent and 200 percent, respectively, of target. If the final award placement does not exceed at least three of the peer companies, no annual incentive compensation is earned or paid.
Page 41
Calculating the Annual Incentive Award Earned
Step 1: Determining the Baseline Award Placement Using Relative VCR
As shown in the following chart, for 2018, the company achieved a value creation ratio of -0.1 percent, which exceeded the value creation ratio achieved by three peer companies. This established the baseline award placement of exceeding three peer companies.
Step 2: Determining Achievement of Premium Growth Goal
The premium growth goal for awards granted in 2018 was 2.0 percent or more. The company reported property casualty net written premium growth of 4.0 percent, satisfying the 2018 premium growth goal.
Step 3: Determining Achievement of Combined Ratio Goal
The company reported a property casualty combined ratio of 96.4 percent, which failed to satisfy the combined ratio goal.
Because the company did not achieve the combined ratio goal, the final award placement is the baseline award placement determined in Step 1, specifically a final award placement that exceeds three of the peer group companies. A final award placement that exceeds three of the peer group companies satisfies the performance hurdle for a threshold-level award payout of 30 percent of target.

The following formula is used to calculate the annual incentive award earned:
Base Annual Salary X Tier Target% X Performance Factor (0 - 200%)

Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation
General
We award stock-based compensation not only to reward service to the company, but also to provide incentive for individuals to remain in the employ of the company and help it prosper. We believe people tend to value and protect most that which they have paid for, generally by investing their time, effort or personal funds. Over the long run, we believe shareholders are better served when associates at all levels have a significant component of their financial net worth invested in the company. For that reason, we grant awards of stock-based compensation not only to our directors and to named executive officers, but also generally to all full-time salaried associates of the company who are in good standing. We believe this approach encourages associates at all levels to make decisions in the best interest of the company as a whole, linking their personal financial success with the company's success. Although we do not have access to information about broker accounts, we estimate that approximately 80 percent of our current associates hold shares of Cincinnati Financial Corporation. Stock ownership guidelines applicable to all directors and officers help the Committee monitor ownership for all directors and officers. Our Director and Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines can be found at cinfin.com/investors.
Stock-based awards granted to all associates in February 2018, totaled less than 1 percent of total shares outstanding. In 2018, approximately 43 percent of all stock-based awards were granted to the company's executive officers, including the named executive officers, and approximately 57 percent were granted to nearly 3,600 other company associates. All stock-based awards are granted at 100 percent of fair value on the date of grant.
Page 43
Types of Stock-Based Awards
The Committee grants three types of stock-based awards to the named executive officers: nonqualified stock options, performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs) and service-vesting restricted stock units (RSUs). The Committee finds these awards effective because stock options have value only if there is a corresponding increase in value recognized by shareholders, while PSUs focus executives on the sustained long-term performance of the company regardless of short-term stock price fluctuations. RSUs further emphasize the long-term focus and strengthen the alignment of financial interests shared by executives and shareholders, and supports retention of executive talent. Both stock options and PSUs granted prior to November 2, 2017, were intended to qualify as performance-based, tax-deductible executive compensation. The named executive officers also are eligible to receive shares under the Holiday Stock Plan. We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested stock-based awards.
Stock Options - For the named executive officers, the Committee uses nonqualified stock options that vest and become exercisable in equal amounts over the three years following the grant date. We consider stock options to be performance-based compensation, because the associate recognizes value only if the market value of our stock appreciates over time. Stock options tie the compensation realized from such awards, if any, to changes in the stock price experienced by shareholders. When the stock price does not increase, the stock options do not have value. We do not, and have not, backdated, repriced or exchanged stock options.
PSUs - For the named executive officers, the Committee uses PSUs that cliff vest after three years if performance targets are achieved. PSUs tie vesting of a portion of stock-based compensation to performance goals, and the three-year performance period for awards of PSUs reinforces the company's long-term focus and matches the period after which stock option awards are fully vested and exercisable. If performance hurdles are achieved and an award of PSUs vests, the award is paid in shares of common stock, one share for each restricted stock unit. For PSUs, the Committee expects to set targets that it considers achievable, but that require some stretch, based on market conditions and the current insurance industry environment at the time of grant. 
Since November 2008, the performance objective for PSUs has been three-year total shareholder return relative to the companies in the peer group. The Committee selected this measure because total shareholder return combines share price appreciation and dividends paid. It measures the total return achieved for the shareholder and the relative position reflects the market perception of overall performance relative to the peer group.
RSUs - For the named executive officers, the Committee uses RSUs that ratably vest in thirds over three years. The Committee uses RSUs as a regular component of compensation for the named executive officers to place additional emphasis on long-term compensation, aid retention and strengthen the alignment of executive officer and shareholder financial interests.
Page 44
Setting Target Amounts for Stock-Based Awards
Target amounts for performance-based stock compensation (nonqualified stock options and PSUs) are set by the Committee as a percentage of the named executive officer's salary. For 2018, the percentage of salary ranged from 97.5 percent to 165 percent (which amounts are 150 percent of annual incentive targets) based on the named executive officer's tier. Assignment to a particular tier was based on level of responsibility. In 2018, Mr. Johnston was assigned to the chief executive officer's tier for which the target level award was 165 percent of base annual salary. The remaining named executive officers were assigned to Tier I for which target level awards were 97.5 percent of base annual salary. The target dollar amount is then allocated between stock options and PSUs. The number of stock options granted is determined by dividing the target dollar amount by the intrinsic value of the stock option on the date of grant. That intrinsic value represents an estimate of fair value of each stock option granted, based on a modeled future market price of our stock less the exercise price applicable to that stock option. For option grants issued during 2018, that intrinsic value was $10.02 per share. Assumptions related to that value are disclosed in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K note that describes share-based associate compensation plans. The number of PSUs granted is determined by dividing the target dollar amount by the fair value of the company's stock on the date of grant. For 2018, the target value for stock awards was allocated 50 percent to PSUs and 50 percent to stock options. The following formulas were used to calculate the number of shares underlying the grants of performance-based stock compensation:
For nonqualified stock options:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Annual Salary X Tier Target% X Award Allocation% = Target # of Shares Underlying Award 
Intrinsic Value of Stock Option on Date of Grant 
[END TABLE]
For PSUs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Annual Salary X Tier Target% X Award Allocation% = Target # of Shares Underlying Award 
Grant Date Fair Value 
[END TABLE]
Until 2017, the Committee historically used the grant date fair value as the denominator to determine the number of shares for both nonqualified stock options and PSUs. In 2017, the Committee changed the denominator for calculating the number of stock options to the option's intrinsic value on the date of grant. This change produces awards of a greater number of stock options than in prior years, as intended by the Committee to add greater weight to long-term equity compensation. 
Similarly, the Committee sets amounts for RSUs as a percentage of the named executive officer's salary. In 2017, the Committee increased the number of RSUs granted, increasing the percentage of base salary used to determine the grant date value of awards to 25 percent of base annual salary. This change produces awards of a greater number of RSUs than in prior years, as intended by the Committee to add greater weight to long-term equity compensation. 
The following formula is used to calculate the number of shares underlying each grant of RSUs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Annual Salary X 25% = # of Shares Underlying Award 
Grant Date Fair Value

2018 Stock-Based Grants
At its meeting on February 9, 2018, the Committee granted the following stock-based awards to the named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name # Nonqualified Stock Options # PSUs # RSUs 
Steven J. Johnston 84,765 11,937 3,618 
Jacob F. Scherer, Jr. 46,365 6,529 3,349

Martin F. Hollenbeck 34,810 4,902 2,514 
Martin J. Mullen 30,367 4,277 2,193 
[END TABLE]
For the PSUs granted in 2018, performance hurdles for threshold, target and maximum awards were set at the 30th, 50th and 75th percentiles, respectively, of the peer group. Stated another way, the company's three-year total shareholder return must exceed that of three of the nine peer companies to achieve the threshold hurdle, must equal or exceed that of five peer companies to achieve the target hurdle and must equal or exceed that of seven peer companies to achieve the maximum hurdle. For PSUs granted in 2018, achievement of threshold, target and maximum performance hurdles earns award payouts of 30 percent, 100 percent and 200 percent, respectively, of target. If the company's three-year total shareholder return does not exceed that of at least three of the peer companies, no shares from the award are earned or paid.
The following formula describes how the Committee calculates the number of shares earned:
Target # of Shares Underlying Award X Performance Factor (0 - 200%)
The performance period for the PSUs awarded in 2018 is the three calendar years ending December 31, 2020. The PSUs will vest and become payable on March 1, 2021, if the company achieves one of the performance hurdles described in the preceding paragraph.

Compensation Realized From PSUs Granted in Prior Years
The company's three-year TSR for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018, was 43.0 percent, exceeding that metric for four of the nine companies in the peer group and earning payout at the threshold level of 30 percent of the target number of shares.

Other Stock-Based Compensation
The named executive officers are eligible to receive stock bonuses under the company's broad-based Holiday Stock Plan, which annually awards one share of common stock to each full‑time associate in good standing for each year of service, up to a maximum of 10 shares. This plan, in effect since 1976, encourages stock ownership at all levels of the company.
Policy on Hedging and Pledging of Company Stock
Hedging - All of our officers and directors and certain associates identified by management as having regular access to potentially material, nonpublic information are prohibited from engaging in any form of hedging or monetization transactions involving the company's stock. Such transactions can decouple the officer's or director's interest from the interests of shareholders generally and can limit the officer's or director's ability to control the timing of stock transactions to avoid times when in possession of material nonpublic information. 
Pledging - We enjoy a strong culture of ownership, linking the long-term financial prospects for our associates to the long-term financial prospects for our shareholders generally through broad-based grants of equity compensation awards. Some of our associates, including some executive officers, choose to build their ownership in the company by pledging shares they own to collateralize loans from banks or brokers to exercise employee stock options. Some directors, officers and associates choose to hold their shares of stock in street name in accounts with banks or brokers as a matter of convenience. Depending on individual circumstances and decisions, these accounts can be subject to margin or collateral requirements.
Page 47
Accordingly, we permit our directors, officers and associates to pledge shares of company stock that they own. The board expects directors and executive officers to exercise good judgment when making decisions about their holdings and transactions involving company stock, including pledging. The board anticipates that the level of share pledging by directors and executive officers will decrease over time. In 2018, the number of shares pledged by our directors and executive officers as a group increased approximately 27,000 shares from 2017 levels as shares earned as stock compensation by certain executive officers were added to existing bank or broker accounts in which the number of shares previously owned significantly exceeded any loan amounts.
A majority, 17 of our current 27 directors and executive officers, do not pledge any shares. Another group of nine have pledged shares totaling less than 0.2 percent of the shares outstanding. One director with pledged shares is a member of one of the company's founding families, with reported holdings of company stock that sufficiently outnumber the approximately 0.4 percent of shares outstanding that he holds in accounts and are available as collateral. 
Stock-Based Award Grant Practices
In awarding stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, the Committee follows certain general precepts:
Timing - Since 2010, the Committee established its February meeting as the date for granting stock-based compensation to company associates each year. This meeting is purposely scheduled to occur shortly after the company announces its financial results for the preceding quarter and year, and therefore occurs when it does not expect to be in possession of material nonpublic information. The Committee makes its grants of restricted stock to directors under the Directors' Stock Plan of 2018  at its first regularly scheduled meeting of the year. The Committee believes the consistency of these practices eliminates concerns over timing. When grants are made at any other time of the year, the Committee ensures that such grants are made outside of any regular trading blackout associated with the company's disclosure of financial results and when the company is not otherwise in possession of material nonpublic information.
Option Exercise Price - All stock-based compensation is granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Under all stock-based compensation plans, fair market value is defined as the average of the high and low sale price on Nasdaq on the grant date. Unless a future date is specified, the grant date is the date of the Committee meeting at which the grant is made. The Committee does not delegate timing or pricing of these stock-based awards to management. 
Retirement Benefits 
Defined Benefit Plans
In 2018, Messrs. Scherer and Mullen were participants in The Cincinnati Financial Corporation Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan), our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. There are no special or enhanced pension formulas for the named executive officers, compared with other plan participants. The Retirement Plan was frozen and closed to new participants in mid-2008. Participants remaining in the Retirement Plan continue to accrue a benefit as prescribed by the plan's terms.
These two named executive officers also participate in The Cincinnati Financial Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is unfunded and subject to forfeiture in the event of bankruptcy.
The SERP is a nontax-qualified defined benefit plan maintained by the company to pay eligible associates the difference between the amount payable under the tax-qualified plan and the amount they 
Page 48
would have received without the tax-qualified plan's limit due to Section 401(a)(17) and Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the SERP definitions for service, normal retirement and annual earnings are the same as those for the Retirement Plan except the SERP's definition of annual earnings is not limited. 
For information about accumulated benefits under these plans and detailed information about the plans, see the 2018 Pension Benefits table and the discussion following, beginning on Page 63.
Defined Contribution Plans
The named executive officers can participate in a tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan as well as the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Top Hat Savings Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of management or certain highly compensated associates. The company matches contributions to the 401(k) plan made by associates who are not members of the Retirement Plan, including Messrs. Johnston, Sewell and Hollenbeck, up to a maximum of 6 percent of the associate's annual cash compensation (salary and annual incentive compensation). The company also matches contributions by Messrs. Johnston, Sewell and Hollenbeck to the Top Hat Savings Plan of up to 6 percent of their annual cash compensation that exceeds the maximum recognizable compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, which for 2018 was $275,000.
For information about the amount of company matching contributions and specific information about the defined contribution plans, see the 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table and the discussion following, beginning on Page 65.
In 2008, the company transitioned away from providing associates with a defined benefit pension plan, instead choosing to assist associates with building savings for retirement by providing a company match of associate contributions to a tax-qualified 401(k) plan. This change was primarily in response to requests from associates who wanted control over their retirement benefit accounts. Participation in the defined benefit pension plan terminated for associates under the age of 40, and they transitioned to the new tax-qualified 401(k) plan with a company matching contribution. None of the named executive officers were under age 40 at the time of the transition. Associates age 40 and over as of August 31, 2008, were given a one-time election to remain in the defined benefit pension plan or to leave the plan and participate in the 401(k) plan with a company match. Those associates leaving the pension plan received distributions of their accumulated pension benefit from the defined benefit plan that they could choose to receive in cash, roll over to the company's 401(k) plan or roll over to an Individual Retirement Account. Mr. Hollenbeck elected to leave the defined benefit plan in connection with the 2008 transition. Messrs. Johnston and Sewell, hired after entry to the pension plan was closed, also participate in the 401(k) plan with the company match. Messrs. Scherer and Mullen elected to remain in the pension plan.
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Perquisites and other personal benefits are intended to support our corporate objectives or the performance of an individual's responsibilities. Perquisites and personal benefits are offered to the named executive officers on the same basis as to other company officers and may include employer-paid health insurance premiums, personal umbrella liability insurance coverage, life insurance, executive tax services, use of a company car, safe driver award, executive health exams, club dues and limited spouse travel and meals associated with certain business functions. The Committee believes that the level of perquisites and personal benefits we offer our officers is de minimis, totaling no more than $34,564 for any named executive officer in 2018. 
Page 49
CEO Pay Ratio 
We are committed to transparency about our compensation practices. We provide detailed and comprehensive public disclosure about how the Committee structures our executive compensation program and makes individual compensation decisions for the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers each year. Internally, we provide transparency by publishing detailed information about salary bands for all positions. For annual cash incentive bonuses, we internally publish the bonus targets expressed as percentages of base annual compensation and provide a "bonus estimator" for associates to use to model how their annual incentive bonuses are affected by the company's performance. Transparency was further enhanced in 2012, when we aligned all associate bonuses (from entry-level positions to our senior executives) to the same performance criteria. Since 2017, we also provide every associate with a "Current Compensation" summary that provides a total annual compensation value that is the sum of that associate's base annual pay, the amount of the last annual incentive bonus paid and the value of the last paid restricted stock unit award. We also provide a full historical summary of all stock-compensation awards. We expect that the CEO Pay Ratio disclosure will further enhance our transparency about compensation. 
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. As permitted by the rule, because there were no significant changes to our compensation programs or employee base in 2018, we used the same median employee for the 2018 ratio as we used for 2017. In 2017, we identified the median employee by examining the annual total compensation for all of our associates, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 1, 2017. We included all associates, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis. To determine the median employee, we calculated the total annual compensation for each of our then 5,072 associates as the sum of the following amounts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual base pay 
• Increase in the value of the associate's pension benefit 
• The company's contribution to the associate's health insurance coverage  
• The company's matching contributions to the associate's 401(k) account 
• The company's matching contributions to the associate's nonqualified deferred compensation (top hat) account  
• Calendar year cash bonus 
• Calendar year stock compensation grants (time and or performance vesting restricted stock units) 
• Calendar year stock option grants (incentive or nonqualified stock options) 
• Holiday stock compensation  
[END TABLE]
We believe the use of these components for all associates is a consistently applied compensation measure that includes all of the compensation elements that are widely distributed throughout our organization, including retirement benefits. 
After identifying the median employee based on the process described above, we calculated annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement. The total annual compensation calculated for our CEO was $3,444,610 and for our median employee was $88,046. The resulting ratio for our CEO's pay compared with the pay of our median employee for 2018 is 39.1 to 1.

How We Make Compensation Decisions
Annual Compensation Setting Process
The Committee evaluates and sets compensation for the named executive officers annually. In doing so, it considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Its judgment about the effectiveness of the executive compensation program generally; 
• The effect of any changes to the program; 
• The result of the most recent shareholder advisory vote to approve executive compensation and feedback about the executive compensation program received from shareholders during annual outreach calls; 
• The compensation risk assessment conducted by the company's chief risk officer; 
• Current and historical compensation and performance data supplied by the chief executive officer for each named executive officer, excluding himself; 
• Reports generated through Equilar on the amounts and components of compensation paid to the named executive officers of the companies in the peer group; 
• Reports generated through Equilar on the financial performance of the companies in the peer group; 
• Each officer's individual performance, experience, expertise and functional responsibilities; and 
• Company performance, both financial and nonfinancial. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee meets in February each year to set base annual salaries, grant stock-based and incentive cash compensation awards and consider the payment of any performance-based compensation earned upon satisfaction of performance goals established in prior years' award grants. The Committee also may meet during the year to set or adjust compensation appropriately if management changes or new executive officers join the company or to consider potential prospective changes to the structure of the executive compensation program.
Compensation Risk Considerations
The Committee is responsible for overseeing the risk associated with the company's compensation program. The company's compensation plans and executive compensation program are designed with features intended to mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of the compensation. We believe our compensation plans and programs encourage and reward prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking, and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the company.
In 2018, the Committee considered the annual compensation risk assessment conducted by the chief risk officer. For the executive compensation program, the risk assessment identified the component parts of the program and the information and process used by the Committee to set the level of compensation for each. Independence and qualifications of committee members and rigor of the committee's oversight and administration of the executive compensation program also were examined.

Benchmarking and Peer Group
We believe that increasing compensation for our named executive officers to achieve a benchmark at or above the median of our peers would serve only to increase compensation expense without a corresponding benefit to shareholders. Our approach is to consider competitive compensation practices and relevant factors about executive compensation program structures and award types used by the companies in our Peer Group to maintain an awareness of pay levels and practices, which as one of many factors considered each year by the Committee may influence appropriate changes to our executive compensation structure and levels over time. This approach provides us with flexibility in maintaining and enhancing our executive officers' focus, motivation and enthusiasm for our future while controlling overall compensation expense. We believe our levels of compensation are competitively reasonable and appropriate for our business needs and circumstances.
We do use the peer group to compare our performance to those companies against whom we compete each day, irrespective of the size of any peer company. We believe that it is important to link performance-based compensation to company performance compared with peers. Accordingly, the primary performance targets for our annual incentive compensation and PSUs are relative targets compared with our peer group. We also believe that linking the level of performance-based awards to a percentage of base annual salary that is paid out according to a predetermined formula based upon achievement of performance goals for all of our executive officers unites the personal financial interests of the executive team, focusing its attention on achievement of performance goals designed to increase shareholder value over the long term. 
Page 52
The Committee reviews performance and compensation data of the peer group to gain a sense of whether we are providing generally competitive compensation for our named executive officers individually and as a group. For 2018, the nine peer companies are:

These nine U.S.-domiciled companies were selected because they generally market their products through the same types of independent insurance agencies that represent our company, and they provide both commercial lines and personal lines of insurance, as we do. We also included companies in the peer group that historically have followed an equity investment strategy similar to ours, or that offer life insurance products or excess and surplus lines coverages.
Comparative performance and compensation data reviewed by the Committee suggests that the company's executive compensation is not excessive as compared with performance and compensation levels of the peer group. As reported by Equilar, Total Direct Compensation of $14,711,912 awarded to our named executive officers as a group in 2017, the last year for which peer data is available, was approximately 69 percent of the average Total Direct Compensation of $21,374,260 awarded by companies in the peer group to their named executive officers as a group in the same year. The following table ranks the company and the nine companies in the peer group according to market capitalization at December 31, 2018, and ranks three-year value creation ratio, three-year total shareholder returns as of December 31, 2018, as reported by Bloomberg LP, and compensation data compiled by Equilar from the 2018 proxy statements filed by the peer group, the most recent year for which such data is available.

Compensation Consultants 
The Committee does not employ compensation consultants for recommendations concerning executive compensation. Our compensation programs are not complex and, because we do not benchmark compensation to peers, the Committee does not believe it requires the services of a compensation consultant to assist with either administration of current plans or the determination of appropriate levels of compensation. The Committee will continue to monitor our compensation structure to ensure that the compensation it wishes to deliver to the executive team is delivered as appropriate, considering overall company and individual performance. The Committee does review and consider peer group performance and compensation data collected from the Equilar service and publicly available proxy statements and Form 10-K filings. 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) limits to $1 million per year the federal income tax deduction to public corporations for compensation paid in any fiscal year to any individual who is identified as a named executive officer as of the end of the fiscal year in accordance with the Exchange Act. Until the enactment of the Jobs and Tax Reform Act of 2017 (Tax Reform) this limitation did not apply to qualifying "performance-based compensation." The Committee intended that PSUs (which permit the Committee to exercise negative discretion to reduce or eliminate payment of awards) and stock options that are subject to binding agreements in effect before November 2, 2017, to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception to the $1 million limitation under prior law. 
Beginning with grants of performance-based compensation made after November 2, 2017, Tax Reform removes the tax deduction for compensation of our named executive officers in excess of $1 million, even if that compensation results from what previously would have qualified as "performance-based compensation" under 162(m). We believe that performance-based compensation remains an effective incentive to drive short-term and long-term results that benefit our company and its shareholders, and we will continue to use it. We also expect that the overall beneficial effect of Tax Reform on our country's economy, in general and the domestic insurance industry, in particular, and the positive impact that we expect those beneficial effects to have on our company in the future more than outweigh the loss of a tax deduction for executive compensation. 
The Committee generally does not favor the payment of tax gross-ups. Except in limited circumstances, such as a retirement gift of nominal value or relocation assistance on the same basis offered to all retiring or relocating associates, the Committee has not authorized payment of tax gross-ups to executive officers.
Page 54
Employment Agreements, Change in Control Provisions and 
Post-Retirement Benefits
We do not have employment agreements with any of our named executive officers that specify a term of employment or guarantee minimum levels of bonuses or stock-based awards. All of our named executive officers are at-will employees. Our long-standing corporate perspective has been that employment contracts do not provide the company with any significant advantage. We believe our corporate culture, current compensation practices and levels of stock ownership by our executive officers have resulted in stability in our current 14-member group of executive officers, who average 24 years with the company.
In 2011, in connection with hiring Mr. Sewell as our chief financial officer, the Committee authorized a deferred compensation agreement between the company and Mr. Sewell designed to approximate the value of retirement benefits that he would forego at his former employer. Mr. Sewell is fully vested in amounts payable under the agreement. No amounts are payable under the agreement until Mr. Sewell reaches the age of 58.
Change in control provisions are included in our 2016 and 2012 Stock Compensation Plans and our 2009 Annual Incentive Plan, and those provisions apply to all associates receiving awards under the plans, not just to executive officers. The change in control provisions in these plans contain a "double trigger," which requires both a change in control event, as defined in the plans, and termination of the associate's employment due to the change in control within a specified time period. The double trigger ensures that we will become obligated to accelerate vesting of prior awards only if the associate is actually or constructively discharged because of the change in control event. 
We occasionally provide post-retirement benefits to long-tenured, executive-officer-level associates who provide services to the company after retirement from their executive positions. These post-retirement benefits are intended to compensate the associate for ongoing services associated with maintaining continuity of relationships and providing guidance to their successors and other associates. No post-retirement benefits were paid to any former executive officer in 2018.

(1) Since 2010, the Committee has eliminated discretionary cash bonuses as a regular component of compensation for the named executive officers.  
(2) Amounts shown in the Stock Awards column reflect values for grants of PSUs, RSUs and Holiday Stock awards. PSUs were intended to be performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) on the date of grant and reflect the full grant date fair values in accordance with FASB ASC 718. Amounts for PSUs are computed using a Monte Carlo valuation on the date of grant. Amounts for RSUs reflect the full grant date fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 718. These amounts do not represent the actual value that may be realized by the named executive officers. For assumptions used in determining the values for awards of PSUs and RSUs, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8, Note 17, Page 173. Awards under the Holiday Stock Plan are valued at fair market value on the date of grant. The per share fair market values were $81.46, $73.30 and $71.55 for the grant dates of November 9, 2018, November 10, 2017 and November 11, 2016, respectively. There were no forfeitures of Holiday Stock or PSU or RSU awards by the named executive officers in 2018, 2017 or 2016.  
(3) Amounts in the Option Awards column reflect the value of awards for grants of nonqualified stock options. These nonqualified stock options were intended to be performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) on the date of grant and reflect the full grant date fair values in accordance with FASB ASC 718. These amounts do not represent the actual value, if any, that may be realized by the named executive officers. For assumptions used in calculation of option awards, see our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Part II, Item 8, Note 17, Page 173. There were no forfeitures of option awards by the named executive officers in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

[END TABLE]
Total compensation for 2018 shown in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, excluding attributions of compensation related to retirement plans, generally decreased from 2017 levels because of lower payouts of annual incentive compensation; at the threshold level of 30 percent of target for 2018, compared with the maximum level of 200 percent of target for 2017.
Total compensation for 2017 shown in the Summary Compensation Table, excluding attributions of compensation related to retirement plans, generally increased from 2016 levels because of the increased number of nonqualified stock options and RSUs awarded in connection with structural changes made to the executive compensation program to add greater weight to long-term, stock-based compensation.

In February 2018, the Committee adjusted base salaries to $1,030,000 for Mr. Johnston; to $953,424 for Mr. Scherer; to $857,500 for Mr. Sewell; to $715,804 for Mr. Hollenbeck; and to $624,445 for Mr. Mullen.
In February 2017, the Committee adjusted base salaries to $1,000,000 for Mr. Johnston; to $925,654 for Mr. Scherer; to $816,667 for Mr. Sewell; to $681,718 for Mr. Hollenbeck; and to $575,525 for Mr. Mullen.
In February 2016, the Committee adjusted base salaries to $964,451 for Mr. Johnston; to $892,747 for Mr. Scherer; to $787,635 for Mr. Sewell; and to $649,256 for Mr. Hollenbeck.
Amounts shown in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table represent the annual incremental changes in the present values of benefits under the company's defined benefit and SERP plans. Changes in the balances of the Top Hat accounts of named executive officers due to their contributions and investment performance during the year are included in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.

(1) Amounts listed in the "Present Value of Accumulated Benefit" column were calculated as of December 31, 2018, using the same actuarial assumptions used by the company for GAAP financial reporting purposes and assuming that benefits commence at age 65. The assumptions include a lump-sum factor baseline of 0.75 percent for both plans and a discount rate of 4.34 percent in the Qualified Pension Plan and 4.25 percent in the Supplemental Retirement Plan.  
(2) Messrs. Johnston and Sewell joined the company after entry into the qualified pension plan was closed. Mr. Hollenbeck elected to leave the retirement plans in 2008 in connection with changes to the plans. 
(3) At December 31, 2018, Mr. Scherer had reached the normal retirement age under both plans. 
(4) At December 31, 2018, Mr. Mullen had reached the early retirement age under both plans. 
[END TABLE]
Tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan - The Cincinnati Financial Corporation Retirement Plan (Retirement Plan) is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan available to all full-time associates ages 40 and over on August 31, 2008, who elected to remain in the plan effective September 1, 2008. Members who were actively employed by the company on June 30, 2008, became fully vested in their accrued benefit. The Retirement Plan is closed to new members. Members of the Retirement Plan earn one year of service for each calendar year in which they work at least 1,000 hours. Members also earn service for time that they are paid, or entitled to be paid, but do not actually work. These times include vacation, holidays, illness, military duty and some periods of disability. Generally, the maximum amount of service that may be earned under the Retirement Plan is 40 years. There are no deductions for Social Security or other offset amounts. 
The Retirement Plan defines earnings for any given plan year as the base rate of salary in effect on the last day of the plan year, subject to the maximum recognizable compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Bonuses, stock-based awards and other forms of compensation do not contribute to earnings under the Retirement Plan. 
Normal retirement age as defined in the Retirement Plan is age 65. The normal retirement pension is computed as a single life annuity. The normal monthly benefit payment is the greatest of the following three calculated amounts: 
The first calculated amount is the sum of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. 0.45 percent of the member's average monthly earnings plus 1.35 percent of the member's average monthly earnings up to $2,916.67; multiplied by years of service up to 15 years, plus 
2. 0.6 percent of the member's average monthly earnings plus 1.8 percent of the member's average monthly earnings up to $2,916.67; multiplied by years of service between 16 and 40.  
[END TABLE]
Page 63
The second calculated amount is the sum of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. 0.9 percent of the member's final average earnings; multiplied by years of service up to 15 years, plus 
2. 1.2 percent of the member's final average earnings; multiplied by years of service between 16 and 40.  
[END TABLE]
The third calculated amount applies only to employees originally hired by our former subsidiary, Inter-Ocean Insurance Company, and is calculated as 1.0 percent of the member's final average earnings multiplied by years of service not in excess of 50 years. 
The normal form of benefit payment under the terms of the Retirement Plan is a single life annuity for unmarried members and a joint and 50 percent survivor annuity for married members. The plan permits members to elect to receive payment of benefits in the following forms:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Single life only 
• Single life only with 60-month or 120-month guarantee 
• Joint and 50 percent contingent annuity 
• Joint and 66.67 percent contingent annuity 
• Joint and 75 percent contingent annuity 
• Joint and 100 percent contingent annuity 
• Lump sum 
[END TABLE]
Alternative forms of benefit payment are offered to provide plan members some flexibility in retirement income and estate planning by giving them the option of electing monthly benefits with or without a survivor's benefit. Generally, the single life annuity alternative provides the largest monthly benefit but does not provide a survivor's benefit. All other payment forms are the actuarial equivalent of a single life annuity. Alternatives other than the single life annuity provide slightly lower monthly benefits to the plan member, depending on such factors as presence of survivor's benefit, the member's age and any contingent annuitant's age. The lump sum payment permits plan members to roll the present value of their benefit into an Individual Retirement Account and defer income taxes until the member withdraws funds from that account.
Supplemental retirement plan - The second retirement plan in which some named executive officers participate is the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP). The SERP is unfunded and subject to forfeiture in the event of bankruptcy.
The SERP is a nontax-qualified defined benefit plan maintained by the company to pay eligible associates the difference between the amount payable under the tax-qualified defined benefit plan and the amount they would have received without the tax-qualified plan's limit due to Section 401(a)(17) and Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the SERP definitions for service, normal retirement age and annual earnings are the same as those for the Retirement Plan except the SERP's definition of annual earnings is not limited.
The normal retirement benefit under the SERP for the participating named executive officers will be equal to the excess of the member's monthly benefit under the Retirement Plan as of the member's retirement date, without regard to the limit on earnings under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code and without regard to any limit on benefits under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The pension benefit under the SERP is payable only in the form of a single lump sum.
Page 64
Both retirement plans permit early retirement, provided the member has at least five years of service. Benefits for early retirement are calculated by adjusting for life expectancy and reducing the benefit payable at age 65 by 0.5 percent per month for each month prior to age 65 that the member elects to begin receiving pension benefits. For example, a member who elects to retire at age 60 would receive 70 percent (60 months X 0.5 percent = 30 percent reduction) of the life-expectancy adjusted benefit payable at age 65.
Actuarial work related to both the Retirement Plan and SERP is performed by Willis Towers Watson, which provides human resource strategy, design and management; actuarial and management consulting to the financial services industry; and reinsurance intermediary services. The Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to provide actuarial and consultative services related to the design of the company's retirement and employee benefit plans.

[END TABLE]
Defined contribution plans - The company sponsors a tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan for all associates as well as the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Top Hat Savings Plan, a deferred compensation plan for a select group of management or certain highly compensated associates. Fidelity Management Trust Company is the third-party administrator of the company's defined contribution plans. The company made no cash contributions to the 401(k) or Top Hat plans until September 2008. In connection with Retirement Plan changes effective September 1, 2008, the company began to match contributions to the 401(k) plan made by associates who are not members of the Retirement Plan, up to a maximum of 6 percent of the associate's annual cash compensation (salary and annual incentive compensation award). Participants in the Top Hat Savings Plan do not receive a matching contribution from the company unless their compensation level exceeds the maximum recognizable compensation under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, which for 2018 was $275,000. Contributions made by associates immediately vest, while company matching contributions vest after three years of service. Messrs. Johnston, Sewell and Hollenbeck participate in these defined contribution plans and receive company matches of contributions made in each up to the 6 percent maximum. Messrs. Scherer and Mullen also have participated in these plans, but they do not receive the company match because they are participants in the defined benefit Retirement Plan and SERP.
Page 65
Compensation payable to the named executive officers may be deferred pursuant to the Top Hat Savings Plan. Under the Top Hat Savings Plan, highly compensated individuals as defined by the plan, including the named executive officers, may elect to defer a percentage of salary, any discretionary bonus and any annual incentive compensation, less the required withholdings. Deferral elections are made before the plan year for which compensation is to be deferred and are effective for the entire year. These elections generally may not be modified or terminated for that year. Compensation deferred by the named executive officer is credited to the individual's deferred compensation account maintained by the company. 
Beginning in 2008, in connection with the company's redesign of our retirement benefit plans, we amended the Top Hat Savings Plan to eliminate the prior cap on the amount of salary that may be deferred and to permit company matching contributions for certain officers who have contributed to and received the maximum company match allowable in their 401(k) accounts, yet due to tax law limitations, are unable to receive a matching contribution for the compensation that exceeds the limit imposed on tax-qualified 401(k) plans. We do not otherwise contribute to or match contributions to this plan. Participants are prohibited from borrowing or pledging amounts credited to their accounts. Under the defined contribution plans, individuals choose one or more of several specified investment alternatives, including an alternative for Cincinnati Financial Corporation common stock. Earnings credited to the participant's account are calculated based on the performance of the applicable investment choice(s) selected by the participant. We do not guarantee any level of return on contributions to the Top Hat Savings Plan.
Distributions from the Top Hat Savings Plan are made as soon as legally and administratively feasible after retirement, other separation from service or death, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. Distributions to the named executive officers due to retirement or other separation of service are not permitted until the earlier of 180 days after employment terminates or death. Other than distributions pursuant to qualified domestic relations orders, distributions are made in the form of either a single lump-sum payment or monthly installments of not less than 12 months or more than 120 months, depending upon the participant's prior election. To the extent that a participant chooses to have earnings credited based on the Cincinnati Financial Corporation common stock election, the participant may choose to receive any benefit payments in the form of stock. All other distributions are made in cash.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
We do not have employment contracts or severance plans applicable to any of our named executive officers. Assuming a termination of employment on December 31, 2018, amounts the named executive officer would receive are governed by the terms of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plans, our various stock compensation plans and the 2009 Annual Incentive Compensation Plan. Generally, upon termination of employment for any reason, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive the balance of the Top Hat Savings Plan account disclosed in the Aggregated Balance at 2018 Year-End column of the 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan table. Additionally, individual named executive officers would be entitled to receive the amounts set forth in the table below, depending on age and the nature of the termination.

(1) Messrs. Johnston and Sewell were hired after entry into the defined benefit pension plan was closed and, therefore, were never members of the pension plan or the SERP. If either retired due to a disability or terminated employment because of change of control, he would receive accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock-based awards under the 2006, 2012 and 2016 Stock Compensation Plans, plus target levels of any outstanding annual incentive compensation award.  
(2) Mr. Scherer is age 65 and is eligible for normal retirement under the defined benefit pension plan and SERP. For any termination of employment other than a termination due to retirement with disability or change in control, he would receive accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock-based awards under the 2006, 2012 and 2016 Stock Compensation Plans and outstanding annual incentive compensation awards under the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan at levels determined by company performance. For a employment termination due to retirement with disability or change in control, Mr. Scherer would receive accelerated vesting of oustanding PSUs and annual incentive compensation awards at target levels. The amount shown for Mr. Scherer includes threshold values for annual incentive compensation and stock based awards, respectively, for performance periods ending December 31, 2018, and target levels for performance-based stock awards with performance periods ending after December 31, 2018. 
(3) Mr. Hollenbeck elected to leave the defined benefit plan in 2008, in connection with the company's restructuring of its retirement benefits. If he retired due to a disability or terminated employment because of change of control, he would receive accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock-based awards under the 2006, 2012 and 2016 Stock Compensation Plans and outstanding annual incentive compensation awards at levels determined by company performance. For any other termination of employment, he would not receive accelerated vesting of such awards because he has not attained age 65 and has not been employed with the company for 35 years. 
(4) Mr. Mullen is eligible for early retirement under the defined benefit pension plan and SERP. If he retired due to a disability or terminated employment because of change of control, he would receive accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock-based awards under the 2006, 2012 and 2016 Stock Compensation Plans and outstanding awards of annual incentive compensation under the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan at target levels. Because Mr. Mullen has been employed by the company for more than 35 years, for purposes of plan awards, any other termination of employment would be treated as a retirement and he would receive accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock-based awards under the 2006, 2012 and 2016 Stock Compensation Plans and outstanding annual incentive compensation awards under the 2009 Annual Incentive Plan at levels determined by company performance. The amount shown for Mr. Mullen includes threshold values for annual incentive compensation and stock based awards for performance periods ending December 31, 2018, and target levels for performance-based stock awards with performance periods ending after December 31, 2018.

Audit-Related Matters
Proposal 3 - Ratifying the Selection of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit committee has selected the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although action by shareholders in this matter is not required, the audit committee believes that it is appropriate to seek shareholder ratification of this selection and to seriously consider shareholder opinion on this issue.
Representatives from Deloitte & Touche LLP, which also served as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the last calendar year, will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will be afforded the opportunity to make any statements they wish and to answer appropriate questions.
Vote Required
The majority of the votes cast on this proposal is required for approval. Abstentions and broker nonvotes have no effect on the voting for this proposal, but are counted as present for purposes of determining whether quorum requirements are met for the meeting.
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the resolution ratifying the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
Report of the Audit Committee
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the company's consolidated financial statements, the company's system of internal controls, the qualifications and independence of the company's independent registered accounting firm, the performance of the company's internal audit department and independent registered accounting firm and the company's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements. The committee has sole authority and responsibility to select, determine the compensation of, and evaluate the company's independent registered accounting firm. The committee has nine independent directors and operates under a written charter. The board has determined that each committee member is independent under the standards of director independence established by the Nasdaq listing requirements and is also independent for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act.
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls; for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and for the report on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The committee's responsibility is to oversee and review the financial reporting process and to review and discuss management's report on the company's internal control over financial reporting. However, the committee is not professionally engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and does not provide any expert or special assurance as to such financial statements concerning compliance with laws, regulations or generally accepted accounting principles or as to auditor independence. The committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and the independent registered accounting firm.
Page 68
The committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, with management, the internal auditors and Deloitte & Touche LLP. The committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors and Deloitte & Touche LLP the process used to support certifications by the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer that are required by the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to accompany the company's periodic filings with the SEC and the processes used to support management's annual report on the company's internal controls over financial reporting.
The committee also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP matters that independent registered public accounting firms must discuss with audit committees under generally accepted auditing standards and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), including, among other matters, those related to the conduct of the audit of the company's consolidated financial statements and those required to be discussed by AICPA Auditing Standards No. 61, codified into AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU Section 380 and PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 - Communications with Audit Committees, effective pursuant to SEC Release No. 34-68453 (December 17, 2012). The committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable standards of the PCAOB regarding its communications with the committee concerning independence, and the committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence from the company. The committee considered whether services Deloitte & Touche LLP provided to the company beyond those rendered in connection with its audit of the company's consolidated financial statements and its reviews of the company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q were compatible with maintaining its independence. The committee also reviewed, among other things, the audit, audit-related and tax services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP, and the amount of fees paid for such services. The committee received regular updates on the amount of fees and scope of audit, audit-related and tax services provided.
Based on the above-mentioned review and these meetings, discussions and reports, and subject to the limitations on the committee's role and responsibilities referred to above and in the committee's charter, the committee recommended to the board that the company's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The committee also selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent registered accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and is presenting the selection to the shareholders for ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Submitted by the audit committee:
William F. Bahl, Gregory T. Bier, Linda W. Clement-Holmes, Dirk J. Debbink, Kenneth C. Lichtendahl, David P. Osborn, Gretchen W. Price (chair), Douglas S. Skidmore and John F. Steele, Jr.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why are these materials important?
The board of directors of Cincinnati Financial Corporation is soliciting your vote for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2019, may vote. You have one vote for each share of common stock you owned on that date. There were 163,127,889 shares of common stock outstanding as of the close of business on February 28, 2019. A majority of the outstanding shares, or 81,563,945 shares, must be represented to hold the meeting. This constitutes a quorum. 
How do I vote?
You may vote by proxy, whether or not you attend the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we ask that you vote your shares in one of the ways listed below. Attending the meeting does not constitute a revocation of a previously submitted vote. 
A Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials will be provided to you by mail in late March, unless you previously requested for these materials to be delivered to you in paper or by email. The Notice includes instructions for viewing our year-end 2018 financial materials and proxy statement online and for voting via the internet, by telephone or by mail, along with the required Control Number (the Control Number is unique to each account). The Notice also includes instructions on how to request paper materials.
Shareholders who previously requested paper or email delivery of all materials will receive the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the 2019 Annual Letter from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and the 2019 Shareholder Meeting Notice and Proxy Statement in late March or early April.
If you are a Shareholder of Record who owns shares directly in your name, you may vote your shares in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   By telephone. You may vote your shares by calling 1-866-804-9616. 
   Over the internet. Go to AALvote.com/cinf. You will need to have your Control Number available when you access the website. Your Control Number is on the Notice or proxy card that you received in the mail. 
   By scanning the QR code on your proxy card or Notice with your mobile device. The QR code on your proxy card or Notice is a unique identifier so you will not need to enter a Control Number. If you scan the QR code with your mobile device, you will access our proxy materials along with a voting screen. 
   By mail. If you received printed proxy materials, you may submit your vote by completing, signing and dating each proxy card received and returning it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. Be sure to return your proxy card in time to be received and counted before the Annual Meeting. 
   In person at the Annual Meeting. You may vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we recommend that you also submit your proxy card or voting instructions, vote by telephone or via the internet by the applicable deadline so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Page 72
If you vote by telephone or via the internet at AALvote.com/cinf or by scanning the QR code with your mobile device, you must vote no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on April 26, 2019. You do not need to return a proxy card by mail. Voting electronically or by telephone is convenient, reduces the use of natural resources and saves significant postage and processing costs. Your vote is also recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays could cause your vote to arrive late and therefore not be counted.
If you are a Beneficial Shareholder who owns shares indirectly through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions in the Notice or voting instructions that you receive from the broker or other nominee holding your shares. Beneficial Shareholders include current and former company associates who hold shares in the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Savings Plan. The availability of telephone and internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker or nominee. Shares held beneficially may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from your broker or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
How do I locate my Control Number? 
If you receive our information in the mail, the Control Number is on the Notice or proxy card that also indicates your name and the number of shares you own. If you receive our information electronically, the Control Number is in the text of the email. If you are a Shareholder of Record, you may also obtain your Control Number by calling 1-877-777-2857. If you are a Beneficial Shareholder, your bank, broker or other nominee can provide your Control Number. 
Can I obtain another proxy card so I can vote by mail?
If you are a Shareholder of Record, you may obtain another proxy card by calling 1-877-777-2857. If you are a Beneficial Shareholder, your bank, broker or other nominee can supply another voting instruction form.
Can my shares be voted if I don't return my proxy or voting instructions and don't attend the annual meeting? 
If you are a Shareholder of Record, the answer is no. If you are a Beneficial Shareholder and you do not direct your nominee as to how to vote your shares, applicable rules provide that the nominee generally may vote your shares on any of the routine matters scheduled to come before the meeting. The proposal to ratify the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm is believed to be the only routine matter scheduled to come before this year's annual meeting. If your nominee indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular matter, these shares (called broker nonvotes) are counted as present in determining whether we have a quorum but have no effect on the votes required to elect directors or to approve compensation for our named executive officers.
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
Yes. Simply cast a new vote by internet or telephone or send in a new signed proxy card with a later date. If you are a Shareholder of Record, you may send a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of the company. If you hold shares directly in your name and attend the annual meeting, you also may choose to vote in person. At the meeting, you can request a ballot and direct that your previously submitted proxy not be used. 
Page 73
How are the votes counted? 
Votes cast by proxy are tabulated prior to the meeting by the holders of the proxies. Inspectors of election appointed at the meeting count the votes and announce the preliminary results at the meeting. The proxy agent reserves the right not to vote any proxies that are altered in a manner not intended by the instructions contained in the proxy. The company publicly discloses the final voting results in a Form 8-K filing after the vote count is certified, usually within a week of the meeting.
Could other matters be decided at the meeting? 
We do not know of any matters to be considered at the annual meeting other than the election of directors and the proposals described in this proxy statement. For any other matters that do properly come before the meeting, your shares will be voted at the discretion of the proxy holder.
Can I listen to the meeting if I cannot attend in person?
The meeting is open to all interested parties. You can also listen to a live webcast of the meeting if you are unable to attend. Instructions are available at cinfin.com/investors approximately two weeks before the meeting. An audio replay is available on the website within two hours after the close of the meeting.
How can I obtain a 2018 Annual Report? 
You can obtain our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC at no cost in several ways. You may view, search or print the document online from cinfin.com/investors or viewproxy.com/cinfin/2018. You may ask that a copy be mailed to you by contacting the corporate secretary of Cincinnati Financial Corporation. Or, you may request it directly from Shareholder Services. Please see the Investor Contacts page of cinfin.com/investors for details. These contacts are also listed at the end of this proxy statement.

Director Nominations for Inclusion in the Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Shareholder Meeting

Cost of Solicitation
Proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers or other employees, either in person or by mail, telephone or email. The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the company. We have contracted with Alliance Advisors LLC to provide internet and telephone voting service for our direct shareholders of record. We ask banks, brokerage houses, other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward copies of the proxy materials to beneficial owners of shares or to request authority for the execution of proxies; and we have agreed to reimburse reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred. We have retained the services of Alliance Advisors LLC, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist us in soliciting proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The cost of such services is estimated at $12,500 plus out-of-pocket expenses.
Other Business
Management does not know of any other matter or business that may be brought before the meeting; but if any other matter or business properly comes before the meeting, it is intended that a vote will be cast pursuant to the accompanying proxy in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting the same.

Appendix A
Definitions of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP Measures 
(See attached tables for reconciliations; prior-period reconciliations available at cinfin.com/investors.)
Cincinnati Financial Corporation prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data. 
Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.  
[END TABLE]
For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segment plus our reinsurance assumed operations.  
• Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products.

Other Measures

• Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. 
• Statutory accounting rules: For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, insurers also must calculate certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, which may be, and has been, modified by various state insurance departments and differ from GAAP. Statutory data is publicly available, and various organizations use it to calculate aggregate industry data, study industry trends and compare insurance companies.  
• Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules, property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. Earned premium, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is calculated ratably over the policy term. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.
