October 25, 2018 
Dear fellow stockholders, 
The General Finance Corporation team continues to deliver great results in executing our long-term growth strategy. The chart following shows the capital markets rewarding these results, and in fiscal year 2018 our common stock outperformed the Russell 2000 Index and S&P SmallCap 600® Index by a wide margin. 
Over the past decade, our team has consistently managed our business model and driven our growth strategy. We focus on growing our business and branch network with organic growth, recurring leasing revenue, superior customer service, new product innovation, operational excellence and disciplined acquisitions. 
DECADE OF HIGHLIGHTS 
Through our team's dedication and commitment to our long-term growth strategies, the business reached important growth milestones in fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Branch Network Growth. Over the past 11 years ending June 30, 2018 our branch network grew from 15 to 95 branches. 
       Lease Fleet Growth. From June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2018 our lease fleet grew at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. 
       EBITDA Margin Growth. Our EBITDA margins have increased from 17% in June 30, 2007 to 25% at June 30, 2018. 
       Large and Loyal Customer Base. Our customer base has grown from 12,000 customers at June 30, 2007 to over 47,000 customers at June 30, 2018, of which over 80% are repeat leasing customers. 
       Disciplined and Accretive Acquisitions. From May 31, 2007 to June 30, 2018 we completed 48 accretive acquisitions. 
[END TABLE]
LEASE FLEET 
We continue to grow our North America and Asia-Pacific lease fleets with disciplined and balanced capital allocation. In fiscal year 2018 we invested $21 million in net lease fleet purchases to drive organic growth and $87 million to acquire 
 North America and Asia-Pacific container businesses with strong long-term prospects. We also simplified our corporate structure by acquiring all the remaining publicly-traded shares we did not own of our Australian and New Zealand business at an attractive price, making Royal Wolf a wholly-owned subsidiary. 
Our lease fleet grew through this combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with North America lease fleet units increasing by 58%, or 31,553 units from June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2018. The charts below show the long-term growth of our lease fleet and units utilization and the value of our lease fleet. 
OUR PEOPLE AND CUSTOMERS 
Our team continues to deliver outstanding customer service, earning Pac-Van a "net promoter score" of 85, which we believe leads our industry. This high level of customer satisfaction has helped General Finance Corporation build the diverse and loyal customer base shown below. 
LEADERSHIP 
Our Chief Executive Officer, Jody Miller, has completed a flawless transition to his new role. His "lead by example" leadership style has the entire executive team reaching for new heights. 
The balance of our executive and support team, Chuck Barrantes, Jeffrey Kluckman, Chris Wilson and Sally Lierheimer, provide the foundation that support our long-term strategies. Mr. Barrantes adds value with effective communication with our capital providers while mentoring the younger financial executives, and Mr. Kluckman contributes by completing accretive acquisitions and leading a disciplined acquisition process. 
Pac-Van has benefited from the consistent leadership of the management team headed by Ted Mourouzis and Eric Weber. In fiscal year 2018 Mr. Mourouzis and Mr. Weber guided Pac-Van to increased utilization across all product categories and a $7 million increase in core rental revenue over the prior fiscal year. While Royal Wolf, under Neil Littlewood's and Greg Baker's leadership, has continued to deliver solid results in fiscal year 2018 with increases in EBITDA, leasing revenue, sales revenue and utilization over the prior fiscal year. 
Under Bobby Keenom's leadership Lone Star Tank Rental achieved strong fiscal year 2018 results, increasing EBITDA by 211% over fiscal year 2017 and leasing revenue by over $20 million over the prior fiscal year. Southern Frac also rebounded in fiscal year 2018 under Brian Bottelberghe's leadership with sales of 250 frac tanks, specialty tanks and chassis. 
In addition to each of these exceptional leaders, General Finance Corporation is fortunate to have hundreds of employees focused on our strategies and delivering best-in-class service to our customers. 
OUR ANNUAL STOCKHOLDER MEETING 
We appreciate our team of high quality service providers and "customer first" attitude. Our company provides an environment where our people can develop, contribute and prosper. Our long-term growth strategies create the foundation for sustainable long-term value for our stockholders.

PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To be held on Tuesday, December 6, 2018 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Why did you send me the Proxy Materials? 
We sent you the Proxy Materials because you owned shares of common stock ("Common Stock") of General Finance Corporation ("we" or the "Company") at the close of business on October 9, 2018, the record date. The Proxy Materials, which are furnished by the Board, provide you with information that will help you cast your vote at the Annual Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. You do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card. 
You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, which will take place on December 6, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, at 39 East Union Street, Pasadena, California 91103. 
When you return the completed, signed and dated proxy card, you appoint the proxy holders named therein (your proxies), as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. The proxy holders will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them on your proxy card(s). If an issue not set forth on the proxy card comes up for vote at the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares, under your proxy, in accordance with their best judgment. 
We began sending the Proxy Materials on or about October 26, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote. 
We have enclosed with this Proxy Statement, proxy card and Notice of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders our Annual Report to stockholders, which includes our 2018 Annual Report as filed with the SEC. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only stockholders who owned Common Stock at the close of business on October 9, 2018, the record date, are entitled to vote on matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, there were 30,259,966 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The Common Stock is our only class of voting stock outstanding. 
What am I voting on? 
We ask you to vote on the election of three Class C directors, ratification of the selection of Crowe LLP as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, approve an amendment to the Company's bylaws that would result in the courts located within the State of Delaware serving as the exclusive forum for the adjudication of certain legal actions involving the Company and any other matter properly presented at the Annual Meeting. The sections entitled "Election of Directors," "Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors" and "Bylaw Amendment" provide more information on these proposals. 
At the time this Proxy Statement was printed, we knew of no other matters to be acted upon by stockholders at the Annual Meeting.  Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting? 
On the date this Proxy Statement was printed, we did not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those mentioned in this Proxy Statement. If you vote your proxy by following the instructions in this Proxy Statement and other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for a vote of stockholders, the persons appointed as proxies by the Board will have discretion to vote your shares for you.  
How many votes do I have, and who will count the votes? 
You have one vote for each share of our Common Stock you own. Charles E. Barrantes, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Christopher A. Wilson, our General Counsel, Vice President and Secretary, will act as inspectors of the election and will tabulate the votes. 
How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the number of shares present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. (A "broker non-vote" occurs when a beneficial owner fails to provide the broker with instructions on how the vote the shares, and the broker lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares.) Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted either as a vote cast for or against the election of the three Class C directors, the ratification of selection of independent auditors or the amendment of our bylaws. 
How can I vote? 
For Company stockholders of record, the Company has established telephone and Internet voting described below. If your shares of common stock are held in a brokerage account, by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered a "beneficial owner" of those shares, and the availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on the voting processes of your broker, bank or other holder of record. We therefore recommend that you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive. 
You may vote by telephone or via the Internet. You can vote by telephone or via the Internet by following the instructions in your enclosed proxy card, notice and/or voting instruction form. Votes submitted electronically over the Internet or by telephone must be received by 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 5, 2018. You can vote by calling the toll-free telephone number on your proxy card. Please have your proxy card available when you call. The website for Internet voting is www.proxyvote.com. 
You may vote by mail. You can vote by mail by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it promptly in the prepaid envelope provided. If you are a stockholder of record and you did not receive a prepaid envelope, please mail your signed proxy card to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State Street, Floor 30, New York, New York 10275-0741, Attention: Proxy Department. If you mark your voting instructions on the proxy card, your shares will be voted as you instruct. If you return a signed proxy card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted FOR the election of the nominees for director, the ratification of the selection of independent auditors and the amendment of the Company's bylaws identified in this Proxy Statement. 
You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. If you hold your shares as a beneficial owner ("in street name"), you must request a legal proxy from your stockbroker in order to vote at the Annual Meeting. Otherwise, we cannot count your votes. Please see the notice or voting instruction form from your bank, broker or other holder of record for more information on these options.  What is the difference between holding shares of Common Stock as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
If your shares of Common Stock are registered in your name with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, you are a "stockholder of record" of those shares, and the Proxy Materials were sent to you by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. If your shares of common stock are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered a "beneficial owner" of those shares, and Proxy Materials were sent to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record. As the beneficial owner you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by telephone, Internet, by mail or other means.  
May I revoke my proxy? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can change or revoke your proxy before it is exercised by giving written notice to our Secretary or in person at our corporate headquarters before the Annual Meeting that you have revoked your proxy, by delivering in a timely manner a valid proxy by mail, telephone or Internet with a date later than the prior proxy or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other holder of record. All shares for which proxies have been properly submitted and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
How will shares I hold in street name be voted? 
If your shares of Common Stock are held in street name, your broker, bank or other holder of record, under certain circumstances, may not vote your shares without specific voting instructions under rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"). This is called a "broker non-vote." We encourage you to provide instructions to your brokerage firm by voting your proxy. This ensures your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
If you have more than one account at the transfer agent and/or with stockbrokers, you will receive separate proxy cards for each account. Please sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all your shares are voted. 
How many votes may be cast at the Annual Meeting? 
Based on the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date, up to 30,259,966 votes may be cast on any matter. 
How many shares of Common Stock do you need to hold the Annual Meeting (what are the quorum requirements)? 
Shares representing a majority of our outstanding votes on the record date of October 9, 2018 must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, a quorum will be present at the Annual Meeting if 15,129,984 shares of Common Stock are represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker) or if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Who nominates individuals for election to the Board? 
Nominations for the election of individuals to the Board may be made by the Board or by any holder of our Common Stock.  How many votes must the director nominee receive to be elected? 
The nominees receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of the three Class C directors will be elected as the three Class C directors. This number is called a plurality. If you withhold authority to vote for the nominee on your proxy card, your vote will not count either "for" or "against" the nominee. 
How many votes are required to ratify the selection of auditors? 
The selection of Crowe LLP will be ratified if a majority of the votes cast are voted in favor of ratification. 
How many votes are required to approve the amendment to our bylaws?

GOVERNANCE INFORMATION 
Board of Directors 
General Oversight 
The business of the Company is managed under the direction of the Company's Board. The Board's general oversight responsibility is conferred by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Company's Bylaws. The leadership structure of the Board and its committees assist the Board in exercising its fiduciary duties as it oversees the Company's business affairs, Chief Executive Officer performance and succession, internal controls over financial reporting and long-term strategy. 
Leadership Structure 
The Company does not have a formal policy concerning whether the same individual may serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In June 2014, the Board approved a Charter for the Lead Independent Director, elected Ronald F. Valenta as the Chairman of the Board and elected James B. Roszak as the Lead Independent Director. The Charter of Lead Independent Director provides that the Lead Independent Director must be independent and delineates the powers of the Lead Independent Director, including the power to call meetings of the independent Board members, to develop agendas for executive sessions of the Board's independent members and to preside at executive sessions of the Board's independent directors. Ronald F. Valenta retired as the Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2017, and Jody Miller has served as our Chief Executive Officer and President since January 1, 2018. 
Risk Oversight 
The identification, evaluation and mitigation of risks arising in connection with the Company's businesses are the responsibility of the Company's senior management. The Board's responsibility is to understand the risks related to the Company's businesses and to oversee senior management's mitigation of those risks. 
The Board and the Audit Committee receive regular reports from senior management concerning the risks related to the Company's businesses. 
The Audit Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee have certain risk management oversight responsibilities and regularly report to the Board concerning risk management. These reports include   the risks considered by each committee and the direction given to management to mitigate these risks. The Audit Committee oversees compliance by the Company with legal requirements and regularly receives reports concerning the Company's significant internal controls, steps taken by management to maintain a strong internal controls environment and enterprise risk management. In addition, representatives of the Company's independent auditors attend Audit Committee meetings, deliver presentations to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee in private session. The Company's Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel also meet in private session with the Audit Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee develops corporate governance principles and oversees management's evaluation and mitigation of risk relating to the Company's Code of Ethics and business practices. 
Corporate Governance 
Our corporate governance reflects the principles that guide the Company. Our corporate governance framework specifies the duties, responsibilities and rights of our stockholders, Board and management. Our corporate governance principles are found in the Company's charter documents, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Company's Code of Ethics, committee charters and other policies approved by the Board. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines were adopted by the Board in December 2010. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are reviewed at least annually to guide our corporate governance in response to changing regulatory requirements and as circumstances warrant. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Ethics and committee charters are available for review on our website http://www.generalfinance.com/corporate.html or may be requested without charge by written request to our Secretary, General Finance Corporation, 39 East Union Street, Pasadena, California 91103. The information on our website is not part of this Proxy Statement. 
Director Independence 
NASDAQ Stock Market Rules require that a majority of the members of the Board be "independent directors," which is defined generally as a person, other than an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, having no relationship, which, in the opinion of the Company's Board, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. All members of the Board's Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees are "independent" within the meaning of NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(i) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
In making these determinations, the Board was presented with a report from the Company's General Counsel and discussed information provided by the directors and the Company with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they relate to the Company. Each director and executive officer is required to complete a director and officer questionnaire each year which requires disclosure of transactions with the Company in which the director or officer, or any members of his or her family, have a direct or indirect material interest and which requires disclosure of any relationships or transactions which could interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment. 
The Board has determined that Ms. Harris and Messrs. Baribault, Roszak, Tashjian and Trussler are independent under NASDAQ Stock Market rules and listing standards and have no relationship with the Company except as a director and stockholder. The Board determined that Mr. Valenta is not independent because he served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company until December 31, 2017. The Board determined that Mr. Marrero is not independent because he serves as the President of Main St. Personal Finance, Inc., a specialty finance company controlled by Mr. Valenta. The Board determined that Mr. Miller is not independent because he serves as the President and, since December 31, 2017, as the Chief Executive Officer.  Executive Sessions of Independent Directors 
The Company's corporate governance guidelines require independent directors to meet, without management, at regularly scheduled executive sessions which generally may take place after regularly scheduled meetings of the entire Board. The Chairman of the Board, the Lead Independent Director or any two independent directors may call a special executive session of the independent directors at any time. Such special executive sessions may take place after a regular or special meeting of the entire Board or at such other time deemed appropriate. 
Lead Independent Director 
James B. Roszak has served as the Lead Independent Director since June 2014. 
Board and Committee Meetings 
The Board held five meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, or fiscal year 2018, and acted by written consent four times. All five of the meetings were regular meetings. The Board holds meetings each fiscal year according to a pre-arranged schedule, but the Board also holds special meetings and acts by written consent from time to time as needed. 
Each director attended more than 75% of all meetings of the Board and board committees on which he or she served during the period he or she was a director in fiscal year 2018. 
Board Committees 
The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. Each committee regularly delivers reports to the full Board concerning its meetings and actions. In fiscal year 2018 the independent directors met in executive session five times, and the Audit Committee met in executive session in two of its four regularly scheduled meetings. 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee consists of Mr. Roszak, as Chair, Mr. Baribault, Ms. Harris and Mr. Tashjian. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as "independent" within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and Section 10A of the Exchange Act. Our Board has determined that Mr. Roszak, Mr. Baribault and Mr. Tashjian each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ. In addition, Mr. Roszak, Mr. Baribault, Ms. Harris and Mr. Tashjian have the past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in their financial sophistication. 
The functions of the Audit Committee and its activities during fiscal year 2018 are described below under the heading "Report of the Audit Committee." 
The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee within the past year has reviewed and assessed the adequacy of the charter. The Audit Committee charter was most recently amended in September 2016 concerning the Audit Committee's oversight of the internal audit department. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available free of charge on the "Corporate Governance" section in our website at www.generalfinance.com or by written request addressed to our Secretary. 
The Audit Committee met four times in fiscal year 2018. 
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee consists of Ms. Harris, as Chair, Mr. Baribault, Mr. Roszak and Mr. Tashjian, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ rules and listing standards. The purposes of the Compensation Committee are to determine and approve the goals, objectives and compensation structure for our executive officers, to review the performance of our executive officers and to review the Company's management resources, succession planning and development activities.  The Board established the Compensation Committee in May 2006. The Compensation Committee adopted its charter in February 2007. The Compensation Committee reviews its charter annually and recommends to the Board any changes to the charter it believes are warranted. The Compensation Committee amended its charter in June 2011 and October 2013. The October 2013 amendments provided that each member of the Compensation Committee must be "independent" with the meaning of SEC and NASDAQ Stock Market Rules, that committee member independence must be evaluated from a variety of factors, including committee member compensation sources and affiliation with the Company and that the Company's chief executive officer may not be present during voting or deliberations concerning his compensation. The June 2011 amendments to the charter provided that each member of the Compensation Committee must be independent within the meaning of NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(i) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and that prior to selection of an executive compensation advisor, the Compensation Committee must evaluate the independence of the executive compensation advisor by considering the factors identified by the SEC necessary to determine the executive compensation advisors are independent. A copy of the Compensation Committee Charter is available free of charge on the "Corporate Governance" section in our website at www.generalfinance.com or by written request addressed to our Secretary. 
The Compensation Committee met four times in fiscal year 2018. 
Nominating and Governance Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee consists of Mr. Tashjian, as Chairman, Ms. Harris and Mr. Roszak. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for certain matters which include reviewing the size and composition of the Board, overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our Board, maintaining and overseeing the corporate governance of the Company, assuring that the Board conducts an annual self-evaluation and periodically reviewing the Company's succession plans. 
The Board adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee in January 2006 and amended its charter in September 2009. A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter is available free of charge on the "Corporate Governance" section in our website at www.generalfinance.com or by written request addressed to our Secretary. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee met two times in fiscal year 2018. 
Composition of the Board and Review of Director Nominees 
The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically assesses and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the size and composition of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of diverse knowledge, experience and capabilities on the Board. The committee is responsible for identifying and assessing potential director candidates from directors, management and stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee recommends qualified candidates to the Board. 
Stockholders' nominees for director must be delivered to the Company in writing and include the written consent of and background information concerning the nominee sufficient for the Nominating and Governance Committee to evaluate the candidate's qualifications. Stockholder nominees for director must be delivered pursuant to all of the requirements described in the paragraphs below and the section of this Proxy Statement entitled "Stockholder Recommendations for Board Nominees." When considering candidates for director, the Nominating and Governance Committee takes into account a number of factors, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ethics and integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ability to attend regular and special board and committee meetings and willingness to perform the duties of a  director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Excellent moral character and reputation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Industry knowledge, contacts and network of potential clients in industries served by the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ability to be responsible and fair-minded;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prior experience, including service on boards of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior-level management experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the candidate has a background that would provide diversity to the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Possession of specific skills in auditing, accounting, personnel and finance.  
[END TABLE]
Candidates need not possess all of these characteristics, nor are all of these factors weighed equally. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically determines whether any vacancies on the Board are expected. If vacancies are anticipated or arise, or the size of the Board expands, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider potential candidates for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the Board through current Board members or management, stockholders or other persons. These candidates will be evaluated at regular or special meetings of the Nominating and Governance Committee and may be considered at any point during the year. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider candidates for directors recommended by stockholders who follow the proper procedures in submitting the recommendation. The Board will consider candidates recommended by stockholders using the same criteria it applies to candidates recommended by directors. To be considered for election at an annual meeting, the recommendation must be submitted no later than November 5, 2018. The recommendation must be in writing and addressed to the Secretary and must include the following: (i) a statement that the writer is a stockholder and is proposing a candidate for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee; (ii) the name and contact information for the candidate; (iii) a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience; (iv) information regarding each of the factors listed above (other than the factor regarding board size and composition) sufficient to enable the Nominating and Governance Committee to evaluate the candidate; (v) a statement detailing any relationship between the candidate and any competitor of the Company; (vi) detailed information about any relationship or understanding between the writer and the candidate; and (vii) a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and is willing to serve as a director if nominated and elected. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No person who served on the Compensation Committee in fiscal year 2018 was, during the year or previously, an officer or employee of the Company or had a relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Since July 2011 Mr. Marrero has served as the President of Main St. Personal Finance, Inc., a company controlled by Ronald F. Valenta. Mr. Valenta has the power to set Mr. Marrero's incentive compensation. No other interlocking relationship exists between any member of the Board and any member of any other company's board of directors or compensation committee. 
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Company has not adopted a formal written policy regarding transactions with related persons. The Company's Code of Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees ("Code of Ethics") requires the disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest. Delaware law in turn requires that each director or officer disclose to the Board all material facts relating to such director's or officer's relationship or interest in a proposed contract or transaction and that a majority of the Board, with any interested director abstaining, approve the contract or transaction in good faith. 
The Board is responsible for reviewing any proposed transaction with related persons. The Board considers all relevant information in deciding whether to approve or reject a transaction with a related person. Information   relating to transactions between the Company and related persons is set forth in "Transactions with Related Parties." 
Communication with the Board Directors 
Stockholders may communicate with the Board in writing by mail delivered to the following address: General Finance Corporation, 39 East Union Street, Pasadena, California 91103, Attention: Secretary. All notices and communications received in writing will be distributed to the Chairman of the Board, the Lead Independent Director and, if applicable, the chairman or chair of the appropriate Board committee. 
Code of Ethics 
The Company's Code of Ethics applies to all our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The Code of Ethics sets forth the guiding principles by which the Board, officers and employees operate the Company's businesses. The Code of Ethics is posted on our Internet website at www.generalfinance.com under the "Corporate Governance" section. 
We will provide a copy of the Code of Ethics upon written request delivered to General Finance Corporation, 39 East Union Street, Pasadena, California 91103, Attention: Secretary.

As of October 9, 2018, each non-employee director owned more Company common stock than is required by the Company's stock ownership guidelines. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
We have scheduled a board meeting in conjunction with our Annual Meeting and expect that our directors will attend, absent a valid business or personal reason not to attend.  PROPOSAL 1: 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
(Item Number 1 on the Proxy Card) 
Background 
Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board must consist of no less than three members, the exact number of which is determined from time to time by the Board, divided into three classes designated Class A, Class B and Class C, respectively. As of the Annual Meeting, the number of directors will be fixed at eight. 
The terms of the Class A directors will expire as of the annual meeting of stockholders in 2019, the terms of the Class B directors will expire as of the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and the terms of the Class C directors will expire as of the annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. Upon expiration of the terms of the directors of each class as set forth above, the terms of their successors in that class will continue until the end of their terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
The Board has nominated three Class C directors, William H. Baribault, Larry D. Tashjian and Ronald F. Valenta for re-election by the stockholders. If a nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve, your proxy holders may vote for another nominee proposed by the Board.

If you do not vote for a nominee, or you withhold authority to vote for the nominee on your proxy card, your vote will not count either "for" or "against" the nominee. 
The persons appointed by the Board as proxies intend to vote for the election of the Director nominees, unless you indicate otherwise on the proxy or voting instruction card. 
Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE BOARD NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL 2: 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
(Item Number 2 on the Proxy Card) 
Background 
The Audit Committee has selected Crowe LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, or fiscal year 2019. We are asking the stockholders to ratify this selection. We expect a representative from Crowe LLP to participate in the Annual Meeting and the representative will have the opportunity to make a statement if desired and to respond to appropriate questions by stockholders. 
Aggregate fees billed to us by Crowe LLP for professional services rendered with respect to our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, or fiscal year 2017, and our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, or fiscal year 2018, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 708,357      $ 683,522   
 Audit-Related Fees      249,974        209,250   
 Tax Fees      —          —     
 All Other Fees      —          —     
[END TABLE]
In the above table, in accordance with the SEC's definitions and rules, "audit fees" are fees we paid for professional services for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, including those in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and local statutory audit requirements and reviews of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. "Audit-related fees" are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. "Tax fees" are fees for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. 
The policy of the Audit Committee is that it must approve in advance all services (audit and non-audit) to be rendered by the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee approved in advance the engagement of Crowe LLP for services in fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018. 
Vote Required 
The ratification of the selection of Crowe LLP requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the number of shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions will be counted as if voted "against" this proposal. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection, the adverse vote will be deemed to be an indication to the Audit Committee that it should consider selecting other independent auditors for fiscal year 2019. Because of the difficulty and expense of substituting accounting firms, it is the intention of the Audit Committee that the appointment of Crowe LLP for fiscal year 2019 will stand unless, for a reason other than the adverse vote of the stockholders, the Audit Committee deems it necessary or appropriate to make a change. The Audit Committee also retains the power to appoint another independent auditor at any time or from time to time if it determines it is in our best interests. 
Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF CROWE LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  PROPOSAL 3: 
ADOPTION OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS 
TO PROVIDE THAT THE COURTS LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL SERVE AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF CERTAIN LEGAL DISPUTES 
We are asking stockholders to approve an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") that, if adopted, would result in the courts located within the State of Delaware serving as the exclusive forum for the adjudication of certain legal actions involving the Company. If is approved by stockholders, the Bylaws will be amended to insert a new provision as Section 15 of Article 5 to the Bylaws. The text of the new Section 15 of Article 5 to the Bylaws is as follows: 
EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR ADJUDICATION OF DISPUTES 
"Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (v) any action or proceeding asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants." 
The Board has the power to adopt this Bylaw Amendment by vote of the Board. The Board is seeking stockholder approval, however, for this exclusive forum bylaw Amendment based on the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board's belief that such provision is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board's own determination that approval by the Company's stockholders should be sought because of  the importance of this issue.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that this exclusive forum bylaw is in the best interests of its stockholders based on the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The rising volume of multi—forum litigation exposes the Company to expensive and potentially contradictory  litigation outcomes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Bylaw Amendment would eliminate the risk of plaintiffs filing the same lawsuit in the courts of multiple  jurisdictions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Delaware Court of Chancery can resolve stockholder litigation on an accelerated schedule compared to other  jurisdictions; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chancellors of the Delaware Court of Chancery have significant experience and expertise in corporate law.   
[END TABLE]
The Board is concerned by the continuing trend of stockholder litigation driven by and benefiting lawyers relating to mergers and acquisitions and other matters submitted for stockholder approval. Such stockholder litigation can be filed where a company has its headquarters or where one or more of the plaintiff stockholders   reside, rather than the state where a company is incorporated. The filing of litigation in states other than the state where a company was incorporated can result in courts that are unfamiliar with the laws of company's state of incorporation being required to interpret and apply those laws. 
The Board believes that designating the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for litigation against the Company, the directors and officers of the Company and the other matters described in the Bylaw Amendment will benefit the Company's stockholders by placing the resolution of that litigation with courts which are the most familiar and experienced with Delaware law, the law under which the Company was incorporated. 
The Board also believes that Company's stockholders will also benefit from by Bylaw Amendment by avoiding the rising tide of lawyer–driven litigation that involves the same facts and that is filed in multiple states to gain advantage and increase the Company's legal fees and expenses. The Board also believes that Company stockholders will benefit by avoiding conflicting and contradictory litigation outcomes. 
Based on the foregoing the Board believes that the Amendment is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders and recommends that its stockholders approve the Amendment. If approved by stockholders, the Amendment will be immediately effective. If the Amendment is not approved the Board will reconsider whether the Amendment is in the best interests of Company and its stockholders and consider further action. 
Voting Thresholds 
Stockholder approval is not required for the Board to amend our bylaws. The Board believes however, that submitting this proposal to stockholder vote is in keeping with our commitment to seek stockholder input for important governance issues and to serve the best interests of our stockholders. Approval of the Amendment requires the affirmative "FOR" vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions are treated as shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have the same effect as a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non—votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the amendment to our Bylaws establishing the courts located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive form for the adjudication of today certain legal disputes.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein. 
The Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the unaudited financial statements included with Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee met and discussed with management and the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed under the rules and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). These discussions included the clarity of the disclosures made therein, the underlying estimates and assumptions used in the financial reporting, the reasonableness of the significant judgments and management decisions made in developing the financial statements and the testing and evaluation of the system of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors their independence from the Company and has received the written letter required by the PCAOB from the independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee also met and discussed with the independent auditors the overall scope and objectives of the audit, the Company's critical accounting policies and the specific results of the audit. Management was present at all or some part of each of these meetings. 
Pursuant to the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
Management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including its system of internal controls, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. It is neither the Committee's duty nor responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. Members of the Audit Committee are not employees of the Company and may not be, and do not represent themselves to be or to serve as, accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing. Therefore, members have relied, without independent verification, on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and on the representations of the independent auditors included in their report on the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee's oversight does not provide it with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, consultations and discussions with management and the independent auditors do not assure that the Company's financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or that the Company's independent accountants are in fact "independent."

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Overview of Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis reviews the Company's executive compensation program for fiscal year 2018. 
The Company's executive compensation program aligns the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. The Company's executive compensation program does so by establishing short-term and long-term and strategic goals to increase stockholder value and by rewarding the achievement by executive officers of those goals. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and makes recommendations with respect to the adoption and implementation of equity-based and non-equity based compensation plans for executive officers. We therefore structure the compensation of our executive officers to reward the achievement of the strategic goals that drive stockholder value. 
Say-on-Pay and Frequency of Say-on Pay Advisory Votes 
The Company held its initial advisory vote on executive compensation at its December 2013 annual stockholder meeting at which time a non-binding, advisory vote on executive compensation was approved with approximately 98.6% of the stockholders who voted on the proposal approving the compensation of our named executive officers. At the same December 2013 annual meeting of stockholders, we held our first advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The Company's stockholders voted to hold triennial votes on executive compensation. 
At our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders we held our second advisory vote on executive compensation and our second advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The 2016 non-binding, advisory vote on executive compensation was approved with approximately 99.2% of the stockholders who voted on the proposal approving the compensation of our named executive officers. The Company's stockholders voted to hold a triennial vote on executive compensation.  Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for the establishment and development of the Company's compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee establishes, implements and monitors the structure of the Company's executive compensation program. 
The Compensation Committee designs the executive compensation program to achieve the following key goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforce the business strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Balance rewards that address both short-term and long-term strategic objectives;  
[END TABLE]

• Motivate executives to deliver a high degree of business performance without encouraging unnecessary risk taking;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executives' interests with the stockholders' interests; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain talented executives whose skills and achievements will increase stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determines the structure and amount of all executive officer compensation, including grants of equity and non-equity compensation, after receiving recommendations from management and input from its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC. 
The Compensation Committee believes the structure and implementation of the executive compensation program in fiscal year 2018 implemented its compensation philosophies. Each executive's fiscal year plan consists of financial incentives based upon the achievement of EBITDA targets and individualized key performance indicators. In fiscal year 2018 EBITDA-based targets constituted a meaningful portion of each executive's incentive plan: 40% of the potential annual bonus for our chief executive officer, 48.3% of the potential bonus for our chief financial officer, 40% of the potential annual bonus of our executive vice president of global business development and 35.6% of the potential annual bonus of our chief executive officer of Royal Wolf Holdings Limited ("Royal Wolf") were based upon achieving EBITDA targets. The remaining non-equity, performance-based incentive compensation for these executives was based on the attainment of key performance indicators created for each executive. The Compensation Committee believes this compensation program structure focuses the executive team on increasing revenues and profitability, a key element of the Company's business strategy. 
The Compensation established key performance indicators in fiscal year 2018 for our chief executive officer that reinforced our business strategy. Other non-financial objectives of performance-based incentive compensation of our chief executive officer and president included de-levering the Company's balance sheet, mentoring and training members of the senior management team, completing a smooth transition to chief executive officer, attending investor conferences and earnings conference calls, overseeing the information technology consolidation plan, reducing stale inventory and implementing an enterprise financial management system. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation plans of Lone Star Tank Rental Inc. ("Lone Star"), Pac-Van, Inc. ("Pac-Van"), Royal Wolf and Southern Frac, LLC ("Southern Frac"), and the risks taken by their respective management teams to meet compensation plan goals, do not vary significantly between the four businesses. 
The Compensation Committee also believes that compensation plans and practices of the Company, Lone Star, Pac-Van, Royal Wolf Holdings and Southern Frac do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. For fiscal year 2018, non-equity, performance-based compensation goals established by the Compensation Committee were based upon a variety of metrics, which include EBITDA, and key performance indicators. These objectives and metrics require executives to consider a variety of operating results in pursuing their compensation goals. The Compensation Committee believes that the structure of the non-equity, performance-based compensation emphasizes long-term results, thereby reducing the risk that executives would take undue risk to achieve short-term goals. The Compensation Committee therefore believes the structure of the compensation plans for annual bonuses and the vesting of equity awards stock do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Elements of Compensation. 
For the fiscal year 2018, the principal components of compensation for the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the other three most highly compensated executive officers, or collectively the named executive officers, were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Annual base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Non-equity performance-based annual incentive compensation; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Long-term equity incentive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salaries. Annual base salaries provide executive officers with a minimum level of cash compensation. We establish base salaries at levels so that a significant portion of the total cash compensation such executives can earn is performance-based (through annual incentive compensation). Base salaries are set based on factors, as applicable, that include whether a salary level is competitive with comparable companies, the recommendations of Mr. Miller for the other named executive officers and the business judgment of the members of the Compensation Committee, as discussed further below. 
Bonuses. Annual cash bonuses are designed to reward our executive officers, including each of the named executive officers and certain employees, for achievement of financial and operational goals and individual performance objectives to enable us to meet long and short-term goals. In fiscal year 2018 the objectives related to financial metrics, such as EBITDA goals, and the achievement of other corporate, operational and financial goals. These goals and bonuses are determined annually at the discretion of the Compensation Committee in consultation with Mr. Miller. 
Equity-Based Compensation. Equity awards of stock options and restricted stock are long-term incentives designed to reward long-term growth in the stockholder value. Stock option and restricted stock awards assist in the retention of executives because they are not exercisable at the time of grant and achieve their maximum value only if vesting conditions, which include performance goals and continued employment are met. Stock options have value solely to the extent that the price of our common stock increases over the exercise price set as of the date of grant. The Compensation Committee believes that our executive officers should have an incentive to improve the Company's performance by having an ongoing stake in the success of our business. The Compensation Committee seeks to create this incentive by granting executive officers stock options and restricted stock. 
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Grant Practices 
Grants of stock options and restricted stock to all of our executive officers and other employees, including the named executive officers, must be approved by the Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. Grants occur only at meetings of the Compensation Committee and such grants are made effective as of the date of the meeting or a future date, as in the case of the hiring of a new employee. Awards of stock options and restricted stock are not timed in coordination with the release of material non-public information. The exercise price of all stock options and restricted stock granted is equal to the closing market price of our common shares on the date of grant so that the executive officer may not profit from the option unless the price of our common shares increases. 
The Compensation Committee determines stock option and restricted stock award levels in their discretion, primarily based on the recommendations of Mr. Miller, consideration of the importance of an individual's responsibilities and performance within the Company and equity awards at comparable companies. 
Options and restricted stock granted by the Compensation Committee also are designed to help us retain executive officers in that options and restricted stock are not exercisable at the time of grant and achieve their maximum value only if performance criteria are met or if the executive remains in the Company's employ for a   period of years. All options and restricted stock granted to executive officers and employees in fiscal year 2018 vest ratably over three years based on continued employment. The Compensation Committee believes that these vesting arrangements align the interests of option holders with stockholders by emphasizing a long-term view of building stockholder value. The Compensation Committee also believes that multi-year vesting reduces the risks that could arise from undertaking initiatives to realize annual EBITDA goals, such as through acquisitions or capital expenditures, that could attain short-term goals while adversely effecting long-term stockholder value. 
Grants of stock options and restricted stock under the 2009 Plan and the 2014 Plan are subject to the recoupment provisions included in each plan which require each option holder to forfeit all or any portion of an option grant and to reimburse the Company for all proceeds received from exercising stock options and restricted stock if (i) payment, grant or vesting was predicated on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a material financial misstatement, (ii) the Board determines the award recipients engaged in fraud or misconduct that caused or partially caused the material financial restatement of the Company or any affiliate and (iii)  a lower payment, award or vesting would have occurred based on the financial results. 
Role of Executive Officers. 
In general, Mr. Miller attends all meetings of the Compensation Committee at which compensation of the other named executive officers or compensation policy is reviewed other than when his compensation is being discussed. Mr. Miller does not vote on items before the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and the Board solicit Mr. Miller's views on the performance of the executive officers who report to him. 
Compensation Surveys. 
Each component of compensation we pay to our named executive officers—salary, cash bonuses, stock options and restricted stock—is based generally on the Committee's assessment of each individual's role and responsibilities. Consideration of market rates is an additional factor reviewed by the Committee in determining compensation levels. The Compensation Committee engaged Semler Brossy in fiscal year 2015 as its compensation consultants to analyze the Company's compensation program, to provide a benchmarking analysis which compared the Company's compensation program to industry peers and comparable companies and to assist with the design and implementation of the Company's compensation program. 
The Compensation Committee also bases its payment of base salary and annual bonuses for named executive officers, other than the chief executive officer, on the attainment of objectives established by the Compensation Committee and based upon recommendations from Mr. Valenta. In establishing individual bonuses for senior executives, the Compensation Committee considers growth in the enterprise value, common stock price, EBITDA and other financial and corporate objectives, together with the executive officer's contribution to the Company's growth and profitability. 
Compensation of Executives 
The Compensation Committee sets the base salaries, bonus and equity compensation for the named executive officers after consideration of benchmarking and other analyses from Semler Brossy, its independent compensation consultant, and recommendations prepared by Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller used information relating to each executive officer's responsibilities and achievements in accomplishing the corporate objectives set by the Compensation Committee for the previous year, his assessment of the individual performance of each named executive officer and to recommend to the Compensation Committee the annual incentive bonuses for each of the other named executive officers. 
The implementation of the executive compensation program underlined our commitment to pay for performance. Executives who achieved annual, long-term and strategic goals received compensation in accordance with their compensation plans, while executives who failed to achieve their goals received compensation corresponding to their performance.  In June 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the Company's fiscal year 2018 revenues and EBITDA and the recommendations of Mr. Miller with respect to the individual performance of the other named executive officers and the payment of bonuses for fiscal year 2018. The Company exceeded its EBITDA goal for fiscal year 2018 by a considerable margin. The Compensation Committee considered the completion by the named executive officers of certain strategic and operational initiatives during fiscal year 2018 in awarding bonuses for fiscal year 2018. 
Based on the review of the Compensation Committee and the consideration of Mr. Miller's recommendations, the Compensation Committee awarded the following bonuses to the named executive officers for fiscal year 2018. 
The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Valenta achieved all of his fiscal year 2018 key performance indicators, including the successful transition to a new chief executive officer, assisting the new chief executive officer with capital allocation matters, traveling to field operations, reducing senior indebtedness, updating the Company's strategic plan and completing the acquisition of Royal Wolf's publicly traded shares not owned by the Company. Based upon these achievements, the Compensation Committee determine that Mr. Valenta should receive 100% of his target bonus amount. 
The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Miller exceeded his EBITDA goals and achieved all of his fiscal year 2018 key performance indicators, and the Compensation Committee therefore determined to pay Mr. Miller 255.8% of his EBITDA target, or $255,800, 100% of the target for reducing senior indebtedness or $25,000 and 100% of his key performance indicators, or $125,000. The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Barrantes exceeded his EBITDA goals and achieved all of his fiscal year 2018 key performance indicators, and the Compensation Committee therefore determined to pay Mr. Barrantes 194.1% of his EBITDA target, or $135,900, and 90% of his key performance indicators, or $67,500. The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Kluckman exceeded his EBITDA goals and achieved all of his fiscal year 2018 key performance indicators, and the Compensation Committee therefore determined to pay Mr. Kluckman 231.8% of his EBITDA target, or $115,900, 100% of his key performance indicators, or $73,500, and $25,000 for facilitating an acquisition by Royal Wolf. The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Littlewood did not meet his EBITDA goals and achieved some of his fiscal year 2018 key performance indicators, and the Compensation Committee therefore determined to pay Mr. Littlewood 29.3% of his EBITDA target, or A$114,000, and 25% of his key performance indicators, or A$19,0000. 
The executive compensation program therefore reflected the Company's compensation philosophies by reducing executive compensation when the Company's business goals were not met. 
In June 2017, after consultation with Mr. Miller, the Compensation Committee increased the base salaries of some of the named executive officers. Effective in February 2018, Mr. Kluckman's annual base salary was increased by 6.4% to $250,000, and effective July 1, 2018 the annual base salaries of Mr. Miller and Mr. Barrantes were increased by 19.4% and 7.1%, respectively. 
Neither the Committee nor Mr. Miller believe that the fiscal year 2018 goals will require the named executive officers to take risks to achieve their EBITDA goals that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Severance 
Pursuant to separate employment agreements with Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes and Mr. Kluckman, we will make severance payments equal to one year's salary if such person's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the employee for good cause, each as defined in their respective employment agreements. Pursuant to employment agreements with Mr. Littlewood, we will make a severance payment equal to six months' salary, respectively, if his employment is terminated by Royal Wolf without cause or by the employee for good cause, each as defined in their respective employment agreements.  Each of these five employment agreements provide that each executive may be terminated for cause, and the Company or Royal Wolf, as applicable, would therefore not be required to pay severance equal to six months' salary or one year's salary, as applicable, if such executive breaches his employment agreement, commits any act of personal dishonesty, fraud or breach of fiduciary duty or trust, is convicted of or pleads guilty or no contest to any theft, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or crime involving moral turpitude or felony, committed acts which give rise to liability for discrimination or harassment, violates directions from the Board or chief executive officer, acts in a manner that harms the reputation of the Company, is found liable of violating securities or other laws, fails to advance or cooperate with any investigation by the Company or misrepresents his experience or employment history. 
Each of Mr. Valenta, Mr. Barrantes, Miller and Kluckman may terminate their employment for good reason and receive severance equal to one year's salary if the Company reduces their base salary, permanently relocates their place of employment more than 40 miles from their current residence, hires a person to perform the job functions currently performed by such executive or assigns such executive duties beneath the duties they ordinarily perform. 
We may also elect to pay six months' compensation to Mr. Littlewood in lieu of providing six months' prior notice of termination of his employment. 
Clawback Policy 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank, the Compensation Committee has adopted recoupment provisions in the Company's 2009 Plan, 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2014 Restated Plan and in equity award agreements. The Compensation Committee will adopt an amended clawback policy once the SEC has adopted final rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Except for an expense allowance of $25,000 per year for Mr. Valenta, a car allowance of $650 per month for Mr. Miller and a monthly stipend of $450 for Mr. Kluckman, we do not have programs in place to provide personal perquisites for our executive officers. Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes and Mr. Kluckman participate in the medical and dental insurance of Lone Star or Pac-Van at the expense of the Company. Messrs. Valenta, Mr. Barrantes, Miller and Kluckman are also eligible to participate in the 401(k) retirement plan of Pac-Van, Inc. Mr. Littlewood participates in the medical and dental insurance of Royal Wolf, and Royal Wolf contributed to Mr. Allan's retirement plan and contributes to Mr. Littlewood's retirement plan as required by Australian law. We do not have any other retirement plans under which our executive officers may participate. 
Tax & Accounting Considerations 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation—Code Section 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a $1,000,000 limit on the annual deduction that may be claimed for compensation paid to each of the chief executive officer and the three other highest paid employees of a publicly held corporation (other than the chief financial officer). However, while the Compensation Committee considers the tax deductibility of compensation, the Committee has and may approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility in circumstances it deems appropriate to promote varying corporate goals. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. For the issuances of stock options, the Company follows the fair value provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires recognition of employee share-based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date. For a discussion of valuation assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts for fiscal year 2018, see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," and Note 9, "Equity Plans," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2018 Annual Report filed with the SEC on September 7, 2018.

The employment agreement provides that Mr. Littlewood would be paid an annual base salary of A $475,000 (including superannuation contributions), an annual discretionary bonus targeted at 40% of the annual base salary and long-term incentives in each fiscal year targeted at 40% of the annual base salary.

The employment agreements of Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes and Mr. Kluckman will terminate upon the date of their death or in the event of a physical or mental disability that renders either of them unable to perform his duties for 60 consecutive days or 120 days in any twelve-month period.

In approving the compensation of Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes, Mr. Littlewood and Mr. Kluckman, the Board of Directors reviewed information provided by management regarding the compensation of comparable level officers of public companies, including companies in the equipment leasing   business. The Board also considered the size of the Company, the experience and prior compensation of Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes, Mr. Littlewood and Mr. Kluckman, and the scope of the services that each would be required to render (particularly given the lack of support staff and the need to implement policies and procedures). 
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
The employment agreements of Mr. Valenta, Mr. Miller, Mr. Barrantes and Mr. Kluckman provide that each is entitled to a lump sum severance payment of twelve months base salary if we terminate their employment without "cause" or he terminates his employment for "good reason." There is no similar obligation to Mr. Littlewood under his employment agreements following a change of control.  2018 CEO TO MEDIAN EMPLOYEE PAY RATIO 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Company to determine the ratio of the annual total compensation (under the Summary Compensation Table definition) of Company's Chief Executive Officer to that of the Company's median employee. In the identification of our median employee we used June 30, 2018 as our determination date. As of the determination date, the Company had 936 employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer. For purposes of identifying the median employee we included in the calculation of compensation: base salary, stock-based compensation (based on the grant date fair value of awards granted in 2018), target bonus amounts, estimated annual commissions and estimated overtime. We ranked our full employee population from the highest paid to the lowest paid, and the employee at the midpoint is our median employee. 
The total compensation for the median employee was then calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of SEC Regulation S-K. Annual total compensation for Mr. Miller, the Company's Chief Executive Officer was $1,082,585, which was approximately 24 times the median employee compensation of $45,881.37. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.  TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Effective January 31, 2008, we entered into a lease with an affiliate of Ronald F. Valenta, then Chief Executive Officer (now Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors), for our corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. The rent is $7,393 per month, effective March 1, 2009, plus allocated charges for common area maintenance, real property taxes and insurance, for approximately 3,000 square feet of office space. The term of the lease is five years, with two five-year renewal options, and the rent is adjusted yearly based on the consumer price index. On October 11, 2012, we exercised the first option to renew the lease for an additional five-year term commencing February 1, 2013 and on August 7, 2017, exercised the second option for an additional five-year term commencing on February 1, 2018. Rental payments were $110,000 in FY 2016, $113,000 in FY 2017 and $112,000 in FY 2018. 
The premises of Pac-Van's Las Vegas branch are owned by and were leased from the then acting branch manager through December 31, 2016. From January 1, 2017 through May 12, 2017, the use of the premises was rented on a month-to-month basis. Effective May 12, 2017, we entered into a lease agreement through December 31, 2020 for rental of $10,876 per month and the right to extend the term of the lease for three two-year options, with the monthly rental increasing at each option period from $11,420 to $12,590 per month. Rental payments on these premises totaled $118,000 in FY 2016, $124,000 in FY 2017 and $131,000 in FY 2018. 
We have not adopted a formal written policy regarding transactions with related persons. However, in general, any such material transaction would require approval of the Board, with any interested director abstaining.  STOCKHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS
