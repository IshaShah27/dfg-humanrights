Dear Fellow WestRock Company Stockholders: 
We invite you to join us on February 1, 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia for WestRock's annual meeting of stockholders. Please review the enclosed notice of annual meeting and proxy statement carefully as you vote your shares for this year's meeting. 
2018 was a record setting year for WestRock. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth, we increased our sales by 10% to $16.3 billion – the highest sales level in our history. Through improved operating performance, we increased our net cash provided by operating activities by 27% and our segment EBITDA by 28%. Our strategy leverages the broadest portfolio of differentiated paper and packaging solutions in the industry to optimize our business across our system and to grow our sales with customers that value our unique solutions. Our 2018 financial performance suggests that we are successfully executing this strategy. I am very proud of our team members for delivering these impressive results. 
When we completed the merger of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco in 2015, we set an ambitious goal to realize $1 billion in synergy and performance improvements by the end of fiscal 2018. We achieved this goal one quarter earlier than initially expected. This accomplishment demonstrates that our culture of continuous improvement, innovation and execution is driving improved financial results and delivering long-term value for our stockholders. 
In 2018, we used our financial strength to invest in our business to promote long-term value creation for our stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We deployed $348 million to strategic acquisitions and investments, primarily including the  acquisitions of Plymouth Packaging and its "box on demand" system, which has helped us to better serve the growing e-commerce market, and Schlüter Print Pharma Packaging, which has increased our  exposure to the pharmaceutical market and expanded the geographic scope of our Consumer Packaging segment in Europe.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures, including $179 million towards strategic  capital projects, including projects to install a new paper machine at our mill in Florence, South Carolina, to install a new curtain coater at our mill in Cottonton, Alabama and to build a new box plant in Brazil. These multi-year investments will  enable us to more efficiently operate our business and better serve our customers.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, after investing in our business, we returned $636 million to our stockholders, including $441 million in dividends and $195 million in share repurchases. We recently increased our annualized dividend for the third successive year since forming WestRock. The increase to $1.82 per share represented a 5.8% increase over our prior dividend. 
In November, we completed the approximately $4.8 billion acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation. KapStone is a great fit with WestRock. Its complementary corrugated packaging and distribution operations enhance our ability to serve customers across our system, particularly in the western United States, and the addition of KapStone's specialty kraft paper products enhances our differentiated portfolio of paper and packaging solutions. I am thrilled about the addition of KapStone and confident that the acquisition will make WestRock an even better company. 
The strength and continuity of our Board has been instrumental in the development of our business strategy, repositioning our business portfolio and realizing significant synergies and business improvements from the merger of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco. I thank our directors for their guidance and contributions. We welcomed a new director to the Board in 2018. Colleen Arnold was appointed to the Board in July. Her appointment demonstrates the Board's commitment to refreshment with independent nominees who possess the perspective and experience to promote our long-term business strategy. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors and our 50,000 team members around the world, thank you for your investment in WestRock. 
Very truly yours, 
Steven C. Voorhees, Chief Executive Officer and President

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
On November 2, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of January 28, 2018, among WRKCo Inc. (formerly known as WestRock Company) ("WRKCo"), KapStone, WestRock Company (formerly known as Whiskey Holdco, Inc.) ("we", "us", the "Company" or "WestRock"), Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc. and Kola Merger Sub, Inc., the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of KapStone through a transaction in which: (i) Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into WRKCo, with WRKCo surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "WestRock Merger") and (ii) Kola Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into KapStone, with KapStone surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "KapStone Merger" and, together with the WestRock Merger, the "Mergers"). As a result of the Mergers, among other things, (1) the Company became the ultimate parent of WRKCo, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries, (2) each share of WRKCo common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was converted into a share of WestRock common stock, par value $0.01 per share (WRKCo common stock and WestRock common stock are each referred to herein as "Common Stock") and (3) equity awards of WRKCo were converted into equivalent equity awards of WestRock. Effective as of the effective time of the Mergers, the Company changed its name to "WestRock Company" and WRKCo changed its name to "WRKCo Inc." 
The shares of both WRKCo common stock and KapStone common stock were suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") prior to the open of trading on November 5, 2018. Shares of Company common stock continued regular-way trading on the NYSE using WRKCo's trading history under the ticker symbol "WRK" immediately following the suspension of trading of WRKCo common stock. Since the Mergers closed after the September 30, 2018 fiscal year end, the historical financial results referred to in this Proxy Statement reflect the results of WRKCo for periods prior to the Mergers and do not reflect the Mergers or include any results of KapStone. 
The Company is the successor issuer to both WRKCo and KapStone pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). As a result of the Mergers and subsequent Form 15 filings, WRKCo and KapStone are no longer subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. As disclosed in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (the "Form 10-K), in order to provide continuity of information to investors and to meet the Company's obligations pursuant to Rule 12b-3(g) under the Exchange Act, the Form 10-K filed by the Company under the Company's new CIK code was also a complete annual report on Form 10-K of the Company's predecessor registrant WRKCo with respect to WRKCo's last full fiscal year (the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018) prior to the Mergers and contained all of the information that would have been required had WRKCO itself filed an annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 prior to filing the Form 15 suspending its reporting obligations. As specified in the Form 10-K, this Proxy Statement contains the information required by Part III of Form 10-K that the Form 10-K incorporated by reference to this Proxy Statement in accordance with Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K.

 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 
We completed the combination of the Rock-Tenn Company and MeadWestvaco Corporation businesses (the "Combination") in 2015. The Combination created a company with leadership positions in the global consumer and corrugated packaging markets. 
Since completing the Combination, we have executed a number of transactions to focus our asset portfolio on paper-based packaging solutions. These transactions have allowed us to:

Board Refreshment 
We recognize the importance of board refreshment. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee") engaged a consultant in 2017 to support its board refreshment processes and, in July 2018, Colleen Arnold was appointed to the Board. The appointment of Ms. Arnold demonstrates the Board's commitment to refreshment with independent nominees possessing the right perspectives and experience to promote our near- and long-term business strategy. Ms. Arnold brings a wealth of valuable and relevant experience to WestRock, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    International experience  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    Experience leading an organization with significant scale  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    Strong sales and technology experience.  
[END TABLE]
We recently amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Guidelines") to further institutionalize board refreshment within our corporate governance framework. To ensure that the Board continues to evolve in a manner that serves our changing business and strategic needs, going forward the Governance Committee will evaluate whether incumbent directors collectively possess the requisite skills and perspective before recommending a slate of incumbent directors for re-nomination. These evaluations are conducted annually, with discussions about Board refreshment held on an ongoing basis. 
Stockholder Engagement 
Stockholder engagement remains a key pillar of our corporate governance framework. We conduct stockholder outreach throughout the year to ensure management and the Board understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders. We provide regular updates regarding our performance and strategic actions to the investor community, and we participate in numerous investor conferences, one-on-one meetings, earnings calls and educational investor and analyst conversations. We also communicate with stockholders and other stakeholders through various media, including our annual report and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), proxy statements, news releases and our website. We believe ongoing stockholder engagement allows us to respond effectively to stockholder concerns. 
We hosted an "Investor Day" in December 2017. Approximately 100 analysts and investors attended in person. We took the opportunity to, among other things:

 COMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS 
Pay for Performance 
Our executive compensation program is based on a pay-for-performance model. For fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    100% of our named executive officers' ("NEOs") short-term incentive goals were tied to  Company, segment or unit performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    80% of our NEOs' long-term incentive award value was tied to Company performance   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    Achieved 102% of the consolidated EBITDA component of our short-term incentive program because actual  results exceeded target performance levels, resulting in a payout of 114%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  g    Achieved 89% of the productivity component of our short-term incentive program because actual results  fell short of target performance levels, resulting in a payout of 64%  
[END TABLE]
Pay at Risk 
A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is tied to performance. This allocation of variable target direct compensation aligns with our compensation philosophy of motivating our executive officers to achieve our business objectives in the short term and to grow our business to create long-term value for our stockholders.

BOARD COMPOSITION 
The Board consists of 13 directors, six of whom previously served on the RockTenn board of directors prior to the Combination, six of whom previously served on the MeadWestvaco board of directors prior to the Combination and one director (Ms. Arnold) nominated for election to the Board who has not previously stood for election to the Board by our stockholders. 
We believe that the strength and continuity of the Board has been instrumental in the development of our business strategy, repositioning our business portfolio and realizing significant synergies and business improvements from the Combination.  Director Independence 
Under the Guidelines and the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE (the "NYSE Standards"), the Board must consist of a majority of independent directors. The Board annually reviews director independence under standards set forth in the Guidelines. The Board has affirmatively determined that all director nominees, other than Messrs. Luke and Voorhees, are independent. Mr. Luke is not independent because he was an employee of MeadWestvaco immediately prior to the effective date of the Combination. Mr. Voorhees is not independent because he is an employee of WestRock. 
In the normal course of business, we purchase products and services from many suppliers and we sell products and services to many customers. In some cases, these transactions occur with companies with which Board members have relationships as directors or executive officers. Board members also have relationships as directors or executive officers with companies that hold or held our securities. For example, the Board considered the amount of payments received by us from McCormick & Company in the last three years (Mr. Wilson served as an executive officer of McCormick in the last three years) and a lease of office space for Bradley Currey, the retired chairman and CEO of RockTenn and the father of Board member Russell Currey. The Board determined these relationships were not material (individually or collectively) for purposes of its affirmative determinations of director independence. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending candidates for the Board. After completing its evaluation of candidates, the Governance Committee presents its recommendations to the Board for consideration and approval.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Governance Committee periodically  assesses the Board to ensure that it has the right mix of experience, qualifications and skills. To facilitate these assessments, the Governance Committee has developed a matrix to assess each director's level of experience in certain areas  that we consider important in light of our current business strategy and structure. A list of the skills and experiences appearing in the matrix most recently used by the Governance Committee, along with an indication of how many of the director  nominees possess each particular skill or experience, appears on page 9. The directors' biographies (beginning on page 10) note each director's relevant experience, qualifications and skills.   The Governance Committee also periodically assesses the  appropriate size of the Board and any vacancies on the Board that are expected due to retirement or otherwise.

The Board does not have a specific diversity policy. The Board strives to select candidates for Board membership who represent a mix of diverse experience, background and thought at policy-making levels that are relevant to our activities, as well as other characteristics that will contribute to the overall ability of the Board to perform its duties and meet changing conditions. 
Board Refreshment 
We recognize the importance of Board refreshment being evaluated on an ongoing basis in the context of our business strategy. The Governance Committee regularly considers the composition of the Board and how its members change over time. In fiscal 2017, the Governance Committee engaged a consultant to provide advisory services related to board refreshment. The consultant interviewed all then current-directors to capture their perspectives on the composition and culture of the Board, and to seek their views on the skills and experience needed on the Board in the coming years. In July 2018, the Board announced the appointment of Colleen Arnold. 
The Board has established a retirement age for directors. Directors must retire when they reach age 72, provided a director may continue to serve until the next annual or special meeting of stockholders at which the director is to be elected after he or she reaches age 72 and, on an exceptional basis, the Board may extend a director's term for a limited period of time. 
The Board has not established term limits because it believes that, on balance, term limits would sacrifice the contribution of directors who have been able to develop increasing insight into our strategy and operations over a period of time. However, the Governance Committee evaluates the qualifications and performance of each incumbent director before recommending his or her nomination for an additional term. Also, a director who has a significant change in full-time job responsibilities must submit a letter of resignation resigning from the Board, which allows the Board to review the continued appropriateness of the director's membership on the Board under the circumstances. 
We recently amended our Guidelines to further institutionalize board refreshment within our corporate governance framework. To ensure that the Board continues to evolve in a manner that serves our changing business and strategic needs, going forward the Governance Committee will evaluate whether incumbent directors collectively possess the requisite skills and perspective before recommending a slate of incumbent directors for re-nomination. Succession Planning 
The Board is responsible for overseeing and annually reviewing leadership development and assessment initiatives, as well as short- and long-term succession plans for our CEO and senior management. As part of an ongoing leadership succession planning process and working closely with our CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer, the Board regularly reviews our talent strategy to ensure that it supports our business strategy. Succession plans for executive officers are reviewed by the Board at least annually, and successor candidates are identified with input from the CEO. 
In fiscal 2018, the Board used the annual talent evaluation process established by the Governance Committee to oversee CEO succession planning. This process includes reviewing our internal talent pipeline and external benchmarking. As part of this process, the CEO meets annually in executive session with the full Board to review our internal talent pipeline. 
Majority Voting Standard in Uncontested Elections 
Our directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast for them in uncontested elections. If a director does not receive a greater number of "for" votes than "against" votes, then the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Board then determines whether to accept the resignation. Our directors are elected by a plurality vote standard in contested elections. 
Over-Boarding Policy 
Our directors may not serve on more than four other public company boards, and a director who serves as a CEO must limit his or her other public company directorships to two. None of our director nominees serves on more than three other public company boards. 
Director Nominees 
After evaluating each director and the composition of the Board, the Governance Committee recommended all of the current directors for election. If elected, each of the 13 nominees will hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Each nominee has agreed to serve as a director if elected. If for some unforeseen reason a nominee becomes unwilling or unable to serve, proxies will be voted as recommended by the Board to elect substitute nominees recommended by the Board or the Board may allow the vacancy created to remain open until such time as it is filled by the Board, or the Board may determine not to elect substitute nominees and may instead determine to reduce the size of the Board. 
Information about the nominees, including information concerning their qualifications for office, is set forth below.

 BOARD OPERATIONS 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Bylaws separate the roles of CEO and Non-Executive Chairman. Mr. Voorhees serves as our president and CEO. In this role, he has general supervision of our business and affairs, and he is recognized as our leader by business partners, employees, stockholders and other parties. Mr. Luke serves as our Non-Executive Chairman. In this role, he provides oversight, direction and leadership to the Board, and facilitates communication among directors and the regular flow of information between management and directors. In addition, the Non-Executive Chairman: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serves as the Chair of the Executive Committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presides during Board and stockholder meetings  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provides input to the Compensation Committee and Governance Committee, as appropriate, with respect  to the CEO performance evaluation process, the annual Board performance self-evaluation process and Board succession planning.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Nevels serves as our Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director is selected from among the directors and serves a one-year term, and no director may serve more than two consecutive terms, unless the Board determines otherwise. The Lead Independent Director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presides during all meetings of the Board at which the  Non-Executive Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• May call meetings of the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serves as a liaison between the Non-Executive Chairman and  the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If requested by a major stockholder, ensures he or she is available for consultation and direct  communication.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes this leadership structure is the most effective for us at this time because it allows our CEO to focus on running our business and combines a strong Non-Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director to pursue sound governance practices that benefit the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
Stockholder Engagement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Stockholder engagement remains a key  pillar of our corporate governance framework. We conduct stockholder outreach throughout the year to ensure management and the Board understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders. We provide regular updates regarding our  performance and strategic actions to the investor community, and we participate in numerous investor conferences, one-on-one meetings, earnings calls and educational  investor and analyst conversations. We also communicate with stockholders and other stakeholders through various media, including our annual report and SEC filings, proxy statements, news releases and our website. We believe ongoing engagement with  our stockholders allows us to respond effectively to stockholder concerns.   In fiscal 2018, we engaged a third party to conduct interviews of several large stockholders in order to better understand the  perceptions of WestRock among the investor community and we are using the insights derived from these interviews to tailor our outreach efforts.                Governance Highlight   We hosted an "Investor Day" in December 2017. Approximately 100 analysts and investors attended in person. We took the opportunity to,  among other things, focus on our differentiated business strategy, showcase the depth and talent of our management team and identify long-term financial performance targets.

Meeting Attendance 
In fiscal 2018, the Board held ten meetings and committees of the Board held a total of 22 meetings. Overall attendance at these meetings was approximately 95%, and each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during fiscal 2018. All of our current directors attended the annual meeting of stockholders held on February 2, 2018. 
Meetings of Non-Management Directors and Independent Directors 
Our non-management directors meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions in connection with each Board meeting. These meetings are conducted without the presence of management directors or executive officers, unless the non-management directors request the attendance of one or more members of management. At least once a year, and at such other times as may be scheduled by the Non-Executive Chairman or the Lead Independent Director, the independent directors meet separately from the other directors in executive session. 
Evaluations 
The Board and each standing committee conducts an annual self-evaluation. The Governance Committee oversees the process and implementation of these self-evaluations. The Governance Committee assesses the process of conducting self-evaluations annually and has used a variety of methods, including written questionnaires, interviews and group discussions. In fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Non-Executive Chairman and the Chair of the Governance  Committee conducted one-on-one interviews with each individual director to assess the performance of the Board committees and individual directors

 Director Orientation and Continuing Education 
New directors participate in an orientation program and receive materials and briefings to acquaint the director with our business, strategies and policies. Following her appointment to the Board in July 2018, Ms. Arnold met with certain of our senior executives to learn more about our business. She also received copies of our governance and strategy-related documents. 
Continuing education is provided for all directors through board materials and presentations (including by outside speakers), discussions with management, visits to our facilities and other sources. In fiscal 2018:

Risk Oversight 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Board provides oversight of our risk management processes. The Board executes its risk oversight function  both as a whole and through delegation to its key committees, each of which meets regularly and reports back to the Board. Each key committee's risk oversight responsibilities are summarized below.   While the Board and its committees oversee risk  management, management is charged with managing enterprise risks. The Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor desirable to eliminate all risk. Rather, the Board views appropriate risk taking as essential to our long-term success and seeks  to understand and oversee critical business risks in the context of our business strategy, the magnitude of the particular risks and the proper allocation of our risk management and mitigation resources.   We have a robust internal control environment that  facilitates the identification and management of risks and regular communications with the Board. Our internal audit department conducts a companywide risk assessment that includes interviews and surveys to identify and assess the highest impact  risks. The Board and its committees receive regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to us, including operational, financial, strategic, competitive, reputational, legal and regulatory risks, and how those risks  are managed. Our general counsel informs each committee and the Board of relevant legal and compliance issues, and each committee has access to outside counsel when it deems it advisable. Each committee also has the authority to engage independent  counsel at our expense as it deems necessary to carry out its duties and responsibilities.

Given the potential risks  associated with cybersecurity, the Audit Committee received updates from our chief information officer on this topic at each regularly scheduled meeting during fiscal 2018.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the overall compensation strategy and policies for our non-employee directors and for recommending to the Board the compensation of non-employee directors. Directors who also serve as employees do not receive payment for service as directors. 
In making decisions concerning compensation for non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee considers the director compensation practices of peer companies and whether the recommendations align with the interests of our stockholders. We seek to align total non-employee director compensation with the approximate median of peer group total director compensation. 
In fiscal 2018, the compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee analyzed the competitive position of our director compensation program against the peer group used for executive compensation purposes and examined how each element of our director compensation program compared to those for members of the peer group. The compensation consultant's assessment focused on, among other areas, board size and composition, and frequency of meetings; board and committee compensation practices and levels; and total compensation for similarly situated non-employee directors. In addition, the assessment considered certain principles and leading practices identified by the National Association of Corporate Directors. Based on this assessment and in order to more closely align our pay levels to the peer group median, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board a $5,000 increase in the annual equity award component of director compensation, as well as a $1,500 increase in the retainer paid to the Chair of the Compensation Committee and a $2,500 increase in the retainer paid to the Chair of each of the Governance Committee and Finance Committee. The Board considered and then approved these recommendations. 
Compensation for non-employee directors in fiscal 2018 was comprised of the following components:

[END TABLE]
 The amounts reported in the Fees Earned or Paid in Cash column reflect the cash fees earned by each non-employee director in fiscal 2018, whether or not such fees were deferred. These fees were paid in connection with the annual cash retainer, the annual Non-Executive Chairman's fee, the annual Lead Independent Director's fee and each Committee Chair annual fee. Ms. Arnold joined the Board in July 2018 and, in fiscal 2018, received one-quarter of the annual cash retainer. 
The amounts reported in the Stock Awards column reflect the grant date fair value associated with stock awards made in fiscal 2018, calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718. Our non-employee directors (other than Ms. Arnold) received their annual stock award on February 2, 2018. Each non-employee director received 2,008 restricted shares of Common Stock or restricted stock units (for directors who elected to defer their equity awards pursuant to the WestRock Company 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Deferred Compensation Plan")). See "— Deferred Compensation." The number of shares and units associated with this award was determined by dividing the value of the annual stock award by the closing price of Common Stock as reported on the NYSE on the grant date. Upon Ms. Arnold's appointment to the Board on July 26, 2018, she received a stock award of 1,197 restricted shares of Common Stock approximately equal to one-half of the value of the annual stock award received by other non-employee directors on February 2, 2018. Both the stock award received by Ms. Arnold and the annual stock award received by the other non-employee directors vests on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
Deferred Compensation 
Non-employee directors may elect annually to defer all of their cash compensation and/or equity award pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. At the director's option, we credit his or her (i) cash deferred account with the cash compensation he or she elected to defer and (ii) stock unit account for each restricted share of Common Stock that he or she elected to defer. The rights of the director in the balance credited to his or her deferred cash account are vested at all times, whereas rights in the balance of the stock unit account vest in accordance with the vesting schedule for the related restricted Common Stock grants. During fiscal 2018, Messrs. Campbell, Powers and Wilson and Ms. Martore deferred both their cash compensation and equity award, and Ms. Whyte deferred only her equity award. 
Director Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements 
Each non-employee director is required to own at least the greater of (i) 5,000 shares of Common Stock or (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock having a value of not less than five times the annual cash retainer. In determining compliance with these guidelines, stock ownership includes vested and unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Directors have five years from the date of their initial election to achieve the targeted level of ownership. 
All non-employee directors have either achieved the targeted level of ownership or joined the Board within the last five years. 
Our non-employee directors are required to retain 50% of the restricted stock, net of any shares used to satisfy any related tax liability upon vesting, awarded to the individual for a period of two years following the vesting of the restricted stock, or until the individual no longer serves as a director. The retention period does not apply to any shares to the extent the recipient continues to own an amount of Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares required under the preceding sentence, plus a number of shares required to be held under our stock ownership guidelines. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
We require that each executive officer, director and director nominee complete an annual questionnaire and report all transactions since the beginning of the last fiscal year that exceed $120,000 in which we were a participant and in which those persons (or their associates or immediate family members) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Management reviews responses to the questionnaires and, if any such transactions are disclosed, the Governance Committee then makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the appropriateness of such transactions. We do not have a formal written policy for approval or ratification of these transactions. Information included in directors' responses to the questionnaires is reviewed annually by the Board for the purpose of assessing independence under the Guidelines, applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE Standards, and we review all responses to ensure that any such transactions adhere to the standards set forth above as well as our various codes of conduct. There has not been a transaction during fiscal 2018, and there are no currently proposed transactions, in which we were or are to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and an executive officer, director, director nominee, a beneficial owner of five percent or more of our Common Stock (or any immediate family members of such persons) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with directors (i) by mail at WestRock Company, 1000 Abernathy Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30328 or (ii) by facsimile at (770) 263-4402.

On November 2, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Kapstone. As part of this transaction, pursuant to Section 251(g) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), WRKCo (formerly known as WestRock Company) merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Whiskey Holdco, Inc. (now the Company) with WRKCo surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
As was required by Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the current Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of WRKCo (the "WRKCo Charter") contains provisions identical to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the exceptions of the corporate name and that the WRKCo Charter provides that any act or transaction by or involving WRKCo, other than the election or removal of directors, that requires the approval of WRKCo's stockholders (i.e. the Company) will also require the approval of the Company's stockholders by the same vote as is required by the DGCL and the WRKCo Charter (the "Pass-Through Provision"). Absent a provision like the Pass-Through Provision, there is no general requirement under Delaware law that stockholders of a parent entity approve acts or transactions by or involving the parent entity's wholly owned subsidiaries. 
The Pass-Through Provision permits stockholders of the Company, a public holding company, to have direct voting rights as to certain matters affecting the Company's subsidiary, WRKCo, that would otherwise only require the approval of the Company, as WRKCo's sole stockholder. This is highly unusual for a public holding company and restricts the Company's flexibility to manage efficiently and effectively its organization under the existing holding company. For example, the Pass-Through Provision would require WRKCo to obtain approval from the Company's stockholders (in addition to obtaining the approval of its sole stockholder, the Company) prior to making amendments to the WRKCo Charter and certain provisions of the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of WRKCo. The Pass-Through Provision would also require the Company to seek approval from both the Company and the Company's stockholders prior to taking certain intercompany actions, such as a merger of WRKCo with another wholly owned subsidiary of WRKCo. Furthermore, under the DGCL and pursuant to the Pass-Through Provision in WRKCo's Charter, certain corporate acts, such as a conversion from a corporation into a limited liability company (which can facilitate intercompany transactions), would require the unanimous approval of all of the Company's stockholders, in addition to the approval of the Company as the sole stockholder of WRKCo. Obtaining unanimous consent from all of a public corporation's stockholders would be both impractical and unrealistic. Moreover, even for matters not requiring a unanimous vote, scheduling such a vote, whether at a regular annual stockholders meeting or at a special meeting, would delay the completion of the desirable actions and add to their cost. In order to avoid such delay and cost, and to provide maximum flexibility and efficiency under the existing holding company structure, the Company proposes to eliminate the Pass-Through Provision from the WRKCo Charter. 
Following the removal of the Pass-Through Provision from the WRKCo Charter, stockholders of the Company will continue to have the voting rights provided to stockholders of a corporation by applicable law. Removing the Pass-Through Provision from the WRKCo Charter would have no effect on the right of stockholders of the Company to vote on matters relating to the Company, such as a merger or consolidation of the Company, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation, or any other acts or transactions requiring the approval of the Company's stockholders under applicable law. 
The Pass-Through Provision that would be eliminated from the WRKCo Charter by the proposed amendment reads as follows: 
Article X 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Incorporation, any act or transaction by or involving the Corporation, other than the election or removal of directors, that requires for its adoption under the DGCL or the organizational documents of the Corporation the approval of the stockholders of the Corporation shall, pursuant to subsection 7(i)(A) of Section 251(g) of the DGCL, require, in addition, the approval of the stockholders of WestRock Company (or any successor by merger), by the same vote as is required by the DGCL and/or by the organizational documents of the Corporation.  The Board believes that the removal of the Pass-Through Provision will provide the Company with the flexibility to manage its organization under the holding company structure more efficiently and effectively. The Board therefore seeks approval from the Company's stockholders to amend the WRKCo Charter in order to remove the Pass-Through Provision. 
A complete copy of the proposed amendment is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.  COMPENSATION MATTERS

In accordance with SEC rules, our stockholders are being asked to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Last year, more than 98% of the votes cast were in favor of approving the compensation of our NEOs. 
Pay-For-Performance 
In many ways, fiscal 2018 was a record setting year for WestRock. For example, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased our sales by 10% to $16.3 billion – the highest sales level in our history   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased our net cash provided by operating activities by 27%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased our segment EBITDA by 28%.  
[END TABLE]
At the same time, the trading price of our Common Stock fell from $56.73 at the end of fiscal 2017 to $53.44 at the end of fiscal 2018. We believe that the trading price of our Common Stock has been adversely affected by concerns about announcements by certain of our competitors of planned capacity increases in the North American containerboard market. Notwithstanding these impacts, our aggregate total stockholder returns for the past ten, five and three years were 258%, 33% and 26%, respectively. 
We maintain a long-term focus when developing our compensation policies and procedures. As described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 25, we believe our compensation policies and procedures are competitive, focused on pay-for-performance principles and strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our executive compensation philosophy is based on the belief that the compensation of our employees, including our NEOs, should be set at levels that allow us to attract and retain employees who are committed to achieving high performance and who demonstrate the ability to do so. Our objectives include creating a clear path between realized compensation and the successful execution of our business strategy and enhancing each individual executive's performance. We seek to provide an executive compensation package that is driven by our overall financial performance, increased stockholder value, the success of areas of our business directly impacted by the executive's performance and the performance of the individual executive. We view our compensation program as a strategic tool that supports the successful execution of our business strategy. 
Our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018 reflects our commitment to pay-for-performance.

Restoration Award to Mr. Voorhees 
As disclosed in our 2017 proxy statement and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2017, and as discussed in greater detail on page 36 under the heading "Restoration Award to Mr. Voorhees", in February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an award to Mr. Voorhees in order to restore the value to him of returned shares, forfeited shares and cash that he received in respect of fiscal 2014 and 2015 in excess of applicable stock plan limits. Although SEC rules require us to report the value of this award in the summary compensation table of this proxy statement, the award was granted only to ensure Mr. Voorhees received the full amount of the compensation he was granted for his services in fiscal 2014 and 2015. We have therefore included an additional column in our summary compensation table showing Mr. Voorhees' total 2018 compensation, excluding the value of the restoration award, to show the compensation that was actually granted to Mr. Voorhees for his services in fiscal 2018. 
Resolution 
We believe that our executive compensation program has been instrumental in helping us to achieve our strong historical financial performance, and that the emphasis of the program on pay-for-performance has benefited the Company and our stockholders. The advisory vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, it relates to the overall compensation of our NEOs, as well as the compensation philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Our stockholders have the opportunity to vote for or against, or to abstain from voting on, the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers determined by the compensation committee, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosure) in this Proxy Statement. 
Because the required vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. The Compensation Committee will, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 This section explains our compensation philosophy, summarizes our executive compensation programs and discusses  compensation decisions for our NEOs.    EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY   We view our executive compensation program as a  strategic tool that supports the successful execution of our business strategy.

[END TABLE]
We view our executive compensation program as a strategic tool that supports the successful execution of our business strategy. For fiscal 2018, our business strategy continued to focus on generating EBITDA and free cash flow, and realizing synergy and productivity improvements. Our STI program placed substantial weight on achieving consolidated EBITDA, segment EBITDA, unit EBITDA and productivity goals – for example, 100% of the goals for our CEO and CFO were based on the achievement of consolidated EBITDA and productivity goals. Similarly, our LTI program placed substantial weight on generating cash flow – 50% of LTI award value was based on a cash flow per share measure. See "– Compensation Elements – Annual Performance Bonus (STI) – Performance Goals" and "– Compensation Elements – Long-Term Incentives (LTI) – Performance-Based Restricted Stock" for more information. 
For fiscal 2018, the target levels for the consolidated EBITDA and synergies and performance improvements components of our STI program were $2,895 million and $268 million, respectively. In fiscal 2018, we generated consolidated EBITDA of $2,956 million and realized $239 million of year-over-year productivity improvements. We achieved 102% of target for the awards tied to consolidated EBITDA because our actual results exceeded target performance levels, and we achieved 89% of target for the awards tied to productivity because our actual results fell short of target performance levels. For the awards tied to Integrated NA Corrugated EBITDA, we achieved 108% of target, reflecting the superior results delivered by this business in 2018. For the awards tied to Integrated Consumer EBITDA, we achieved 94% of target. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
Philosophy and Objectives 
Our executive compensation philosophy is based on the belief that the compensation of our employees, including our NEOs, should be set at levels that allow us to attract and retain employees who are committed to achieving high performance and who demonstrate the ability to do so. We seek to provide an executive compensation package that is driven by our overall financial performance, increased stockholder value, the success of areas of our business directly impacted by the executive's performance and the executive's leadership. Core principles of our executive compensation program include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overall compensation must be competitive relative to other comparable organizations in order to  attract and retain superior executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A substantial portion of target total direct compensation should be linked to variable, at-risk pay.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LTI should be used in addition to STI to encourage a focus on long-term strategy and execution.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation should reflect an employee's level of responsibility and contribution, and the  greater the responsibility, the greater the share of an employee's compensation that should be at-risk with respect to performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity compensation should be used in addition to cash compensation to align our executives' and  stockholders' interests.  
[END TABLE]
 Pay-for-Performance 
Our executive compensation program is based on a pay-for-performance model. In fiscal 2018, 100% of our NEOs' STI goals and 80% of our NEOs' LTI award value were tied to Company, segment or unit performance. 
The Compensation Committee structures our NEOs' compensation such that a significant portion is at risk. This allocation of variable target direct compensation aligns with our compensation philosophy of motivating our executive officers to achieve our business objectives in the short term and to grow our business to create long-term value for our stockholders. In fiscal 2018, approximately 89% of targeted total direct compensation for our CEO was at risk, and only 11% of his compensation was fixed, ensuring a strong link between his targeted total direct compensation and our financial and operating results. An average of approximately 76% of targeted total direct compensation for the other NEOs was at risk in fiscal 2018.

Effectiveness 
Our aggregate total stockholder returns for the past ten, five and three years were 258%, 33% and 26%, respectively. We believe our executive compensation program has been instrumental in helping us to achieve the strong historical financial performance that has driven these returns.

ADMINISTRATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Benchmarking   The Compensation Committee reviews competitive market data from a combination of a specific peer group of companies within the paper and packaging  industry, as well as other industries, and various published survey data for similarly sized companies or business units in the "non-durable goods manufacturing" sector. In some cases, these surveys  include "all manufacturing" or "general industry" data, when non-durable goods manufacturing categories are not available.   For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee selected a peer group based on  the recommendation of its compensation consultant, which considered factors such as size as measured by revenue, nature of business, talent market, organizational complexity and location. Compared to the fiscal 2017 peer group, the fiscal 2018 peer  group included PPG Industries Inc., Avery Dennison Corp. and LyondellBasell Industries NV – which were added to expand the peer group sample size and bring its median revenue into better alignment with our revenue – and excluded Sealed Air  Corporation and Alcoa, Inc. – which were removed due to a lack of alignment from a revenue perspective and a lack of fit following a spin-off transaction completed by Alcoa, respectively.   The Compensation Committee uses the competitive market data regarding base  salary, STI and LTI to evaluate overall compensation levels in light of practices at companies that we compete with for talent, and seeks to ensure that compensation levels do not deviate significantly from the market median, but does not target a  specific level of compensation.

• Base salary — Salaries are determined based on the executive's responsibilities,  performance, experience and the Compensation Committee's judgment regarding competitive requirements and internal equity. Salaries are individually determined and range broadly among our senior executives.

While the Compensation Committee reviews competitive market data regarding the various components of compensation for each NEO and certain other executives, the primary data point used to assess executive compensation is target total direct compensation. Target total direct compensation is comprised of target total cash compensation (base salary and target STI opportunity), plus target LTI award value. The Compensation Committee has a bias to deliver more performance-based pay, particularly LTI, to deliver competitive pay. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has sole discretion to retain and obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, and is directly responsible for the appointment, termination, compensation and oversight of the work of the compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee retains a compensation consultant to provide objective analysis, advice and information (including competitive market data and compensation recommendations) to the Compensation Committee. The compensation consultant reports to the Chair of the Compensation Committee and has direct access to other Compensation Committee members. The compensation consultant attends all significant meetings of the Compensation Committee and meets with the Compensation Committee in person in executive sessions without management present. 
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Korn Ferry Hay Group ("Korn Ferry") to serve as its compensation consultant through August 2018, at which time the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"). The Committee engaged Meridian after completing a request for proposal involving multiple firms. In connection with engaging both Korn Ferry and Meridian, the Compensation Committee requested and received letters from each firm addressing its independence in light of the standards embodied in SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. The Compensation Committee took into account these considerations, along with other factors relevant to the firms' independence from management, and concluded that each firm was independent and the engagement of each firm would not raise any conflict of interest.  Role of Management 
The Compensation Committee considers input from our CEO in making determinations regarding our overall executive compensation program and the individual compensation of our senior executives, other than our CEO. As part of the annual planning process, our CEO develops targets for our annual bonus program and presents them to the Compensation Committee for consideration. Based on performance appraisals and information regarding competitive market practices provided by the independent compensation consultant, our CEO recommends base salary adjustments, STI opportunities and LTI levels for our senior executives, other than our CEO. In addition, each year, our CEO presents to the Compensation Committee and the directors his evaluation of each senior executive's contributions and performance over the past year, strengths and development needs and actions. He also reviews succession plans for each senior executive. 
Setting Compensation Levels 
After taking into account advice and recommendations from our CEO and the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee determines what changes, if any, should be made to the executive compensation program and sets the level of compensation for each senior executive with respect to each element of the compensation program. In setting these levels, the Compensation Committee reviews a detailed analysis of each senior executive's annual total direct compensation and the value of benefits under our retirement plans, including with respect to competitive market data, and reviews compensation tally sheets for our most senior executives that set forth each element of the executives' compensation and benefits. 
COMPENSATION ELEMENTS 
We provide a combination of pay elements and benefits to accomplish our executive compensation objectives. STI focus on the performance goals we believe drive stockholder value and for which our executives are responsible. LTI are equity based and include a combination of performance-based restricted stock and time-based restricted stock. We believe LTI are critical in aligning our executives' and stockholders' interests, and creating an effective retention measure. Together, we believe that these incentives focus our executives on making decisions that will benefit our stockholders and the price of our Common Stock over the long term. 
Our executive compensation program generally includes the following primary components: base salary, STI, LTI and retirement benefits.

 Base Salary 
Base salary is designed to provide competitive levels of compensation to executives based on their responsibilities, performance and experience. No specific formula is applied to determine the weight of each of these factors. We pay base salaries because they provide a basic level of compensation and are necessary to recruit and retain executives. At lower executive levels, base salaries represent a larger portion of total compensation in accordance with our pay philosophy. At more senior executive levels, a greater portion of overall compensation is progressively replaced with variable compensation opportunities. The Compensation Committee has historically followed a policy of primarily using performance bonus awards, rather than base salary increases, to reward outstanding performance. Base salary levels are also important because we generally tie the amount of STI and LTI opportunities and a substantial portion of our retirement benefits to a percentage of each executive's base salary. 
The year-over-year salary change for Mr. Chalovich was made to recognize the continued growth and profitability of the Corrugated Packaging segment. In making the change, the Compensation Committee evaluated compensation data for similarly sized manufacturing businesses to ensure that Mr. Chalovich's compensation remained competitive. 
The salary change for Mr. Porter reflects an approximate 20% reduction in his workload and hours in fiscal 2018, compared to fiscal 2017.

Annual bonus goals are established for each of the executives who participates in the program, including each NEO. Consistent with our philosophy of paying for performance, our NEOs' performance-based compensation rises and falls with our overall achievement of the performance goals. The size of the target annual executive bonus program opportunities is designed to provide competitive levels of compensation to executives based upon their experience, duties and scope of responsibilities. Target awards are based on a percentage of the executive's base salary. 
The amount actually paid to an executive under the annual executive bonus program is a function of the following variables: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's target bonus opportunity  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The goals established by the Compensation Committee for the executive  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For each goal, the attainment of minimum achievement levels (threshold), capped by maximum  achievement levels, and the Compensation Committee's determination of the extent to which the executive's goals were met.  
[END TABLE]
Awards earned under the annual executive bonus program are contingent upon continued employment through the end of the fiscal year (which is our performance period) and are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee (based on safety performance) to reduce the payout.  Performance Goals 
For fiscal 2018, the primary performance goals for each of our NEOs were EBITDA results and productivity results.

   EBITDA Results The Compensation Committee again assigned the greatest weighting to the consolidated EBITDA goal and, for fiscal 2018, increased the weighting of this goal for all NEOs because it believes maximizing consolidated EBITDA will drive  stockholder value over the long term.   For  STI purposes in calculating our consolidated EBITDA performance and the EBITDA performance of our Brazil business, our Integrated Consumer segment, our Integrated NA Corrugated Packaging business and MPS, EBITDA is generally calculated as  operating income adjusted to exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization; costs of discontinued operations or closed plants; certain severance costs; last in, first out inventory valuation expense; acquisition inventory step-up; expenses  from certain litigation; extraordinary items; asset impairment charges; pension expense resulting from proactive management of our pension liability; expenses or income from conforming accounting policies or income statement impact from M&A; new  accounting; pronouncements, cumulative effect of accounting changes and prior period accounting errors.   To reflect our acquisition of Plymouth Packaging in January 2018, we adjusted certain STI target goals upwards, so  that executives would not be unfairly advantaged by the acquisition – e.g., Consolidated EBITDA increased from $2,884,800,000 to $2,895,400,000 and target Integrated NA Corrugated EBITDA increased from $1,645,900,000 to  $1,656,500,000.

   Productivity Results For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee maintained the weighting of the productivity goal for all NEOs because it believes realizing productivity improvements will help us achieve our synergy and performance improvement goals.  We believe that our executive compensation program's focus on productivity since the Combination has played a positive role in achieving our $1 billion synergy and performance improvement goal.   For STI purposes, the productivity goals are measured  based on realized improvements. For fiscal 2018, the target opportunity for year-over-year productivity improvements was $268 million and we realized $239 million of improvements, resulting in awards that were lower than the target  opportunity for this component of our NEOs' bonuses.

   Safety Modifier We place a high value and emphasis on safety. For fiscal 2018, management evaluated safety results based on the following factors: OSHA recordable incident rate; lost work days; life changing events; year-over-year improvements; and  proactive safety activities. If safety results failed to meet certain predetermined performance objectives (e.g., a 5% improvement in the OSHA recordable incident rate and the lost work days measure), then the Compensation Committee had discretion  to reduce STI payouts by up to 10%.   We made  solid improvements in our safety performance in the majority of our businesses in fiscal 2018; however, the safety performance of certain businesses worsened and, as a result, the Compensation Committee reduced STI payouts at the Company level by  1%. Each of our NEOs was impacted by this reduction.

The fiscal 2018 bonus goals for Messrs. Voorhees and Dickson were based exclusively on consolidated Company measures because their positions had a substantial impact on the achievement of those measures. The fiscal 2018 bonus goals for Messrs. Porter, Feeser, Chalovich and Shore were based on a combination of consolidated Company measures (i.e. EBITDA and productivity) and measures focused on the results of the businesses they oversaw (Brazil EBITDA for Mr. Porter, Integrated Consumer Packaging Segment EBITDA for Mr. Feeser, Integrated North American Corrugated Packaging EBITDA for Mr. Chalovich and MPS EBITDA for Mr. Shore). Each NEO's target bonus amount was set at a percentage of his base salary, with payouts of 50% and 200% of that amount for threshold and maximum performance, respectively. Performance below threshold for a particular measure would result in no payout for that measure.  For fiscal 2018, Mr. Voorhees was eligible to earn a maximum cash bonus of 300% of his fiscal year base salary to the extent we achieved our safety goals and each of the following goals at or in excess of the maximum performance benchmarks.

Long-Term Incentives (LTI) 
We emphasize long-term variable compensation at the senior executive level over short-term variable compensation because of our desire to reward effective long-term management decision-making and our desire to attract and retain executives who have the potential to positively impact our long-term profitability. LTI awards are designed to allow us to focus attention on the successful execution of our long-term business strategy and providing future returns to our stockholders. 
For fiscal 2018, LTI awards consisted primarily of performance-based restricted stock (80% of the award value) – subject to either a cash flow per share measure (50% of the total award value) or a relative total shareholder return measure (30% of the total award value) – and time-based restricted stock (20% of the total award value). We believe that the combination of performance-based restricted stock with time-based restricted stock creates a strong at-risk LTI portfolio that provides optimal alignment among our stock price performance, our management team's long-term execution of our strategic plan and the LTI amounts actually realized by our executives. 
Timing 
While the Compensation Committee may grant LTI awards at any time, it generally approves awards for executives at its January or February meeting each year, except for awards related to promotions, new hires or acquisitions. Grants approved during scheduled meetings become effective and are priced as of the date of approval or as of a pre-determined future date based on a date of hire. Grants approved by unanimous written consent become effective and are priced as of a pre-determined future date. 
Performance-Based Restricted Stock 
Performance-based restricted stock is designed to incentivize and retain our executives by offering them the opportunity to receive shares of Common Stock upon achieving pre-determined performance criteria. The performance-based restricted stock awards include a service condition and a performance condition. In fiscal 2018, we utilized two performance conditions: one based on our achievement of specified cash flow per share and another based on our achievement of specified relative total shareholder return. In each case, performance will be assessed during the three-year period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020. 
For the cash flow per share-based awards, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable service requirement, the actual number of shares that will vest pursuant to the grants made on February 1, 2018 will be a percentage of the respective target awards based on our defined cash flow per share as follows:

[END TABLE]
 Awards for performance between these goal levels will be interpolated on a linear basis; provided performance in excess of the maximum goal level will not result in vesting in excess of 200% of the target award. 
The $6.20 cash flow per share target utilized for 2018 grants was 15% higher than the target utilized for 2017 grants. 
"Cash flow per share" is calculated as our "cash flow", divided by three, divided by the average of the "diluted weighted average shares outstanding" during the 12 quarters in the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020. The term "cash flow" means our "net cash provided by operating activities," as set forth in our statements of cash flow during the period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020; minus the actual amount of "capital expenditures" up to $3.21 billion (excluding expenditures for certain key specified capital projects) (and any amount over $3.21 billion in the discretion of the Compensation Committee), as set forth in our statements of cash flow during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020; plus the sum of all cash sources included in the "investing activities" section of our statements of cash flow during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020, but excluding any cash acquired in a merger (provided that the Compensation Committee may limit cash sources to $100 million in any year); plus the after-tax impact of any merger, acquisition and divestiture-related integration and restructuring costs; plus any payments made in connection with the cash settlement of any opening balance sheet liabilities related to costs of mergers and acquisitions recorded on the books of the acquired or merged entities; plus 32.3% (or our actual ownership percentage, if different than 32.3%) of the net income of our joint venture with Grupo Gondi; plus the after-tax impact of any cash payments relating to any multi-employer pension plan, other than normal pension contributions; plus any cash tax consequences arising from the prepayment of the Plum Creek Timber Note Holdings notes receivable or notes payable; plus any cash payments made in connection with certain claims and litigation. 
For the relative total shareholder return-based awards, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable service requirement, the actual number of shares that will vest pursuant to the grants made on February 1, 2018 will be a percentage of the respective target awards based on our relative total shareholder return (as defined below) as follows:

[END TABLE]
Awards for performance between these goal levels will be interpolated on a linear basis; provided performance in excess of the maximum goal level will not result in vesting in excess of 200% of the target award. Payouts under this performance measure are capped at target if our total shareholder return is negative over the performance period. 
"Total Shareholder Return" is calculated using the average of our Common Stock price for the 20 trading days prior to the start and end of the January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 performance period (i.e. the 20-day periods ending on December 31, 2017 for the initial period and on December 31, 2020 for the ending period) compared to the common stock price of companies included in the S&P 500 Materials Index using an identical calculation, provided that in all cases, dividends paid to stockholders during the performance period will be calculated in the results as a reinvestment on the ex-dividend date closing price. 
The performance-based restricted stock granted in fiscal 2018 is scheduled to vest on February 1, 2021 and provides for (i) dividend equivalent rights to be credited to the recipient prior to vesting on only the earned number of shares, (ii) early vesting in the event of a termination following a change in control, (iii) pro rata vesting upon retirement in certain circumstances and (iv) no voting rights prior to vesting. 
Stock Options 
Stock options are granted at fair market value, and have a three-year vesting period and a 10-year term. Although stock options have been awarded in the past, the Compensation Committee did not award them in either fiscal 2018 or fiscal 2017. 
Time-Based Restricted Stock 
For fiscal 2018, 20% of target LTI compensation value was awarded in the form of time-based restricted stock to encourage executive retention. The Compensation Committee approves a dollar value for these awards and recipient is granted a number of shares of restricted stock equal to that value. The economic value calculated for each award is based on the grant date stock price of our Common Stock. The time-based restricted stock typically vests on the third anniversary of the grant date and provides for (i) dividend equivalent rights to be credited to the recipient prior to vesting on only the earned number of shares, (ii) early vesting in the event of a termination following a change in control, (iii) pro rata vesting upon retirement in certain circumstances and (iv) no voting rights prior to vesting.  Restoration Award to Mr. Voorhees 
As reported in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2017, in September 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Voorhees returned 20,588 shares of Common Stock, representing the number of shares awarded,  as part of a long-term incentive grant made to him in January 2014, in excess of the then applicable grant limit, net of 18,967 shares that had been withheld to satisfy applicable taxes when the performance-based award vested, plus $24,706  representing cash dividends received on the 20,588 shares of vested stock and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An incentive stock grant made to Mr. Voorhees in August 2015 was reduced by 50,326 unvested  shares, representing the number of shares awarded in excess of the grant limit under the applicable plan.  
[END TABLE]
As previously disclosed in our 8-K filed on September 28, 2017, at the time these shares were returned/forfeited, the Compensation Committee contemplated restoring their value, based on actual performance achieved under both grants, since the shares represented appropriate incentives intended to be provided to Mr. Voorhees in each of 2014 and 2015 (and were reported in the Summary Compensation Table Stock Awards column and related compensation tables for each of those years). As such, on February 2, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved an award to Mr. Voorhees of 96,092 shares of Common Stock, restoring the value of his returned shares and his forfeited shares (based on actual performance achieved) and returned cash dividends. Because the returned and forfeited shares and returned cash dividends would all have vested prior to the date of the award, the Compensation Committee determined that the shares subject to the award should vest upon grant. 
Fiscal 2018 LTI Awards 
The Compensation Committee made the following LTI grants to our NEOs in fiscal 2018.

 OTHER COMPENSATION PRACTICES AND POLICIES 
Consideration of Risk in Compensation Policies 
Our compensation plans, policies and practices are designed to implement our compensation philosophy of motivating our executive officers to achieve our business objectives in the short term and to grow our business to create long-term value for our stockholders. As part of our annual review of our compensation plans, policies and practices, we conduct a risk assessment to ensure that such plans, policies and practices are not encouraging undue risk taking. In addition, we utilize a mix of performance measures, so that undue emphasis is not placed on one particular measure, and employ different types of compensation to provide value over the short- and long-term. 
Officer Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements 
Certain of our executives, including our NEOs, are expected to meet or exceed specified levels of Common Stock ownership in order to align their interests with those of our stockholders. The Board has established the following ownership guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Position         Target Ownership          
   Position         Target Ownership          
   Position         Target Ownership          
   Chief Executive Officer                6 times base salary              
   Chief Executive Officer                6 times base salary              
   Chief Executive Officer                6 times base salary              
   Other Designated Executives                3 times base salary              
   Other Designated Executives                3 times base salary              
   Other Designated Executives                3 times base salary              
[END TABLE]
In determining compliance with these guidelines, stock ownership includes shares owned outright, vested or unvested stock grants, stock unit grants or deferred stock units, and shares held in trust for the benefit of the individual. Executives have five years from the date of their designation to achieve the targeted level of ownership. 
All of our NEOs have achieved the targeted level of ownership. 
Certain of our executives, including our NEOs, are required to retain 50% of the restricted stock awarded to the individual, net of any shares used to satisfy any related tax liability upon vesting, for a period of two years following the vesting of the restricted stock or until the individual no longer serves as an employee. The retention period does not apply to any shares to the extent the recipient continues to own an amount of Common Stock at least equal to the amount of shares required under the preceding sentence, plus the amount of shares required to be held under our stock ownership guidelines. 
Anti-Hedging/Anti-Pledging Policy 
We maintain a policy that prohibits our directors and officers who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, members of our leadership team and other designated employees from (i) holding Common Stock in margin accounts, (ii) pledging Common Stock as collateral for a loan, (iii) trading in options, warrants, puts, calls or similar instruments on our Common Stock or (iv) short selling Common Stock. 
Clawback Provisions 
The Compensation Committee has adopted clawback provisions that apply to awards made to our NEOs pursuant to our annual executive bonus program and incentive stock plans that allow us to recapture amounts paid or stock granted to NEOs that vests based upon financial results that we are required to restate at a future date if the Compensation Committee determines that the restatement is based in whole or in part upon any misconduct by an applicable NEO. These provisions require an applicable NEO to pay us an amount of cash or deliver an amount of shares of Common Stock equal to the benefit received by the NEO because of the misstatement of financial results. These provisions apply to misstatements of financial results that are discovered within 24 months after an applicable stock grant has vested or bonus has been paid. The Compensation Committee may adopt changes to the clawback provisions once the SEC issues final rules and the NYSE adopts related listing standards implementing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to compensation recovery. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
The Tax Code generally imposes a $1 million limit on the amount that a public company may deduct for compensation paid to its covered executive officers. This limitation previously did not apply to compensation that met the Tax Code requirements for "qualifying performance-based" compensation. Historically, we designed our compensation programs to qualify for this performance-based exception by, for example, establishing performance goals and maximum amounts that could be granted to executive officers. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, this exemption has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that we expect that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible in future fiscal years unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.  Employment Agreements and Change in Control Agreements 
Mr. Porter 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Porter in 2015 that superseded an employment agreement with him that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Southern Container Corp. in 2008. Upon Mr. Porter's termination of employment for any reason, except without "cause" (as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to receive compensation and benefits accrued through the termination date. In addition, Mr. Porter's outstanding unvested stock options, if any, will vest and become exercisable, and, provided any applicable performance goals under outstanding unvested long-term incentive awards (other than stock options) are satisfied, awards granted in any calendar year prior to the calendar year in which his employment terminates will vest, and he will be vested in a prorated portion of any awards granted in the calendar year in which his employment terminates. If we terminate Mr. Porter's employment at any time for "cause", he will only be entitled to compensation and benefits accrued through the termination date, and he will not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits. Mr. Porter's employment agreement includes a non-compete provision that is applicable for two years following termination and a non-solicitation provision that is applicable for three years following termination. 
Mr. Chalovich 
We assumed an employment agreement with Mr. Chalovich in connection with our acquisition of Southern Container Corp. in 2008. Pursuant to the agreement, if we terminate Mr. Chalovich without "gross cause" (as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to receive compensation and benefits accrued through the termination date and to receive salary and paid COBRA continuation for one year, as well as a pro-rated bonus. 
Mr. Feeser 
We assumed an employment agreement with Mr. Feeser in connection with the Combination that provided for the payment of certain benefits to Mr. Feeser in the event he was terminated by us for other than "cause" or "disability", or Mr. Feeser claimed termination for "good reason" (each as defined in the agreement) through the second anniversary of the Combination, or July 1, 2017. In 2016, we amended Mr. Feeser's employment agreement. In consideration for him terminating his right to claim termination for good reason, we agreed to provide him with a lump sum payment equal to up to three years of additional pension accrual for age and service under the Retirement Restoration Plan and Executive Retirement Plan (each as described in "Compensation Matters – Executive Compensation Tables – Retirement Plans – Retirement Restoration Plan and Executive Retirement Plan") depending on his date of retirement. If he retires after December 31, 2020, he will not receive any additional pension accrual. 
Mr. Shore 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Shore on January 23, 2017. The agreement became effective on June 6, 2017, the effective date of our acquisition of MPS. Pursuant to the agreement, if we terminate Mr. Shore without "cause" or Mr. Shore terminates his employment for "good reason" (each as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to receive (i) his salary for 12 months from the date of termination, (ii) a prorated bonus for the year of his termination, (iii) prorated vesting of restricted stock and other long-term incentive awards granted to him by the Company pursuant to his employment agreement and (iv) COBRA continuation coverage for 12 months. Mr. Shore's employment agreement includes a non-compete provision that is applicable for one year following termination and a non-solicitation provision that is applicable for two years following termination. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018.

(A)  The WestRock Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan") provides  eligible employees with a matching contribution of 100% of the first 5% of pay they contribute to the plan. In addition, for eligible employees, we contribute 2.5% of their eligible pay at the end of the calendar year. For purposes of the 401(k)  Plan, eligible pay is limited by IRS regulation to $275,000 in 2018. Under the SERP, the executives receive a match of 100% of the first 5% of their contributions in excess of the IRS limit of $275,000 and an additional 2.5% of eligible salary in  excess of $275,000. Eligible salary includes salary and non-equity incentive compensation. Due to the ongoing pension benefits provided to Mr. Feeser, he is not eligible for the additional 2.5% Company  contribution in either plan. Additionally, we contributed designated amounts to Mr. Porter's individual retirement account. Due to Mr. Porter's individual retirement account contributions, he is not eligible for the additional 2.5% Company  contribution. Certain amounts disclosed in this row are also disclosed in the table below titled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table". Mr. Shore was eligible to receive the Company match but not the additional 2.5% Company  contribution in fiscal 2018.  
(B)  In accordance with SEC regulations, we report the use of corporate aircraft by our executive  officers as a perquisite or other personal benefit unless it is "integrally and directly related" to the performance of the executive's duties. SEC rules require us to report this and other perquisites at our aggregate incremental  cost. We estimate our aggregate incremental cost to be equal to our average incremental operating costs, which includes items such as fuel; maintenance; landing fees; trip-related permits; trip-related hangar costs; trip-related meals and supplies;  crew expenses during layovers; and any other expenses incurred or accrued based on the number of hours flown. We use this method because we believe, on average, it fairly approximates our incremental cost and because it ensures that some  "cost" is allocated to each passenger on each trip. Although Mr. Porter was entitled to make use of the corporate aircraft for limited personal use in fiscal 2018, he did not choose to do so.  
(C)  For Mr. Porter, this amount includes $12,000 for his automobile allowance and $8,851 for tax gross-up payments related to our payment of this allowance.  
(7)  In order to show the effect of the restoration award to Mr. Voorhees on total compensation, as  determined under applicable SEC rules, we have included an additional column to show Mr. Voorhees' total compensation less this item. The amounts reported in the Total Without Restoration Award to Voorhees column differ substantially from  the amounts reported in the Total column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total compensation. Total Without Restoration Award to Voorhees represents total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the value  of the restoration award to Mr. Voorhees reported in the Stock Awards column. See "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Compensation Elements — Long-Term Incentives (LTI) – Restoration Award to  Mr. Voorhees" for more information.  
(8)  Compensation information for Mr. Shore is provided only for fiscal 2018 and 2017 because he was  not a NEO of the Company in fiscal 2016.

(2)  Reflects a restoration award of shares to Mr. Voorhees that was intended to restore the value  of vested shares and dividends he returned and unvested shares he forfeited in fiscal 2017, which represented portions of long-term incentive awards granted to him in 2014 and 2015 that exceeded applicable plan limits in effect at the time of grant.  See "—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Elements—Long-Term Incentives (LTI)—Restoration Award to Mr. Voorhees" for more information.

 OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR-END
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation awards outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and provides information concerning unexercised options, other stock-based awards that have not vested and equity incentive plan awards for each NEO outstanding as of the end of fiscal 2018. Each outstanding award is represented by a separate row which indicates the number of securities underlying the award, including awards that have been transferred other than for value (if any). For option awards, the table discloses the exercise price and the expiration date. For stock awards, the table provides the total number of shares of stock that have not vested and the aggregate market value of shares of stock that have not vested. We computed the market value of stock awards by multiplying the closing sale price of our Common Stock at the end of fiscal 2018 by the number of shares of stock or the amount of equity incentive plan awards, respectively. Shares and option exercise prices have been adjusted for the separation of our specialty chemicals business in 2016.

 RETIREMENT PLANS 
In addition to the annual and long-term components of our executive compensation program, each NEO participates in Company-sponsored U.S.-based retirement plans. We primarily provide current retirement benefits to our NEOs through the WestRock Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan and the WestRock Company Deferred Compensation Plan. In addition: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Voorhees has an accrued benefit under each of the Pension Plan and the SERP, which such  benefits have been frozen since December 31, 2015 and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Feeser's age and service qualified him under a grandfathered provision to receive  additional benefit accruals under the Pension Plan until December 31, 2020. However, due to adjustments required to pass non-discrimination testing, Mr. Feeser ceased to accrue benefits under this  plan as of September 30, 2016, as set forth in the 2016 amendment to his employment agreement; instead, he will continue to accrue a benefit under the Retirement Restoration Plan and the Executive Retirement Plan until the earlier of  December 31, 2020 or his termination.  
[END TABLE]
No employee's compensation for purposes of the Pension Plan or the WestRock Company 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan includes amounts in excess of the compensation limit under the Tax Code, which limit is adjusted periodically for inflation. The limit, as adjusted, was $270,000 for 2017 and $275,000 for 2018. 
The following table includes information about each of our retirement plans and indicates which NEOs participate in the plans.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
The following table provides information with respect to each nonqualified deferred compensation plan that is a defined contribution plan, also called an individual account plan. The amounts shown include compensation earned and deferred in prior years, and earnings on, or distributions of, such amounts. 
The column "Executive Contributions in Last Fiscal Year" indicates the aggregate amount contributed to such plans by each NEO during fiscal 2018 taking into account contributions made in fiscal 2019 with respect to fiscal 2018. 
The column "Registrant Contributions in Last Fiscal Year" indicates our aggregate contributions on behalf of each named executive officer during fiscal 2018 taking into account contributions made in fiscal 2019 with respect to fiscal 2018. We also make matching contributions or profit sharing contributions to our qualified 401(k) plans, but those plans are tax qualified and, therefore, we do not include our contributions to them in this table. We include our matches to all defined contribution plans in the table titled "All Other Compensation Table" included in footnote 6 of the table titled "Summary Compensation Table" above. 
The column "Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year" indicates the total dollar amount of interest or other earnings accrued during fiscal 2018, including interest and dividends paid at market rates. We pay such amounts to compensate the executive for the deferral, and we do not consider the payment of interest and other earnings at market rates to be compensation. 
The column "Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year-End" reports the total balance of the executive's account as of September 30, 2018 taking into account contributions made in fiscal 2019 with respect to fiscal 2018.  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018

 CEO PAY RATIO 
The compensation of our median employee in fiscal 2018 was $53,553, while the compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $18,030,504 (including the restoration equity award described on page 36 under the heading "Restoration Award to Mr. Voorhees"), yielding a CEO pay ratio of 337 times the median. As noted on page 36, the Compensation Committee approved a restoration award to our CEO in fiscal 2018 to address the return and forfeiture of shares, cash and awards by him in fiscal 2017 due to an administrative error with respect to our stock plans. Excluding this restoration award, the compensation of our CEO in fiscal 2018 would have been $11,569,278, yielding a CEO pay ratio of 216 times the median. Our median employee is located in the United States. 
To identify our median employee, we identified our total employee population as of August 15, 2018 and, in accordance with SEC rules, excluded the CEO, employees who joined us from acquisitions during the year (1) and all employees from certain countries representing in aggregate less than 5% of our employee base (2), to arrive at the median employee consideration pool. We used the consistently applied compensation measure of gross earnings, which we measured from August 16, 2017 to August 15, 2018. Foreign exchange rates were translated to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on rates as of August 15, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  We excluded 105 employees from Plymouth Packaging and 57 employees from Catalyst Cards.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  These countries and their headcounts as of the sample date were: Belgium (373), Czech Republic  (327), Mexico (294), Australia (249), Netherlands (158), Spain (144), Dominican Republic (114), Chile (70), Japan (58), Argentina (54), Austria (29), Hong Kong (18), Korea (17), Thailand (11), South Switzerland (5), Taiwan (5), Italy (4), Malaysia  (4), New Zealand (3), Singapore (2), Luxembourg (1) and South Africa (1), for a total of 1,941 employees. As of August 15, 2018, using the methodology required by the rule governing this disclosure, we had approximately 30,800 U.S.  employees and approximately 14,200 employees in other countries, for a total of approximately 45,000 employees globally factored into the sample before the country exclusions listed above.  
[END TABLE]
The pay ratio disclosure presented above is a reasonable estimate. Because SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, our CEO pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.  AUDIT MATTERS 
ITEM 4. RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP 
What am I voting on? The Board is asking our stockholders to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 
Voting Recommendation: FOR the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm 
Vote Required: An affirmative vote requires the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee is comprised of six independent directors. The Board has determined that all Audit Committee members are "financially literate" within the meaning of the NYSE Standards and that each of Ms. Martore and Messrs. Crews and Powers qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations. 
The Audit Committee met seven times during fiscal 2018. These meetings included periodic executive sessions with our independent registered public accounting firm, our internal auditor and management. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee was updated no less than quarterly on management's process to assess the adequacy of our system of internal control over financial reporting, the framework used to make the assessment and management's conclusions on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, compensating, retaining and overseeing our independent auditor. The Audit Committee evaluates the independence, qualifications and performance of our independent auditor each year, and determines whether to re-engage the current independent auditor. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditor and its capabilities, technical expertise and knowledge of our operations. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has retained Ernst & Young LLP as our independent auditor for fiscal 2019 and the Board is recommending that our stockholders ratify this appointment. 
EY has served as the Company's or its predecessor's independent auditors since at least 1975, but is unable to determine the specific year during which it was originally engaged. We believe that EY's global capabilities, technical expertise, significant institutional knowledge of our business, quality, candor of communications with the Audit Committee and management, and independence enhance audit quality. The Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting, for preparing our financial statements and for the public reporting process. Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018, is responsible for expressing opinions that (a) our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and (b) we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2018. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended  September 30, 2018 with management  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussed with the independent auditor those matters required to be discussed by auditors with the  Audit Committee under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB")  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor as required by  applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditor its independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the reviews and discussion described in this report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring pre-approval of audit and permissible audit-related and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The following services have been pre-approved:
All other audit, audit-related and non-audit services must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its Chair. Engagements for our annual audit and quarterly reviews required under the Exchange Act are pre-approved annually, and the nature and dollar value of these services are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee. 
The independent registered public accounting firm and management report to the Audit Committee periodically regarding the services rendered by, and actual fees paid to, the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that the services are within the limits approved by the Audit Committee.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS OR DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
SEC rules permit stockholders to submit proposals for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and form of proxy if the stockholder and the proposal meet the requirements specified in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. To be considered for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement, a stockholder proposal submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 must be received by us at our principal executive offices by no later than August 20, 2019. 
Our Bylaws provide that any stockholder proposal, including director nominations, that is not submitted for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement under Rule 14a-8, but is instead sought to be presented directly at next year's annual meeting of stockholders must be delivered to our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. In each case, the notice must include the information specified in the Bylaws. If the 2020 annual meeting is held more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the Annual Meeting, notice must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the seventh day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. Stockholders will vote at the Annual Meeting on the matters summarized in this Proxy Statement.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
The Annual Meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. (local time) on February 1, 2019 at The Westin Atlanta Perimeter North, 7 Concourse Parkway, Atlanta, GA 30328. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
Stockholders will vote at the Annual Meeting on the matters summarized in this Proxy Statement. 
Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 
You received these proxy materials because you are a Company stockholder and the Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to provide you under SEC rules and is designed to assist you in voting your shares. 
What is included in these proxy materials? What is a Proxy Statement and what is a proxy? 
The proxy materials for the Annual Meeting include the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and our annual report. If you received a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. A Proxy Statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares, and that other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated Mr. Voorhees and Mr. McIntosh as proxies for the Annual Meeting.  What does it mean if I receive more than one notice, proxy materials email or proxy card? 
It means you have multiple accounts with brokers and/or our transfer agent. You will need to vote separately with respect to each notice, proxy materials email or proxy card you receive. 
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Instead of mailing a printed copy of the proxy materials to each stockholder of record, the SEC permits us to furnish proxy materials by providing access to those documents on the Internet. Stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. The notice instructs you as to how to submit your proxy on the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions in the notice for requesting those materials. 
Who may vote? 
You may vote if you owned Common Stock as of the close of business on December 7, 2018, the record date. 
How may I vote? 
You may vote by any of the following methods:

These terms describe the manner in which your shares are held. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are a registered holder. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, brokerage or other nominee as custodian on your behalf, you are a beneficial holder. 
What if I am a beneficial holder and do not give voting instructions to my broker? 
As a beneficial holder, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote. Proposals #1, #2 and #3 are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial holders. Proposal #4 is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial holders may vote on this proposal in their discretion. 
What is householding? 
Beneficial holders who share a single address may receive only one copy of the notice or the proxy materials, as the case may be, unless their broker, bank or other nominee has received contrary instructions from any beneficial holder at that address. This is known as householding. If any beneficial holder(s) sharing a single address wishes to discontinue householding and/or receive a separate copy of the notice or the proxy materials, as the case may be, or wish to enroll in householding, they should contact their broker, bank or other nominee directly. Alternatively, if any such beneficial holders wish to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, we will deliver them promptly upon request either by phone (by dialing 770 448-2193) or in writing (by mailing a request to WestRock Company, 1000 Abernathy Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, Attention: Corporate Secretary). 
When will the Company announce the voting results? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will report the final results on our website and in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.  APPENDIX A: Proposed Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of WRKCo Inc.
