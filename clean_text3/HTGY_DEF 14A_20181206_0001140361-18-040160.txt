 Purpose    At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to (i) approve the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, to the Company, which would permit the Company to double the maximum amount of leverage that it is currently permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to the Company from 200% to 150% to become effective the day after the Special Meeting (without giving effect to any exemptive relief with respect to Small Business Administration debentures) and (ii) transact such other business as may properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof.   
 Record Date    You have the right to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting if you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on October 4, 2018. We plan to begin mailing this Proxy Statement on or about October 5, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote their shares at the Special Meeting.
