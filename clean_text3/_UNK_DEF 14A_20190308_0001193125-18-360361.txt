PROXY STATEMENT 
January 12, 2019 
Annual Meeting of Stockholders to Be Held on March 8, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of PGIM Global Short Duration High Yield Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), of proxies to be exercised at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Fund to be held at 655 Broad Street, 17th Floor, Newark, New Jersey 07102, on March 8, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and at any postponements or adjournments thereof (the "Meeting"). The purposes of the Meeting and the matters to be acted upon are set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice"). The Board knows of no business other than the election of the four (4) Class I Directors, and procedural matters relating to the Meeting or the election of Directors, that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented at the Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote in their discretion on such matter. 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying materials are first being made available to stockholders on or about January 12, 2019. 
The Fund is organized as a Maryland corporation and is a registered investment company. 
PGIM Investments LLC ("PGIM Investments" or the "Manager") serves as the Fund's investment manager. PGIM Investments and its predecessors have served as a manager or administrator to registered investment companies since 1987. PGIM Investments' principal address is 655 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102. PGIM, Inc. ("PGIM" or the "Subadviser") serves as the Fund's subadviser, through its PGIM Fixed Income unit. PGIM is a registered investment adviser and, through its PGIM Fixed Income unit, is responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund. PGIM's principal address is 655 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102. Both PGIM Investments and PGIM are indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial, Inc. ("Prudential"). As of September 30, 2018, PGIM Investments served as the manager to open-end investment companies, and as manager or administrator, as applicable, to closed-end investment companies with total aggregate assets of approximately $286 billion. The Board, in addition to overseeing the actions of the Manager and Subadviser, decides upon matters of general policy relating to the Fund. The Fund does not have a principal underwriter. 
Even if you plan to attend the Meeting, please sign, date and return a proxy card, or provide voting instructions by telephone or over the Internet. If you authorize a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, you will be asked to enter a unique code that has been assigned to you and which is printed on your proxy card. This code is designed to confirm your identity, provide access into the voting sites and confirm that your instructions are properly recorded. If you require additional information, please call toll free at 1-866-864-3926. 
All properly authorized proxies received prior to or at the Meeting will be exercised at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked thereon or otherwise as provided therein. Unless instructions to the contrary are given, votes entitled to be cast by stockholders represented by the proxies will be cast "FOR" the election of each nominee listed in Proposal No. 1 and in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that may properly be brought before the Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Stockholders who authorize proxies may revoke them at any time before they are exercised by filing with the Fund a written notice of revocation at or prior to the start of the Meeting, by duly authorizing a proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. In accordance with the Fund's Bylaws, a quorum is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of outstanding shares of the Fund's common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, a stockholder who properly authorizes a proxy but instructs the proxy holder to "abstain" or "withhold authority" will be treated as present for determining the presence of a quorum. 
The Board has fixed the close of business on December 14, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders of the Fund entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Each share of stock entitles the holder of the share as of the Record Date to cast one vote for as many individuals as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted and a fractional vote with respect to fractional shares, with no cumulative voting rights. At the close of business on the Record Date, the Fund had 40,927,409 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meeting. 
Annual reports are sent to stockholders of record of the Fund following the Fund's fiscal year end. The Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its annual report and most recent semi-annual report succeeding the annual report, if any, to a stockholder upon request. Such requests should be directed to the Fund at 655 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey 07102 or call toll free at (800) 451-6788 or visit the Fund's website at www.pgiminvestments.com or on the EDGAR Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Internet site at www.sec.gov. This reference to the website does not incorporate the contents of the website into this Proxy Statement. 
Please note that only one annual or semi-annual report or Proxy Statement may be delivered to two or more stockholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of an annual or semi-annual report or the Proxy Statement or for instructions as to how to request a separate copy of these documents or as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies of these documents are received, stockholders should contact the Fund at the address and phone number set forth above. 
The expenses of solicitation will include reimbursement of brokerage firms and others for expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to beneficial owners. The solicitation of proxies will be largely by mail. 
Vote Required and Manner of Voting Proxies 
A quorum of stockholders is required to take action at the Meeting. The presence of stockholders of record as of the Record Date entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum. 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Meeting. The inspector of elections will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the Meeting. A stockholder who properly executes a proxy but instructs the proxy holder to "abstain" or "withhold authority," or who is present at the Meeting in person but who abstains from voting on any matter, and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees, typically in "street name," as to which proxies have been returned but (a) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (b) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter), if any, will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
If you hold shares directly (not through a broker-dealer, bank or other financial intermediary) and if you return a signed proxy card that does not specify how you wish to vote on a proposal, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of each nominee listed in Proposal No. 1.  Broker-dealer firms or other nominees holding shares of the Fund in "street name" for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares on each Proposal before the Meeting. A signed voting instruction card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of Fund shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner's shares should be voted will be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the election of each nominee listed in Proposal No. 1. 
If you hold shares of the Fund through a service agent that has entered into a service agreement with the Fund, the service agent may be the record holder of your shares. At the Meeting, a service agent will vote shares for which it receives instructions from its customers in accordance with those instructions. A signed proxy card or other authorization by a stockholder that does not specify how the stockholder's shares should be voted on a proposal may be deemed to authorize a service agent to vote such shares in favor of the election of each nominee listed in Proposal No. 1. Depending on its policies, applicable law or contractual or other restrictions, a service agent may be permitted to vote shares with respect to which it has not received specific voting instructions from its customers. In those cases, the service agent may, but may not be required to, vote such shares in the same proportion as those shares for which the service agent has received voting instructions. This practice is commonly referred to as "echo voting." 
If you beneficially own shares that are held in "street name" through a broker-dealer or other nominees or that are held of record by a service agent and if you do not give specific voting instructions for your shares, they may not be voted at all or, as described above, they may be voted in a manner that you may not intend. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to give your broker-dealer, other nominee or service agent specific instructions as to how you want your votes to be cast. 
Required Vote 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors are elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Fund's  common stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For purposes of the election of Directors, abstentions and broker  non-votes, if any, will not be considered votes cast, and will have the same effect as a vote against the election of a Director.  
[END TABLE]
In the event that a quorum is not present, or if proxies for sufficient votes to elect one or more of the nominees for election as Directors listed in Proposal No. 1 are not received by the time scheduled for the Meeting, pursuant to our bylaws the chair of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting to another date and time announced at the Meeting without a vote of the stockholders present at the Meeting or the persons named as proxies may move for one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to such proposal. In determining whether to adjourn the Meeting, the following factors may be considered: the nature of the proposal that is the subject of the Meeting, the percentage of the stockholders present at the Meeting in person or by proxy, the nature of any further solicitation and the information to be provided to stockholders with respect to the reasons for the solicitation. Approval of any proposal to adjourn the Meeting brought before the Fund's stockholders will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such matter at the Meeting. If an adjournment is properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote the shares that they are entitled to vote in their discretion.

Compensation of Directors and Officers. Pursuant to a Management Agreement with the Fund, the Manager pays all compensation and expenses of officers and employees of the Fund as well as the fees and expenses of all management Interested Directors. 
The Fund pays each of its Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors annual compensation in addition to certain out-of-pocket expenses. Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors who serve on committees of the Board may receive additional compensation. The amount of annual compensation paid to each Independent Director and non-management Interested Director may change as a result of the introduction of additional funds on whose board the Directors may be asked to serve. 
Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors may defer receipt of their fees pursuant to a deferred fee agreement with the Fund. Under the terms of the agreement, the Fund accrues deferred Independent Directors' and non-management Interested Directors' fees daily which, in turn, accrue interest at a rate equivalent to the prevailing rate of 90-day U.S. Treasury Bills at the beginning of each calendar quarter or at the daily rate of return of any PGIM mutual fund chosen by the Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors. Payment of the interest so accrued is also deferred and becomes payable at the option of the Independent Directors/ non-management Interested Directors. The Fund's obligation to make payments of deferred Independent Directors'/non-management Interested Directors' fees, together with interest thereon, is a general obligation of the Fund. The Fund does not have a retirement or pension plan for its Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors. 
The following table sets forth the compensation paid by the Fund to the Independent Directors and non-management Interested Directors for service on the Board for the Fund's fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, and the board of any other investment company in the PGIM mutual fund complex (the "Fund Complex") for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017. Aggregate compensation received by Directors serving for the full calendar year ended December 31, 2018 is not expected to be materially different than the 2017 compensation   detailed in the table below. With the exception of Grace C. Torres, who serves as a non-management Interested Director, Interested Directors do not receive compensation from PGIM Investments-managed funds and therefore are not shown in the following table.

Leadership Structure and Qualifications of Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for oversight of the Fund. The Fund has engaged the Manager to manage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The Board oversees the Manager and certain other principal service providers in the operations of the Fund. The Board is currently composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Directors. The Board meets in-person at regularly scheduled meetings four times throughout the year. In addition, the Directors may meet in-person or by telephone at special meetings or on an informal basis at other times. As described above, the Board has established three standing committees — Audit, Nominating and Governance, and Dryden Investment — and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Independent Directors have also engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities. 
The Board is chaired by an Independent Director. As Chair, this Independent Director leads the Board in its activities. Also, the Chair acts as a member or as an ex-officio member of each standing committee and any ad hoc committee of the Board. The Directors have determined that the Board's leadership and committee structure is appropriate because the Board believes it sets the proper tone to the relationships between the Fund, on the one hand, and the Manager, the Subadviser and certain other principal service providers, on the other hand, and facilitates the exercise of the Board's independent judgment in evaluating and managing these relationships. In   addition, the structure efficiently allocates responsibility among committees. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Board met 7 times. Each Director then a Board Member attended all of the meetings of the Board and the committees of which he or she was a member. The Fund does not have a policy regarding the Directors' attendance at annual meetings of stockholders, and no Directors attended the Fund's annual meeting of stockholders held in March 2018. 
The Board has concluded that, based on each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Directors, each Director should serve as a Director. Among other attributes common to all Directors are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the various service providers to the Fund, and to exercise reasonable business judgment in the performance of their duties as Directors. In addition, the Board has taken into account the actual service and commitment of the Directors during their tenure in concluding that each should continue to serve. A Director's ability to perform his or her duties effectively may have been attained through a Director's educational background or professional training; business, consulting, public service or academic positions; experience from service as a Director of the Fund, other funds in the Fund Complex, public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations; other experiences or a combination of the foregoing. 
Set forth below is a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Director that led the Board to conclude that he or she should serve as a Director.

Specific details about each Board Member's professional experience appear in the professional biography tables, above. 
Risk Oversight. Investing in general and the operation of a registered investment company involves a variety of risks, such as investment risk, compliance risk and operational risk, among others. The Board oversees risk as part of its oversight of the Fund. Risk oversight is addressed as part of various regular Board and committee activities. The Board, directly or through its committees, reviews reports from, among others, the Manager, subadviser, the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, counsel, and internal auditors of the Manager or its affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and the risk management programs of the Manager and certain service providers. The actual day-to-day risk management with respect to the Fund resides with the Manager and other service providers to the Fund. Although the risk management policies of the Manager and the service providers are designed to be effective, those policies and their implementation vary among service providers and over time, and there is no guarantee that they will be effective. Not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects, and some risks are simply beyond any control of the Fund or the Manager, its affiliates or other service providers. 
Selection of Director Nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for considering nominees for election as Directors at such times as it considers electing new members to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee may consider recommendations by business and personal contacts of current Directors and by executive search firms which the committee may engage from time to time and will also consider stockholder recommendations. The Nominating and Governance Committee has not established specific, minimum qualifications that it believes must be met by a nominee. In evaluating nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, among other things, an individual's background, skills, and experience; whether the individual is an "interested person" as defined in the 1940 Act; and whether the individual would be deemed an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. The Nominating and Governance Committee also considers whether the individual's background, skills, and experience will complement the background, skills, and experience of other nominees and Directors and will contribute to the diversity of the Board. There are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates nominees for the Board based on whether the nominee is recommended by a stockholder. 
A stockholder who wishes to recommend a person for nomination for election as a Director should submit his or her recommendation in writing to the Chair of the Board (Keith F. Hartstein) or the Chair of the   Nominating and Governance Committee (Linda W. Bynoe), in either case in care of the Fund, at 655 Broad Street, 17th Floor, Newark, New Jersey 07102. At a minimum, the recommendation should include: the name, address and business, educational and/or other pertinent background of the person being recommended; a statement concerning whether the person is an "interested person" of the Fund as defined in the 1940 Act; any other information that the Fund would be required to include in a proxy statement concerning the person if he or she was nominated; and the name and address of the person submitting the recommendation, together with the shares of stock of the Fund held by such person and the period for which the shares have been held. The recommendation also can include any additional information which the person submitting it believes would assist the Nominating and Governance Committee in evaluating the recommendation. 
Stockholders should note that a person who owns securities issued by Prudential Financial, Inc. (the parent company of the Manager) would be deemed an "interested person" under the 1940 Act. In addition, certain other relationships with Prudential Financial, Inc. or its subsidiaries, with registered broker-dealers, or with the Fund's outside legal counsel may cause a person to be deemed an "interested person." Before the Nominating and Governance Committee decides to recommend that the Board nominate an individual to the Board, committee members and other Directors customarily interview the individual in person. In addition, the individual is customarily asked to complete a detailed questionnaire which is designed to elicit information which must be disclosed under SEC and stock exchange rules and to determine whether the individual is subject to any statutory disqualification from serving on the board of a registered investment company.

The Board of Directors of the PGIM Global Short Duration High Yield Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") has an Audit Committee consisting of Kevin J. Bannon (Chair), Laurie Simon Hodrick, Michael S. Hyland, CFA, Brian K. Reid and Keith F. Hartstein (ex-officio). Each member of the Audit Committee (i) is not an "interested person" of the Fund or of PGIM Investments, within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") and (ii) meets the "independence" requirements of Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has a charter, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is also available on the Fund's web site at http://www.pgiminvestments.com. 
The function of the Audit Committee is to oversee the Fund's accounting and financial reporting processes, which includes the selection, retention, compensation and termination of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. In connection therewith, the Audit Committee reviews with management and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, among other things, the scope of the independent registered accounting firm's audit of the Fund's financial statements, reviews and discusses the Fund's annual audited financial statements with management, reviews the independent registered public accounting firm's required communications regarding the scope and results of the audit, reviews and approves in advance the types of services to be rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm, reviews matters related to the independence of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and in general considers and reports to the Board on matters regarding the Fund's accounting and financial reporting processes. 
In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on September 19, 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Fund's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended July 31, 2018 with management of the Fund and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and discussed the audit of such financial statements with the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accountants the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU Section 380). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees) and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. 
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, accountants or auditors by profession or experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including in respect of auditor independence or internal controls notwithstanding the fact that one or more members may be designated an "audit committee financial expert." Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it and representations made by management or the independent registered public accountants. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is in fact "independent." 
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions and reports referred to above with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Audit Committee Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors of the Fund that the Fund's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, 2018 be included in the Fund's annual report to stockholders for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.

The Board of Directors, including the Directors who are not "interested" persons, unanimously recommends that stockholders of the Fund vote FOR each of the nominees for election as a Class I Director. 
SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND OTHER STOCKHOLDER

[BEGIN TABLE]
*  "Audit-Related Fees" include services related to consents, comfort letter and bring down letters in  conjunction with the public offering of the Fund's common stock.  
**  "Tax Fees" are those fees related to KPMG's tax consulting services, including primarily the  review of the Fund's income tax returns.  
***  "All Other Fees" include the aggregate fees billed for products and services provided by KPMG, other  than the reported services.  
[END TABLE]
The Fund's Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by KPMG to the Fund, and all non-audit services to be provided by the independent accountants to the Manager and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Manager ("Affiliates") that provides on-going services to the Fund, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. Alternatively, the Audit Committee also may delegate pre-approval to one of its members subject to subsequent reporting to the Audit Committee. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, all of the audit and non-audit services described above for which KPMG billed the Fund fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee as required. 
The aggregate non-audit fees billed by KPMG for services rendered to the Fund and rendered to the Manager or its Affiliates that provide ongoing services to the Fund for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 is $0.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, in combination require the Fund's Directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Fund's common stock, as well as PGIM Investments and certain of its affiliated persons, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"). Such persons and entities are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Fund with copies of all such filings. In 2018 it was determined that Forms 4 or 5 for Messrs. Michael Collins and Daniel Thorogood, who served as two of the Fund's portfolio managers, had not been filed as required for certain transactions in Fund shares effected in 2013 and 2014. The applicable Form 4 and Form 5 filings were prepared and filed on EDGAR in March, 2018. Based   solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons, the Fund believes that during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 that all other such filing requirements were met with respect to the Fund. 
Credit Agreement 
On January 15, 2013, the Fund entered into a committed lending agreement with a financial institution. As of July 31, 2018, the Fund had $258,000,000 outstanding under the agreement. 
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 
Stockholders represented by properly authorized proxies with respect to which a vote is withheld, or for which a broker does not vote, will be treated as stockholders that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum, but will not constitute a vote "FOR" any proposal and will have the effect of a vote against the election of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement. 
5% Beneficial Ownership 
At December 14, 2018, to the knowledge of management, other than as noted below, there were no registered stockholders who owned of record or owned beneficially more than 5% of the Fund's outstanding stock. 
As of the close of business on December 14, 2018, Cede & Co., a nominee for participants in the Depository Trust Company, held of record 40,918,161 shares, equal to approximately 99.99% of the Fund's outstanding shares. 
Based on Schedule 13G filed jointly by the Charger Corporation, First Trust Portfolios L.P. and First Trust Advisors L.P. as of December 31, 2017 certain unit investment trusts sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. (of which The Charger Corporation is the General Partner) beneficially owned 2,149,155 shares equal to 5.25% of the Fund's outstanding shares. 
Based on Schedule 13G filed jointly by Saba Capital Management, L.P. and Boaz R. Weinstein, Saba Capital Management and Mr. Weinstein as of November 30, 2018 beneficially owned 2,215,768 shares equal to 5.41% of the Fund's outstanding shares.

The function of the Audit Committee is oversight; it is management's responsibility to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control over financial reporting, and the independent accountants' responsibility to plan and carry out a proper audit. Specifically, Fund management is responsible for: (1) preparation, presentation and integrity of the Fund's financial statements; (2) maintenance of appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies; (3) maintenance of internal control over financial reporting and other procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and related laws and regulations; and (4) maintenance of procedures for the reporting to the Audit Committee of material findings by the internal audit department of Prudential Financial, Inc. relating to the operations of the Fund and/or its advisers or service providers. The independent accountants are responsible for planning and carrying out an audit consistent with applicable legal and professional standards and terms of their engagement letter. The independent accountants are accountable to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, as representatives of the shareholders. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have the ultimate authority and responsibility to retain and terminate the Fund's independent accountants (subject, if applicable, to shareholder ratification). Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Fund's service providers, including the independent accountants. 
The review of a Fund's financial statements by the Audit Committee is not an audit, nor does the Committee's review substitute for the responsibilities of the Fund's management for preparing, or the independent accountants for auditing, the financial statements. In fulfilling their responsibilities hereunder, it is recognized that members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Fund or management and, in serving on this Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors. As such, it is not the responsibility of the Committee or its members to conduct audits, to determine that the financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. 
In discharging their duties, the members of the Audit Committee are entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers of the Fund whom the Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; (3) a Board committee of which the Director is not a member; and (4) representations made by management as to any information technology, internal audit and other non-audit services provided by the independent accountants to the Fund. "Management" means the Fund's investment adviser or administrator, acting through its officers and employees, not the Fund's officers as such. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
IV.  Duties and Powers of the Audit Committee  
[END TABLE]
To carry out its purposes, the Audit Committee shall have the following duties and powers: 
(a)        to select or retain independent accountants to annually audit and provide their opinion on the Fund's financial statements, and recommend to those Board members who are not "interested persons" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) to ratify the selection or retention; 
(b)        to terminate, as appropriate, the independent accountants; 
(c)        to monitor the independence and capabilities of the independent accountants;

(j)        to recommend to the Board of Directors the appointment of the Fund's principal accounting officer and principal financial officer;

(m)        to review and discuss the Fund's annual audited financial statements, and, to the extent required by applicable law or regulations, the Fund's interim financial statements, with Fund management and the Fund's independent accountants, including the significant assumptions underlying highly subjective estimates and any accounting adjustments arising from the audit that were noted or proposed by the independent accountants but were not implemented (as immaterial or otherwise); reviewing the Fund's specific disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," to review the independent accountants' opinion on the Fund's financial statements; and to review any matters relating to the other information in documents containing the audited financial statements of the Fund; 
(n)        to review with the independent accountants all matters required to be communicated to the Audit Committee by the independent accountants including, but not limited to: (a) the results of the most recent inspection of the independent accountants by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including the independent accountants' response to any identified accounting deficiencies; (b) the extent to which the independent accountants intend to use the internal auditors of the Funds or Management in the audit; (c) any 
A-3 
 complaints or concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters that have come to the attention of the independent accountants; (d) the detection of fraud or illegal acts; (e) any violations or possible violations of laws or regulations; (f) any significant issues or other contentious matters for which the independent accountants have consulted outside the engagement team; (g) any disagreements or difficulties with management; (h) any significant transactions that are outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise appear to be unusual; (i) any significant accounting policies in controversial areas or areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or diversity in practice; (j) any consultations by management with other accountants, information about other accounting firms or other persons performing audit procedures, and the basis upon which the independent accountants can serve as principal auditor if significant parts of the audit will be performed by other auditors; and (k) any other matters required to be discussed pursuant to all applicable PCAOB or other applicable standards or other matters arising out of the audit that are significant to the oversight of the Fund's financial reporting process;

Process for Review of Possible Conflicts 
From time to time, an Independent or Non-Management Director may be asked to serve on the board of a company or investment vehicle or may otherwise have an opportunity to be involved in the financial services industry or with a company or group that is involved with the financial services industry. Subject to confidentiality considerations, such Director will notify the Chair of the Committee and Independent Directors' counsel as promptly as possible if any of these situations should arise. The Committee Chair will work with counsel to coordinate appropriate communications with management, the Board Chair and the Committee. At the conclusion of this process (and during the process, as appropriate), the Committee Chair will communicate with the Director. For purposes of this paragraph, "involvement with the financial services industry" includes any public pronouncements (whether written or oral) pertaining to any aspect of the industry (including, but not limited to, investments, fees, administrative matters and governance practices). 
External Communications 
Consistent with the penultimate bullet point in the Board Chair "Responsibilities" section of this Handbook, Independent and Non-Management Directors should refrain from all communications with the media or otherwise relating to the Board, the Funds, and Prudential Financial, Inc., (or its affiliates). Directors should refer all communications to the Board Chair or counsel to the Independent Directors. "Communications" for purposes of this paragraph means all forms of communications (written or oral) and includes, but is not limited to, interactions with the media, professional or academic publications and organizations and/or all forms of social media. Only the Board and Nominating & Governance Committee Chairs can make exceptions to this policy, after consulting with counsel to the Independent Directors.
