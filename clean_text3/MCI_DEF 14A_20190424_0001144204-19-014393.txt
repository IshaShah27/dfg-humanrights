Joint Proxy Statement 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees of Barings Corporate Investors ("MCI") and of Barings Participation Investors ("MPV" and, together with MCI, each is referred to separately as the "Trust" and collectively as the "Trusts") for use at the Annual Meeting of its Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting" or "Meeting"), to be held in the Sky Room of Barings LLC ("Barings"), 300 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202, on Wednesday, April 24, 2019, at 1:00 p.m., Eastern Time. Unless otherwise indicated, all information in this Proxy Statement and each Proposal ("Proposal") apply separately to each Trust. 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying letter to shareholders from the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and proxy card(s) are being mailed on or about March 18, 2019, to shareholders of record on February 27, 2019, the "record date." Each Trust's principal business office is c/o Barings LLC, 300 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28202. 
Holders of the shares of beneficial interest of each Trust ("shares") of record at the close of business on February 27, 2019 will be entitled to one vote per share on all business of the Meeting and any adjournments thereof. There were 20,120,306 shares of MCI outstanding and 10,543,007 shares of MPV outstanding on the record date. The Trusts, to the best of their knowledge, are not aware of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of each Trust. However, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company ("MassMutual"), the ultimate parent company of Barings, may be deemed a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of MCI by reason of it owning a $30,000,000 Senior Fixed Rate Convertible Note due November 15, 2027 (the "MCI Note") issued by MCI. Similarly, MassMutual may be deemed a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of MPV by reason of it owning a $15,000,000 Senior Fixed Rate Convertible Note due December 13, 2023 issued by MPV (the "MPV Note and, together with "MCI Note," each a "Note" and collectively the "Notes"). MassMutual, at its option, can convert the principal amount of each Note into shares. The dollar amount of principal would be converted into an equivalent dollar amount of shares based upon the average price of the shares for ten business days prior to the notice of conversion. 
The Trusts have engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to provide shareholder meeting services, including tabulation and tracking. Should you have any questions about this Proxy Statement, please contact the Trusts by calling (toll-free) 1-866-399-1516.

The following provides an overview of the considerations that led the Board to conclude that each individual serving as a Trustee or nominee for Trustee of each Trust should so serve. The current members of the Board have joined the Board at different points in time since 2003. Generally, no one factor was decisive in the original selection of an individual to join the Board. Among the attributes common to all Trustees is their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with each Trust's investment adviser, counsel and independent auditors, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. In recommending the election or appointment of the current Board members as Trustees, the Nominating Committee generally considered (i) the educational, business and professional experience of each individual; (ii) the individual's record of service as a director or trustee of public or private organizations; and (iii) how the individual's skills, experience and attributes would contribute to an appropriate mix of relevant skills and experience on the Board. The Nominating Committee also considered that during their service as members of the Board of Trustees of each Trust, the Trustees have demonstrated a high level of diligence and commitment to the interests of the Trusts' shareholders and the ability to work effectively and collegially with other members of the Board. 
The following summarizes each Trustee's or nominee for Trustee's professional experience and additional considerations that contributed to the Board's conclusion that each individual should serve on the Board.

Share Ownership of Trustees and Officers 
As of February 1, 2019, the Trustees and Officers of each Trust individually beneficially owned less than two percent (2%) of each of MCI's and MPV's outstanding shares and as a group beneficially owned 1.59% of MCI's outstanding shares and 0.29% of MPV's outstanding shares. This information is based on information furnished by each Trustee and Officer and by the Compliance Department of Barings. Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Also, as of February 1, 2019, Barings, the investment adviser to each Trust, beneficially owned 1.09% of the outstanding shares of MCI and 1.39% of the outstanding shares of MPV. 
Members of each Board historically have invested in one or both of the Trusts, as is consistent with their individual financial goals. In October 2010, this policy was formalized through adoption of a requirement that each Independent Trustee invest one year's worth of fees received for serving as Trustee of the Trusts (excluding committee fees) in shares of one or both of the Trusts. Investments in the name of family members or entities controlled by a Trustee constitute Trust holdings of such Trustee for purposes of this policy, and a three-year phase-in period applies to such investment requirements for Trustees and newly elected Trustees. In implementing such policy, a Board member's Trust holdings existing on October 22, 2010 were valued as of such date with subsequent investments valued at cost. ​
The table below sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership* of each Trust's shares by each Trustee and the Officers beneficially owning shares based on the market value of such shares as of February 1, 2019.

​
Required Vote 
If a quorum is present at the Meeting, the two nominees for election as Trustees who receive a plurality vote, meaning the greatest number of affirmative votes cast by shareholders, will be elected as Trustees. 
THE BOARDS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EACH TRUST VOTE TO ELECT EACH OF THE NOMINEES AS TRUSTEE OF EACH TRUST. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board for each Trust currently consists of seven Trustees, five of whom are Independent Trustees. As discussed below, four of the standing committees of the Board, to which the Board has delegated certain authority and oversight responsibilities, are comprised exclusively of Independent Trustees. 
Mr. Noreen, an "interested person" of each Trust, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, serves as Chairman of each Board. Mr. Noreen presides at meetings of each Board and acts as a liaison with service providers, officers, and other Trustees generally between meetings, and performs such other functions as may be requested by each Board from time to time. The Independent Trustees have not designated a lead Independent Trustee, but the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Brown, generally acts as chairman of meetings or executive sessions of the Independent Trustees, and when appropriate, represents the views of the Independent Trustees to management. The Board of each Trust reviews its 
13​
​
leadership structure periodically and believes that the leadership structure is appropriate to enable each Board to exercise its oversight of each Trust. Each Board also believes that its structure, including the active role of the Independent Trustees, facilitates an efficient flow of information concerning the management of each Trust to the Independent Trustees. 
Each Board provides oversight of the services provided by Barings, including risk management activities. In addition, each committee of each Board provides oversight of Barings' risk activities with respect to the particular activities within the committee's purview. In the course of providing oversight, the Board and relevant committees for each Trust receive a wide range of reports on the Trusts' activities, including each Trust's investment portfolio, the compliance of the Trusts with applicable laws, and the Trusts' financial accounting and reporting. The Board and Audit Committee for each Trust meet periodically with the Trusts' Chief Compliance Officer regarding the compliance of the Trusts with federal securities laws and the Trusts' internal compliance policies and procedures. In addition, both the Audit Committee and the full Board of each Trust regularly review information and materials concerning risks specific to the Trusts and Barings, including presentations by various officers of the Trusts, investment personnel for the Trusts, Barings, Barings and MassMutual internal audit, the independent auditors for the Trusts (KPMG LLP) and Counsel to the Trusts. 
Information Concerning Committees and Meetings of the Board of Trustees 
Each Board has an Audit Committee, a Joint Transactions Committee, a Governance Committee and a Nominating Committee. 
The Audit Committee of each Trust is comprised exclusively of Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and operates pursuant to a written Audit Committee Charter, which is available on each Trust's website at www.barings.com/assets/user/media/MCI_MPV_Audit_Committee_Chart.pdf. A print copy of the Audit Committee Charter may also be obtained by calling, toll-free, 1-866-399-1516. The present members of the Audit Committee of each Trust are Michael H. Brown (Chairman), Barbara M. Ginader, Edward P. Grace, II, Susan B. Sweeney and Maleyne M. Syracuse. Each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an "Independent Trustee" under the current listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "Listing Standards") and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In accordance with the SEC's rules implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and upon due consideration of the qualifications of each member of each Trust's Audit Committee, each Board designated Mr. Brown as the Trust's Audit Committee Financial Expert. 
In accordance with the standards set forth in the Audit Committee Charter of each Trust, the Audit Committee is responsible for: oversight matters; financial statement and disclosure oversight matters; matters related to the hiring, retention, and oversight of each Trust's independent accountants; certain accounting and audit  ​
related oversight matters; and certain other matters as set forth in the Audit Committee Charter. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee held eight meetings. 
The Joint Transactions Committee of each Trust is comprised of all Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. This Committee reviews certain joint investment transactions between each Trust and Barings pursuant to the conditions set forth in the Trusts' SEC exemptive order under Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder. This Committee acts primarily by written consent and during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, Committee members approved 53 new or follow-on investments for MCI and 51 new or follow-on investments for MPV. The Committee also met four times during the year in conjunction with meetings of each Trust's Board. 
The Governance Committee of each Trust is currently comprised of all Independent Trustees and is chaired by Maleyne M. Syracuse. The Governance Committee considers, evaluates and makes recommendations to the Board of each Trust with respect to the structure, membership and function of the Board and the Committees thereof, including the compensation of the Trustees. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Governance Committee held two meetings. 
The Nominating Committee of each Trust is comprised of all Independent Trustees and is chaired by Edward P. Grace, III. A current copy of each Trust's Nominating Committee Charter can be found on each Trust's website at www.barings.com/assets/user/media/nominating-committee-charter-mci-mpv.pdf. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Nominating Committee held one meeting. 
The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and nominating individuals to serve as Trustees who are not "interested persons" of each Trust ("Independent Trustees"). The Nominating Committee Charter contemplates that all nominees for Independent Trustees have a college degree or, in the judgment of the Committee, equivalent business experience. In addition, the Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, giving such weight to any individual factor(s) as it deems appropriate, including but not limited to: availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on each Board; relevant industry and related experience; educational background; depth and breadth of financial expertise; and an assessment of the candidate's ability, judgment, expertise, reputation, and integrity. In the case of a shareholder recommended candidate, the Committee may also consider any other facts and circumstances attendant to such shareholder submission as may be deemed appropriate by the Committee. Different factors may assume greater or lesser significance at particular times, in light of the Board's present composition and the Committee's (or the Board's) perceptions about future issues and needs. 
When each Board has or expects to have a vacancy for an Independent Trustee, the Nominating Committee will consider candidates recommended by each Trust's 
15​
​
current Trustees; each Trust's shareholders; each Trust's officers; each Trust's investment adviser; and any other source the Committee deems to be appropriate. Shareholder recommendations to fill vacancies on the Board for Independent Trustees must be submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Nominating Committee Charter, which requires that shareholder recommendations be timely received, and contain biographical and other necessary information regarding the candidate that would be required for the Trust to meet its disclosure obligations under the proxy rules. The Nominating Committee will evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by shareholders in the same manner as it evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. 
During the past fiscal year, each Board of Trustees held five regular meetings (one of which was held by means of a telephone conference call) and two special meetings (held by means of a telephone conference call). During the past fiscal year, each Trustee attended at least 75% of the Board and applicable Committee meetings on which s/he served for each Trust. 
Transactions with and Remuneration of Officers and Trustees 
Pursuant to the Investment Services Contract between MCI and Barings and the Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Contract between MPV and Barings (each a "Contract"), Barings paid the compensation and expenses of the Trusts' officers and of all Trustees of the Trusts who were "interested persons" of each Trust or officers or employees of Barings or MassMutual. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Trustees who are not officers or employees of Barings or MassMutual received an annual retainer paid by MCI of $34,500 and by MPV of  $23,000. Each Trust also paid an additional annual retainer fee to the Chairman of the Audit Committee in the amount of  $3,500. Trustees of MCI also received a fee of  $3,450 and Trustees of MPV received a fee of  $2,300 for each meeting of each Board which they attend ($1,725 and $1,150, respectively, for each meeting conducted by telephone conference call). Members of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Governance Committee of each Trust received an additional fee of  $2,100 from MCI and $1,350 from MPV per meeting attended, including meetings conducted by telephone conference call. In October 2018, the Governance Committee and Board reviewed the Trustee compensation structure and unanimously voted to approve an increase to certain fees paid to the Trustees who are not officers or employees of Barings or MassMutual. Beginning January 1, 2019, Trustees who are not officers or employees of Barings or MassMutual receive an annual retainer paid by MCI of  $36,250 and by MPV of  $24,200. Each Trust also pays an additional annual retainer fee to the Chairman of the Audit Committee in the amount of  $3,700. Trustees of MCI also receive a fee of  $3,650 and Trustees of MPV receive a fee of  $2,450 for each meeting of each Board which they attend ($1,825 and $1,225, respectively, for each meeting conducted by telephone conference call). Members of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Governance Committee of each Trust receive an additional fee of  $2,250 from MCI and $1,450 from MPV per meeting attended,  ​
including meetings conducted by telephone conference call. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the aggregate direct remuneration to these Trustees and reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses paid was approximately $386,375 for MCI and $256,000 for MPV.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT OF EACH TRUST 
Each Trust's Audit Committee oversees the Trust's financial reporting process on behalf of each Trust's Board of Trustees and operates under a written Charter adopted by each Trust's Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee meets with each Trust's management ("Management") and independent registered public accountants and reports the results of its activities to each Trust's Board of Trustees. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. In connection with each Committee's and independent registered accountant's responsibilities, Management advised that each Trust's financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
17​
​
Accordingly, each Trust's Audit Committee has: 
■
Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with Management and KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), each Trust's independent registered public accountants; 
​
■
Discussed with KPMG those matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 16 (Communications with Audit Committees); and 
​
■
Received the written disclosure and the letter from KPMG required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communications with Audit Committee Concerning Independence) and has discussed with KPMG its independence. 
​
Each Trust's Audit Committee has also reviewed the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG for 2017 and 2018 for each Trust and for the non-audit services provided to Barings and Barings' parent, MassMutual. As part of this review, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of such non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, each Trust's Audit Committee presents this Report to each Trust's Board of Trustees and recommends that each Trust's Board of Trustees (1) include the December 31, 2018 audited financial statements in the Annual Report to shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and (2) file such Annual Report with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. 
Each Trust's Audit Committee appointed the firm of KPMG as the Trust's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and, in connection therewith, KPMG will prepare all of each Trust's tax returns for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
SUBMITTED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF EACH TRUST'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
February 26, 2019 ​
THE TRUSTS' INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
KPMG audited the financial statements of each Trust, Barings, and MassMutual for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. KPMG's audit report for each Trust contained no qualifications or modifications. A KPMG representative is expected to be present at the upcoming Annual Meeting. This representative shall have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so, and it is expected that such representative will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. As noted above, KPMG will audit each Trust's 2019 financial statements and prepare each Trust's 2019 Federal and state tax returns.

December 31, 2018 amount is estimated. 
​
The category "Audit-Related Fees" reflects fees billed by KPMG for various non-audit and non-tax services rendered to the Trusts, Barings and MassMutual, such as consulting and agreed upon procedures reports. Preparation of Federal, state and local income tax and tax compliance work are representative of the fees reported in the "Tax Fees" category. The category "All Other Fees" represents fees billed by KPMG for consulting rendered to Barings and MassMutual. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its implementing regulations allow each Trust's Audit Committee to establish a pre-approval policy for certain services rendered by the Trust's independent accountants. During 2018, each Trust's Audit Committee 
19​
​
approved all of the services rendered to the Trust by KPMG and did not rely on such a pre-approval policy for any such services. 
The 2017 fees billed represent final 2017 amounts, which may differ from the preliminary figures available as of the publication date of the Trusts' 2018 Proxy Statement and includes, among other things, fees for services that may not have been billed as of the publication date of the Trusts' 2018 Proxy Statement, but are now properly included in the 2018 fees billed to each Trust, Barings and MassMutual. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board of each Trust knows of no business to be brought before the Meeting other than as set forth above. If, however, any other matters properly come before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy card to vote proxies on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING PROXIES AND THE MEETING 
Manner of Voting Proxies 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be counted by persons appointed by each Trust to act as election inspectors for the Meeting. The election inspectors will count the total number of votes cast "for" approval of the Proposals for purposes of determining whether sufficient affirmative votes have been cast. All proxies received, including proxies that reflect (i) broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (a) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (b) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter), (ii) abstentions or (iii) the withholding of authority to vote for a nominee for election as Trustee, will be counted as shares that are present on a particular matter for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes shall be a quorum for the transaction of business for each Proposal. With respect to Proposal 1, neither abstentions nor broker non-votes, if any, will have an effect on the outcome of Proposal 1. 
Shareholders of each Trust are entitled to one vote, on each matter on which the shareholder is entitled to vote, for each share of the Trust that such shareholder owns at the close of business on February 27, 2019. Each fractional share is entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. 
Instructions for Voting Proxies 
The giving of a proxy will not affect a shareholder's right to vote in person should the shareholder decide to attend the Meeting. To vote by mail, please mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card(s) following the instructions printed on the card. Please refer to your proxy card(s) for instructions for voting by telephone or internet.  ​
Revocation of Proxies 
Any person giving a proxy has the power to revoke it by mail or in person at any time prior to its exercise by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation to the Trust. All properly executed and unrevoked proxies received in time for the Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein.
