LINKING PAY WITH PERFORMANCE
Pay for Performance Culture
Our executive compensation programs reflect the belief that the amount earned by our executives must, to a significant extent, depend on achieving rigorous Company, business unit and individual performance objectives designed to enhance shareholder value. The illustration below shows the payouts as a percentage of target under our performance-based short- and long-term incentive programs and total return to shareholders over the last five years. In 2015, we changed the length of our performance-based long-term award periods from four to three years. As a result, two long-term performance periods ended on December 31, 2017 and awards for each period were earned at 25% of target. In 2016, we changed the long-term incentive plan performance criteria from Adjusted Earnings per Share growth and Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital (weighted equally) to relative Total Shareholder Return. The first TSR-based award period began on January 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018. More information about our short- and long-term incentive programs can be found on page 31.
The illustration below shows the correlation between pay and the performance we are delivering to our shareholders.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We design our executive compensation plans and programs to help us attract, motivate, reward, and retain highly qualified executives who are capable of creating and sustaining value for our shareholders over the long term.

Say On Pay 2018 Advisory Vote 
The Board of Directors is committed to understanding the views of our shareholders by providing an opportunity to endorse our executive compensation through an advisory, non-binding vote. In 2018, our shareholders approved our executives' compensation by a vote of 94%.
The Committee will continue to review our compensation programs each year in light of the annual "say-on-pay" voting results and feedback we receive from our shareholders.

HOW NOMINEES ARE CHOSEN
Director Nomination Process 
The Governance Committee of the Board, composed entirely of directors who meet the independence standards of the Board of Directors and the New York Stock Exchange, is responsible for overseeing the process of nominating individuals to stand for election as directors. The Governance Committee charter is available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance.
The Governance Committee will consider any director candidates recommended by our shareholders, consistent with the process used for all candidates. To learn how to submit a shareholder recommendation, see below under "Shareholder Recommendations of Director Candidates."
The Governance Committee chair reviews all potential director candidates in consultation with the Chairman, typically with the assistance of a professional search firm retained by the Committee. The Committee decides whether to recommend one or more candidates to the Board of Directors for nomination. Candidates who are ultimately nominated by the Board stand for election by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. Between annual general meetings, nominees may also be elected by the Board itself. Olivier Leonetti was identified as a candidate for the Board of Directors by a third-party search firm retained by the Governance Committee and was recommended as a nominee to the Board by the Committee.
Director Qualifications and Board Diversity 
The Board of Directors recognizes the value of nominating director candidates who bring diverse opinions, perspectives, skills, experiences, backgrounds, and orientations to Board deliberations. The Governance Committee uses a rigorous process for identifying and evaluating director nominees. In order to be recommended by the Committee, a candidate must have the following minimum qualifications, as described in the Board of Directors Governance Policies: personal ability, integrity, intelligence, relevant business background, independence, expertise in areas of importance to our objectives, and a commitment to our corporate mission. In addition, the Committee looks for individuals with specific qualifications so that the Board as a whole has diversity in experience, international perspective, background, expertise, skills, age, gender, and ethnicity. These specific qualifications may vary from year to year, depending upon the composition of the Board at that time.
The Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that director qualifications are met and Board balance and diversity objectives are considered during its review of director candidates. The Committee annually evaluates the extent to which these goals are satisfied as part of its yearly assessment of the skills and experience of each of the current directors using a director skills matrix and a director evaluation process. 
The director evaluation process includes self-evaluation, input from the Chairman and CEO, and input from the chairs of each Board committee. A self-evaluation is designed to elicit each director's thoughts about his or her contributions in light of the needs of the Board and the Company. The evaluation is focused on opportunities for further improvement in effectiveness, indication of preferences in future Board committee rotation, identification of board matter educational priorities, and requests for Company specific orientation information. The director evaluation process is typically conducted during the October and February Governance Committee and Board meetings. At the conclusion of the evaluation process, the Chair of the Governance Committee provides specific feedback to the individual directors relative to further performance improvement, educational opportunities, and other counsel.
Upon completion of the skills matrix and the evaluation process, the Governance Committee identifies areas of director knowledge and experience that may benefit the Board in the future and uses that information as part of the director search and nomination effort.
The Board of Directors Governance Policies are available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance.

Shareholder Recommendations of Director Candidates 
The Governance Committee will consider director candidates who are recommended to it in writing by any Eaton shareholder who submits a recommendation by following the procedures required under our Articles of Association for nominating director candidates. Accordingly, any shareholder wishing to recommend an individual as a nominee for election at the 2020 annual general meeting should send a signed letter of recommendation to the following address: Eaton Corporation plc, Attention: Company Secretary, Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2. Recommendation letters must be received no earlier than November 15, 2019 and no later than December 15, 2019, and must include the reasons for the recommendation, the full name and address of each proposed nominee, and a brief biographical history setting forth past and present directorships, past and present positions held, occupations and civic activities. The recommendation letter should be accompanied by a written statement from the proposed nominee consenting to be nominated and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a director.
Any shareholder wishing to recommend an individual as a nominee for election as a director must also describe in a detailed writing any financial agreement, arrangement or understanding between the nominee and any party other than the Company relating to such nominee's potential service as a director, and details of any compensation or other payment received from any such third party relating to such nominee's potential service as a director.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board of Directors Governance Policies provide that all of our non-employee directors should be independent. The listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange state that no director can qualify as independent unless the Board of Directors affirmatively determines that he or she has no material relationship with the Company. Additional, and more stringent, standards of independence are required of Audit Committee members. Our annual proxy statement discloses the Board's determination as to the independence of the Audit Committee members and of all non-employee directors. For our current directors, we describe these determinations here.
As permitted by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Board of Directors has determined that certain categories of relationships between a non-employee director and the Company will be treated as immaterial for purposes of determining a director's independence. These "categorical" standards are included in the Board of Directors' independence criteria. The independence criteria for non-employee directors and members of the Audit Committee are available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance.
Because director independence may be influenced by their use of Company aircraft and other Company-paid transportation, the Board has adopted a policy on this subject.
In their review of director independence, the Board of Directors and its Governance Committee have considered the following circumstances:
Directors T. Bluedorn, C. Connor, G. Page, and D. Thompson serve or have served as officers or employees of companies that had purchases and/or sales of property or services with us during 2018. In each case, the amounts of the purchases and sales met the Board's categorical standard for immateriality; that is, they were less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the annual consolidated gross revenues of the director's company. Mr. Bluedorn is Chairman and CEO of Lennox International Inc., which purchased approximately $344,000 worth of Eaton products and sold approximately $4,000 worth of products to Eaton during 2018. Mr. Connor is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Sherwin-Williams Company, which purchased approximately $40,000 worth of Eaton products and sold approximately $724,000 worth of products to Eaton during 2018. Mr. Page is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cargill, which purchased approximately $395,000 worth of Eaton products and sold approximately $16,542,000 worth of products to Eaton during 2018. In addition, Cargill paid approximately $699,000 in royalty payments to the Company.  Ms. Thompson is the retired Chief Executive Officer of Drax Group plc, which purchased approximately $131,000 in good or services from Eaton in 2018. 
The use of our aircraft and other Company-paid transportation by all non-employee directors is consistent with the Board policy on that subject.
Back to Contents 
After reviewing the circumstances described above (which are the only relevant circumstances known to the Board of Directors), the Board has affirmatively determined that none of our non-employee directors, nor director nominee Olivier Leonetti, has a material relationship with the Company other than in his or her capacity as a director, and that all of our non-employee directors qualify as independent under the Board's independence criteria and the New York Stock Exchange standards. All members of the Audit, Compensation and Organization, Finance, and Governance Committees qualify as independent under the standards described above.
The Board also has affirmatively determined that each member of the Audit Committee — C. Connor, D. McCoy, S. Pianalto, G. Smith and D. Thompson — meets not only our Board's independence criteria but the special independence standards required by the New York Stock Exchange and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Review of Related Person Transactions 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy to identify and evaluate "related person transactions," that is, transactions between us and any of our executive officers, directors, director nominees, 5%-plus security holders or members of their "immediate families," or organizations where they or their family members serve as officers or employees. The Board policy calls for the disinterested members of the Board's Governance Committee to conduct an annual review of all such transactions. At the Committee's direction, a survey is conducted annually of all transactions involving related persons, and the Committee reviews the results in February of each year. The Committee is responsible for determining whether any "related person transaction" (i) poses a significant risk of impairing, or appearing to impair, the judgment or objectivity of the individuals involved; (ii) poses a significant risk of impairing, or appearing to impair, the independence of an outside director or director nominee; or (iii) has terms that are less favorable to us than those generally available in the marketplace. Depending upon the Committee's assessment of these risks, the Committee will respond appropriately. In addition, as required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any transactions that are material to a related person are disclosed in our proxy statement.
As discussed above, the Governance Committee is charged with reviewing issues involving director independence and all related persons transactions. The Committee and the Board have determined that since the beginning of 2018 the only related person transactions were those described above under the heading "Director Independence" and that none of our executive officers engaged in any such transactions. The Committee also concluded that none of the related person transactions posed risks to the Company in any of the areas described above.

Committee Charters and Policies 
The Board committee charters are available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance.
In addition to the Board of Directors Governance Policies, certain other policies relating to corporate governance matters are adopted from time to time by Board committees, or by the Board itself upon recommendation of the committees.
BOARD MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Board of Directors held five meetings in 2018. Each of the directors attended at least 90% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served. The average rate of attendance for all directors was 95%.
The policy of the Board of Directors is that all directors should attend the annual general meetings of shareholders. At the 2018 annual general meeting held April 25, 2018, all members of the Board at that time were in attendance.
BOARD GOVERNANCE POLICIES
The Board revised the Board of Directors Governance Policies most recently in July 2018, as recommended by the Governance Committee of the Board. The revised Governance Policies are available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance.
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF THE NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
The Board's policy is that the non-employee directors, all of whom qualify as "independent" under the criteria of the Board of Directors and the New York Stock Exchange, meet in Executive Session at each regular Board meeting, without the Chairman or other members of management present, to discuss topics they deem appropriate. As described more fully in "Leadership Structure" below, the Lead Director chairs these Executive Sessions.
At each meeting of the Audit, Compensation and Organization, Finance, and Governance Committees, the Committee members (all of whom qualify as independent) hold an Executive Session, without any members of our management present, to discuss topics they deem appropriate.
Back to Contents 
LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Our governance structure follows a successful leadership model under which the Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Corporation also serves as Chairman of the Board of the Company. Recognizing that different leadership models may work well for other companies at different times depending upon individual circumstances, we believe that our Company has been well served by the combined Chief Executive Officer and Chairman leadership structure and that this approach has continued to be highly effective with the addition of a Lead Director. We believe we have benefited greatly from having a Chairman who sets the tone and direction for the Company while also having the primary responsibility as Chief Executive Officer for managing Eaton's day-to-day operations, and allowing the Board to carry out its strategic, governance, oversight and decision-making responsibilities with the equal involvement of each director.
Our Board is composed of independent directors, except for our Chairman, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Fearon. Of our 10 non-employee directors, five are currently serving or have served as a chief executive officer of a publicly traded company. The Audit, Compensation and Organization, Finance, and Governance Committees are chaired by independent directors. Our Chairman has benefited from the extensive leadership experience represented on our Board of Directors.
The Board evaluates the leadership structure annually, and it will continue to do so as circumstances change, including when a new Chief Executive Officer is elected. In its February 2019 annual evaluation, the Board concluded that the current leadership structure — under which the Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Corporation serves as Chairman of the Board of the Company, our Board committees are chaired by independent directors, and a Lead Director assumes specific responsibilities on behalf of the independent directors — remains the optimal board leadership structure for our Company and our shareholders at the present time.
Lead Director
Christopher M. Connor, who has served on Eaton's Board since 2006, was first elected Lead Director by our independent directors in 2016. The Lead Director has specific responsibilities, including chairing meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present (including Executive Sessions of the Board), approving the agenda and schedule for Board meetings on behalf of the independent directors, approving information sent to the Board, serving as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, and being available for consultation and direct communications with shareholders and other Company stakeholders. The Lead Director has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors and to retain outside advisors who report directly to the Board of Directors. The Lead Director's performance is assessed annually by the Board in a process led by the Chair of the Governance Committee, and the position of Lead Director is elected annually by our independent directors.
OVERSIGHT OF RISK MANAGEMENT
Management continually monitors the material risks facing the Company, including strategic risk, financial risk, operational risk, and legal and compliance risk. The Board of Directors has chosen to retain overall responsibility for risk assessment and oversight at the Board level in light of the interrelated nature of the elements of risk, rather than delegating this responsibility to a Board committee. The Board is responsible for overseeing the strategic planning process and reviewing and monitoring management's execution of the corporate and business plan. As described below, the Board receives assistance from certain of its committees for the identification and monitoring of those risks that are related to the committees' areas of focus as described in each committee charter. The Board and its committees exercise their risk oversight function by carefully evaluating the reports they receive from management and by making inquiries of management with respect to areas of particular interest to the Board.
The Audit Committee considers risks related to internal controls, disclosure, financial reporting and legal and compliance matters. Among other processes, the Audit Committee meets regularly in closed-door sessions with our internal and external auditors and senior leaders of Eaton Corporation, including the senior members of the Finance function, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and the Senior Vice President-Global Ethics and Compliance. As described more fully in the section entitled "Relationship Between Compensation Plans and Risk" on page 39, the Compensation and Organization Committee reviews risks associated with the Company's compensation programs to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements for senior executives do not encourage inappropriate risk taking. The Governance Committee considers risks related to corporate governance, such as director independence and related person transactions, and risks associated with the environment, health and safety.

CODE OF ETHICS
We have a Code of Ethics that was approved by the Board of Directors. We provide training globally for all employees on our Code of Ethics. We require that all directors, officers and employees of the Company, our subsidiaries and affiliates, abide by our Code of Ethics, which is available on our website at www.eaton.com/governance. In addition, we will disclose on our website any waiver of or amendment to our Code of Ethics requiring disclosure under applicable rules.
COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD
The Board of Directors provides a process for shareholders and other interested parties to send communications to the Board, individual directors or the non-employee directors as a group. Shareholders and other interested parties may send such communications by mail or courier delivery addressed as follows:
Company Secretary Eaton Corporation plc  Eaton House 30 Pembroke Road Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2
Email messages to the directors may be sent to Board@eaton.com.
Generally, the Company Secretary forwards all such communications to the Lead Director. The Lead Director determines whether the communications should be forwarded to other members of the Board and forwards them accordingly. For communications addressed to a particular member of the Board, the Chair of a particular Board committee or the non-employee directors as a group, the Company Secretary forwards those communications directly to those individuals.
Alternatively, correspondence may be sent to:
Lead Director Eaton Corporation plc  Eaton House 30 Pembroke Road Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2
The Secretary maintains a log of all correspondence addressed to the Board and, except as noted below, forwards all communications to the interested directors. For example, correspondence on a financial topic would be sent to the Chair of the Finance or Audit Committees, and correspondence on governance topics to the Lead Director or Chair of the Governance Committee.
The Secretary makes periodic reports to the Governance Committee regarding correspondence from shareholders and other interested parties.
Derivative shareholder communications and demands for inspection of company records should be sent to the Secretary who will promptly disseminate such communications to the entire Board. The Board will consult with the General Counsel or his designee to determine appropriate action.
The directors have requested that communications that do not directly relate to their duties and responsibilities as our directors be excluded from distribution and deleted from email that they access directly. Such excluded items include "spam," advertisements, mass mailings, form letters and email campaigns that involve unduly large numbers of similar communications, solicitations for goods, services, employment or contributions, surveys and individual product inquiries or complaints. Additionally, communications that appear to be unduly hostile, intimidating, threatening, illegal or similarly inappropriate will be screened for omission. Any omitted or deleted communications will be made available to any director upon request.

Appointment of Independent Auditor and Authorization of Audit Committee to Set Auditor Remuneration
Shareholders are being asked to approve the appointment of our independent auditor and to authorize the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to set the auditor's remuneration. Appointment of the independent auditor and authorization of the Audit Committee to set its remuneration require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of ordinary shares represented at the annual general meeting in person or by proxy. The Audit Committee and the Board recommend that shareholders reappoint Ernst & Young as our independent auditor to audit our accounts for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and authorize the Audit Committee of the Board to set the auditor's remuneration.
A representative of Ernst & Young will be present at the annual general meeting to answer any questions concerning the independent auditor's areas of responsibility and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing: (1) the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (2) the independence, qualifications and performance of the Company's independent auditor, (3) the performance of the Company's internal auditors, and (4) the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Committee's specific responsibilities, as described in its charter, include the sole authority to appoint, terminate and compensate the Company's independent auditor, and to pre-approve all audit services and other permitted non-audit services to be provided to the Company by the independent auditor. The Committee is currently comprised of five directors, all of whom are independent under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Board of Directors' own independence criteria.
The Board of Directors amended the Committee's charter most recently on October 24, 2017. A copy of the charter is available on the Company's website at www.eaton.com/governance.
The Audit Committee has retained Ernst & Young as Eaton's independent auditor for 2019. Ernst & Young has been the independent auditor for the Company or its predecessor since 1923. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that due to Ernst & Young's deep knowledge of the Company and of the industries in which the Company operates, it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to continue retention of Ernst & Young to serve as Eaton's independent auditor.
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed, and has discussed with the Company's management and independent auditor, the Company's 2018 audited consolidated financial statements and the assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed by applicable auditing standards.
The Committee has received the written disclosures from Ernst & Young regarding their independence from the Company that are required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, has discussed with Ernst & Young their independence and has considered whether their provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with their independence. 
Back to Contents 
For 2018 and 2017, Ernst & Young's fees to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018  2017  
Audit Fees  $20.0 million  $20.6 million  
Includes Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 attest services        
Audit-Related Fees  $0.9 million  $0.2 million  
Includes business acquisitions and divestitures        
Tax Fees  $5.2 million  $3.6 million  
     Tax compliance services  $1.0 million  $1.0 million  
Tax advisory services  $4.2 million  $2.6 million  
All Other Fees  $0  $0  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee approved all of the services shown in the above three categories in accordance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval process. The Audit Committee did not approve any of the services shown in the above three categories through the use of the "de minimis" exception permitted by Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
The Audit Committee has adopted the following procedure for pre-approving audit services and other services to be provided by the Company's independent auditor: specific services are pre-approved from time to time by the Committee or by the Committee Chair on its behalf. As to any services approved by the Committee Chair, the approval is made in writing and is reported to the Committee at the following meeting of the Committee.
Based upon the Committee's reviews and discussions referred to above, and in reliance upon them, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for 2018 be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, and the Board has approved their inclusion.
Respectfully submitted to the Company's shareholders by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Advisory Approval of the Company's Executive Compensation 
We are asking our shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. Although this is an advisory vote, and therefore not binding on our Board of Directors, the Board and the Compensation and Organization Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs.
This say-on-pay vote is required under U.S. law, and we consider it to be a matter of good corporate governance. This vote takes place annually and the next advisory vote to approve the Company's executive compensation will occur at the 2020 annual general meeting.
As we explain in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows, our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to the success of our Company. Our programs reward our named executive officers for achieving specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, and also for increasing shareholder value.
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' COMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS
[BEGIN TABLE]
As part of our pay for performance culture, our executive compensation plans include the following:  Other features of these programs include:  
As part of our pay for performance culture, our executive compensation plans include the following:  Other features of these programs include:  
[END TABLE]
Our plans deliver awards below target, or none at all, when Company performance does not meet threshold levels.
Our executive incentive programs are intended to deliver awards at target when our performance aligns with our peer group median performance and awards exceeding 150% of target when our performance is at or above the top quartile of our peer group.
Our share ownership requirements range from one times base salary for our general managers to six times base salary for the Company's Chairman and CEO of Eaton Corporation.
Our incentive plan payouts are capped to prevent unintended windfalls.
Our compensation clawback policy allows us to recover incentive compensation in case of employee misconduct that causes the need for a material restatement of financial results.
We do not enter into employment contracts with any of our salaried U.S. employees, including the named executive officers.
The Compensation and Organization Committee continually reviews the compensation programs for named executive officers to ensure that they achieve the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our shareholders' interests and current market practices. All Committee members are independent directors committed to applying sound governance practices to compensation decisions.
We strongly encourage you to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows. It contains information about the extensive processes the Committee follows, and the factors it considers, when establishing performance and pay targets and approving actual payments from our short- and long-term performance-based incentive plans. The Committee's process includes reviewing a variety of reports and analyses such as market survey data, compensation tally sheets, compensation at peer companies, and reports from proxy advisory firms. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis also describes the structure of our compensation programs and the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers.
We believe that our executive compensation design and strategy is a critical factor in motivating our executives to seek innovative solutions that contribute to Eaton's continued success. We are therefore asking shareholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 annual general meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A), we discuss our pay for performance philosophy, our pay-setting process, the components of our executive compensation program, and the compensation of our named executive officers for 2018. We also explain our performance metrics in detail and review our executive compensation policies.
Please note that the use of "we," "us" or "our" throughout this CD&A refers to the Company, its subsidiaries or its management. In addition, the use of "Chairman and Chief Executive Officer" or "CEO" throughout this CD&A refers to Craig Arnold, Chairman of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Corporation. Similarly, the other four named executive officers were employees of an Eaton subsidiary as of December 31, 2018.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This section provides a summary of the performance metrics and actual results for the incentive plans in which our named executive officers and other executives participated for the year ending December 31, 2018. For 2018, our named executive officers are:
Craig Arnold, Chairman of the Company and Chief Executive Officer
Richard H. Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer
Revathi Advaithi, President and Chief Operating Officer–Electrical Sector
Uday Yadav, President and Chief Operating Officer–Industrial Sector
Richard Eubanks, President–Electrical Products Group
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
We design our executive compensation plans and programs to help attract, motivate, reward, and retain highly qualified executives who are capable of creating and sustaining value for our shareholders over the long term. We endorse compensation actions that fairly reflect Company performance as well as the responsibilities and personal performance of individual executives.
HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Our executive compensation programs are intended to align the interests of our executives with those of our stakeholders and are structured to reflect best practices. On average, more than 75% of our named executive officers' compensation is performance-based and tied to our short- and long-term incentive programs. Key features of these programs include:
Caps on payouts under our short- and long-term incentive plans;
Shareholder-approved equity plans;
A clawback policy;
A policy that prohibits hedging or pledging of our shares;
Share ownership and holding requirements;
No tax gross-ups;
No employment contracts; and
Double-trigger equity vesting upon a change in control.

Pay for Performance Culture 
Our executive compensation programs reflect the belief that the amount earned by our executives must, to a significant extent, depend on achieving rigorous Company, business unit and individual performance objectives designed to enhance shareholder value. The illustration below shows the payouts as a percentage of target under our performance-based short- and long-term incentive programs and total return to shareholders over the last five years. In 2015, we changed the length of our performance-based long-term award periods from four to three years. As a result, two long-term performance periods ended on December 31, 2017 and awards for each period were earned at 25% of target. In 2016, we changed the long-term incentive plan performance criteria from Adjusted Earnings per Share growth and Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital (weighted equally) to relative Total Shareholder Return. The first TSR-based award period began on January 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018. More information about our short- and long-term incentive programs can be found on page 31.
The following illustration shows the correlation between pay and the performance we are delivering to our shareholders.
Total Shareholder Return and Performance-Based Incentive Plan Payouts 
Summary of 2018 Performance-Based Incentive Plan Payouts 
Short-Term Incentives
The corporate performance factor under our short-term incentive plan was 115%. In February 2018 the Committee established Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (which excludes acquisition integration charges) and Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital (CFR) goals. For 2018, the target EPS and CFR objectives were $5.10 and 17.0%, respectively. Actual EPS and CFR were $5.39 (after excluding the impact of an arbitration decision) and 18.1%, which generated a calculated payout above 140% of target. However, management recommended and the Committee determined it was appropriate to reduce the payout to 115% of target.   
2018 EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN GOALS AND RESULTS
Back to Contents 
Long-Term Incentives
2016-2018 ESIP: Our 2016-2018 long-term, performance-based Executive Strategic Incentive Plan ("ESIP") was earned at 115.79% of target.  In 2016, we changed the performance criteria under our long-term incentive plan from Adjusted Earnings per Share growth and average Cash Flow Return on Gross Capital to the rank of our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a group of peers. The first TSR-based award period concluded on December 31, 2018 and the results are summarized below.

2016-2018 ESIP opportunities took the form of performance share units and were settled in Eaton ordinary shares.  Dividend equivalents were paid in cash based on the earned number of share units and the aggregate dividend paid to our shareholders over the award period. Additional information about the 2016-2018 ESIP awards can be found on page 33.
Performance Restricted Share Units Granted in 2016:  Executives earned 100% of a one-time, performance-based long-term incentive opportunity that was granted in 2016.  In February 2016, the Committee granted a performance-based long-term incentive opportunity to the executives who were named executive officers at the end of 2015. At the time, the Committee recognized that the efforts of the then new leadership team would be particularly critical to pursuing profitability and maintaining a competitive advantage during periods of softening in our end markets in addition to managing a significant leadership transition. To foster continued engagement, motivation, and retention during this period, the Committee granted performance share units which could be earned after three years if at least 80% of the publicly announced $418 million cumulative restructuring savings goal was achieved. Actual cumulative savings was $518 million and executives earned 100% of their awards.

Earned shares vested on the date the Committee determined performance results, which for this grant was February 26, 2019. Dividend equivalents were paid in cash based on the earned number of share units and the aggregate dividend paid to our shareholders over the award period. Please see Performance Restricted Share Units Granted in 2016 on page 34 for more information about this grant. 
Review of 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The Board of Directors is committed to understanding the views of our shareholders by providing an opportunity to endorse our executive compensation through an advisory, non-binding vote. In 2018, our shareholders approved our executives' compensation by a vote of 94%. 
The Committee considered these voting results, shareholder feedback, and a comprehensive assessment of Eaton's executive compensation programs, and in light of the support we received from shareholders in 2018, did not make substantive changes to our executive compensation plans or programs. The Committee will continue to review our compensation programs each year in light of the annual "say-on-pay" voting results and shareholder feedback.

2018 CEO REALIZED PAY AND OUR PERFORMANCE
Our compensation programs for Mr. Arnold and the other named executive officers are heavily weighted toward performance-based opportunities that are at-risk and subject to our performance. 
The table below illustrates the relationship between Mr. Arnold's target award opportunity and the amounts he actually earned based on our performance against the metrics established for the short- and long-term incentive plans that ended on December 31, 2018. Short- and long-term incentive plan metrics are intended to drive results that create value for our shareholders. This table supplements, but does not substitute, the information contained in the Summary Compensation Table on page 42. Each pay component shown below is discussed in more detail in the CD&A that follows.
COMPENSATION REALIZED BY OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN 2018

The long-term incentive opportunities listed below were earned during a performance period that ended on December 31, 2018 but did not vest until February 26, 2019. The amount realized upon the vesting of these awards on February 26, 2019 will be reported in our next proxy statement. Therefore, these amounts are not included in the table above.  
2016-2018 ESIP   2016-2018     Executives earned 115.79% of the target number of performance share units that were granted in 2016. Dividend equivalents were paid in cash based on the earned number of share units and the aggregate dividend paid to shareholders over the award period.   $2,500,000 expressed as 49,280 PSUs     57,062 earned PSUs  
2016 Performance RSU Grant  2016-2018     Executives earned 100% of the target number of performance RSUs that were granted in 2016 and tied to the achievement of certain restructuring goals described on page 34.   25,650      PSUs     25,650 earned PSUs   
[END TABLE]
The realized pay table differs from the Summary Compensation Table in a number of ways, including:
In addition to pay actually received, the Summary Compensation Table includes the accounting value of equity compensation granted during the year, which may or may not ever be earned. In contrast, this realized pay table reports only the elements of compensation actually received and/or realized by Mr. Arnold for performance periods that ended on December 31, 2018. Specifically, the values for equity awards in the realized pay table show the gross compensation (before applicable taxes) that Mr. Arnold received in 2018 upon the vesting of RSUs and PSUs (as shown in the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018" table on page 46), regardless of when the shares were granted.
In addition, the realized pay table does not reflect compensation that is based upon pension value increases although these amounts are included in the Summary Compensation Table. The Committee reviews compensation that is based upon the change in pension values as part of the Tally Sheet review discussed on page 29 in the context of a competitive overall benefit design and not as an element of its annual compensation decisions.

ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION AND ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE
Membership and Responsibilities 
The Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors in 2018 consisted of five independent non-employee directors and is supported by our human resources department. As discussed below, the Committee also may retain one or more independent compensation consultants to assist it.
The Committee is responsible for handling a variety of organizational and compensation matters pertaining to Eaton's leadership, including those shown in the table below. The Committee's charter is available on our website at http://www.eaton.com/governance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation-related Tasks  Organizational Tasks  
[END TABLE]
Reviews, approves, and oversees all of our executive compensation plans, including our stock plans;
Establishes performance objectives under our short- and long-term incentive compensation plans;
Determines the attainment of those performance objectives and the awards to be made to our senior officers under our short- and long-term incentive compensation plans;
Determines the compensation for our senior officers, including salary and short- and long-term incentive opportunities;
Reviews compensation practices relating to key employees to confirm that these practices remain equitable and competitive; and
Reviews new benefit plans or significant changes in such plans or changes with a disproportionate effect on our officers or primarily benefiting key employees.
Evaluates the performance of the CEO, with input from all non-employee directors;
Reviews the performance capabilities of the other senior officers based on input from the CEO;
Reviews succession planning for officer positions including the position of the CEO;
Reviews proposed organization or responsibility changes at the senior officer level; and
Reviews our practices for the recruitment and development of a diverse talent pool.
Use of Consultants
The Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners as its independent executive compensation consultant to support the Committee's oversight and management of our executive compensation programs. The consultant's duties include helping the Committee validate our executive compensation plans and programs through periodic comprehensive studies. The consultant performed a variety of work for the Committee, including assessing Eaton's executive compensation programs relative to market trends and best-in-class governance practices, providing independent feedback on our analytical work, and assisting the Committee in its review and discussion of material agenda items and its decision-making about our executive compensation programs and individual compensation opportunities. The consultant also coordinated and supported the annual performance appraisal for Mr. Arnold. The Committee used this appraisal as one of several factors in determining his payout under our short-term incentive plan for 2018 and also considered it in determining whether to adjust his base salary or his short- and long-term incentive targets for the next year.
The Committee's written policies require the Company to obtain its review and approval before awarding any material consulting assignment to a firm that the Committee already has engaged. This policy ensures that the Committee's consultants are well positioned to provide independent and impartial advice on executive compensation and governance matters.

HOW WE ESTABLISH AND VALIDATE PAY
This section explains the Committee's process for establishing and validating our pay targets. As shown in the table and described in detail below, this process involves several important analyses:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Analysis  Data Source  Purpose  How It's Used  When It's Conducted  
Market Analysis  Aon Hewitt Associates and Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation databases  Setting pay for our executives  Setting base pay and short- and long-term incentive targets for the next year/award cycle  November — February  
Performance Assessments  Executive feedback  Evaluating individual performance based on input from the CEO  Determining the short-term incentive award payments for the award period that recently ended and in determining merit increases and adjusting individual award opportunities for the next award cycle  November — January  
Tally Sheets  Internal compensation and benefits data  Evaluating total remuneration and internal pay equity of our executives  Evaluating the total remuneration and projected payments to the named executive officers under various termination scenarios. This helps to determine if each executive's compensation package is appropriately aligned with that of internal peers and whether any adjustment to our compensation plans or programs, or an individual's pay package, is necessary.  February  
Peer Pay and Performance  Analysis  Publicly available financial  and compensation information as reported by  the companies that we have identified as peers for compensation and strategic planning purposes  Evaluating pay and performance to validate individual compensation  plans that were established in February  Comparing pay and performance results with that of the peer group to determine the efficacy of the "Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process". This study also provides insight into how competitors establish their pay for performance profile.  July

[END TABLE]
In preparing our comparison for 2018, we used the survey results for "industrial" companies (as categorized by the survey vendors), whether publicly or privately held, with revenues between $10 billion and $50 billion. The group contains between 100 and 120 companies in which the revenue range is approximately one-half to two times our revenue. We believe this comparator group adequately represents the market in which we compete for talent. The companies participating in each survey vary, and we are not able to determine which of the companies reported data for each position and each component of pay.
Back to Contents
Analysis of Internal Pay Equity and our Current Pay Levels — Internal equity among similarly situated positions is an important consideration in establishing individual pay targets. We maintain internal equity by establishing approximately the same target incentive opportunities for similarly situated positions. When determining what positions are similarly situated, we consider the following aspects of each position: its essential functions, the ability of the position holder to influence our overall results, any educational requirements, where the position stands in our leadership ranks, and job demands such as frequent travel and the responsibility to respond to business matters at any time and under any circumstances.
Tally Sheets — In addition to the market analysis, each February we provide the Committee with a comprehensive compensation Tally Sheet for each named executive officer. These Tally Sheets, which also are reviewed by the Committee's independent consultant, help the Committee evaluate total remuneration and internal pay equity. The Committee reviews them before making decisions about the compensation of the named executive officers for the next year. Each Tally Sheet includes all components of the executive's current compensation, including base salary, short-term incentive compensation, long-term cash incentive compensation, equity incentive compensation, retirement savings programs, health and welfare programs, and the cost of personal executive benefits. The Committee also reviews potential payments under various termination scenarios.
Performance Assessments — Assessments of executive performance are another key part of the Committee's Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process. Mr. Arnold meets individually with his direct reports, including the named executive officers, to discuss the performance assessments for their respective direct reports and to formulate initial recommendations for an appropriate total compensation plan for each executive. No member of management, including Mr. Arnold, makes recommendations regarding his or her own pay. The Committee meets with its independent consultant in Executive Session (with no members of management in attendance) to review Mr. Arnold's performance assessment, the comprehensive market data for his position, and his Tally Sheet to establish his total compensation plan.
Evaluating Pay
In July of each year, the Committee evaluates pay relative to external market data to validate the individual compensation opportunities that were established in February, and also considers whether we are setting appropriate performance criteria. This process involves collecting and reviewing peer group information and third-party survey data and analyzing it as described below.
PEER GROUP ANALYSIS
Peer Group Selection — Historically, we did not use a compensation peer group to set compensation targets for our named executive officers. Instead, we used the survey data reported by two consulting firms as described under "Market Analysis" on page 28 as the primary source for setting pay and evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation programs. In July 2017, the Committee adopted a compensation peer group and starting in 2018, used the proxy compensation data reported by this group together with the survey data reported by the two consulting firms to set each named executive officer's base salary, short-, and long-term incentive targets. The Committee adopted the peer group in order to have additional data points to consider when setting pay and evaluating compensation programs. The Committee chose the companies in the compensation peer group based on revenue size, market capitalization, and industry. The compensation peer group also represents a sample of companies with whom we compete for talent. Eaton's revenue and market cap are approximately aligned with the median revenue and market cap of the compensation peer group. 
The compensation peer group does not replace Eaton's strategic peer group that is used by the Board in setting the Company's strategic plan. The publicly traded companies in the strategic peer group continue to serve as the relative peer group for purposes of comparing total shareholder return as it relates to Eaton's long-term performance based incentive plan. The strategic peers were chosen based on their industry segment, among other considerations, so that the overall revenue of each segment would approximate Eaton's revenues for each segment (Aerospace, Electrical, Hydraulics, Vehicle) versus overall revenue for the entire enterprise. The revenue of many companies in the strategic peer group is smaller than Eaton's and given that there is a correlation between the revenue size of a company and the pay it delivers, the Committee determined that the strategic peer group would not serve as an appropriate peer group for purposes of setting pay. Therefore, with input from its consultant, the Committee chose the companies listed in the following table as the compensation peer group.

[END TABLE]
Peer Pay Analysis — Each year we provide the Committee with an analysis that includes the compensation reported by each publicly traded peer in its annual proxy statement and market survey data for positions that are equivalent to positions held by our named executive officers. The Committee uses this analysis in reviewing and establishing our stretch incentive plan goals and in answering whether our compensation targets are appropriate relative to market comparators. In 2018, this review of survey and peer proxy data confirmed that Eaton's compensation opportunities were aligned with the external data points. 
COMPONENTS OF COMPENSATION
In this section, we describe the main components of our compensation, including the metrics we use for our performance-based incentives.

[END TABLE]
We pay a competitive base salary to our executive officers in recognition of their job responsibilities. In general, the Committee sets base salaries at approximately the market median as described under "Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process" on page 28. On occasion, the Committee may set an executive's base salary above the reported market median to foster retention and/or recognize superior performance. Executives must demonstrate consistently effective individual performance in order to be eligible for a base salary increase. In making salary adjustments, the Committee considers the executive's base salary and total compensation relative to the market median and other factors 
Back to Contents such as individual performance against business plans, initiative, leadership, experience, knowledge, and success in building organizational capability.
2018 BASE SALARY 
During the 2018 Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process, the Committee reviewed each executive's base salary relative to the market data as described under "Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process," as well as the executive's individual performance over the prior year. After discussing these items, the Committee determined it was appropriate to deliver base salary increases on July 1, 2018, to the named executive officers as shown in the following table.  Mr. Arnold became CEO in 2016 and since that time, the Committee has provided salary increases that are intended to align his base pay with a market competitive level.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive  Increase%  New Base Salary  
C. Arnold  9.00%   $1,250,000   
R. Fearon  4.00%   $965,328   
R. Advaithi  4.00%   $787,405   
U. Yadav  5.00%   $687,960   
R. Eubanks  4.00%  $569,015  
[END TABLE]
Short-Term Performance-Based Compensation
We establish a competitive annual cash incentive opportunity for each named executive officer which is intended to align with the market median short-term incentive target (expressed as a percentage of base salary) as determined in our annual market analysis. The Committee determines target opportunities for each executive in February during its Total Compensation Analysis and Planning Process. 
Metrics, Goals and Results — In February 2018, the Committee established EPS and CFR goals based on its review of market analyses, our annual profit plan as approved by the Board of Directors, external research reports, and analyses of peer group data. The Committee also considered EPS growth rate guidance for us and our strategic peers as a key starting point for setting aggressive performance objectives for our short-term incentive plan. The short-term objectives historically have been tied to EPS and CFR metrics. The EPS metric measures earnings growth, while the CFR objective is an internal measure of return on capital. We and the Committee believe these are appropriate metrics because of their link to shareholder value creation. The Committee believes that the target level EPS and CRF goals established at the beginning of 2018 were demanding but attainable.
The following table shows the 2018 goals and our actual results for the year after adjusting for the impact of an arbitration decision (which is a liability that we assumed in the transaction to acquire Cooper Industries, plc).  EPS and CFR results were $5.39 and 18.1%, respectively.  The results generated a calculated payout above 140% of target but management recommended and the Committee determined it was appropriate to reduce the calculated payout to 115% of target. 
2018 EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN GOALS AND RESULTS 
2018 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS 
In February 2018, in addition to establishing EIC Plan performance objectives, the Committee also established an individual target award opportunity for each executive that reflected the market median target annual incentive opportunity as determined in our annual market analysis as described on page 28.  At the end of the award period, the Committee considered the following items in determining individual payouts:
Back to Contents
The Company's actual performance relative to EPS and CFR performance objectives and the Committee's decision to reduce the payout to 115% of target as described above.
Business unit and individual performance factors that are based on the achievement of the performance criteria described below:
Financial Goals: Achieving the Company's annual financial plan, as well as the annual financial plan for the executive's business unit.
Growth Goals: Building our brand; outgrowing the markets in which we operate; introducing new products and services.
Operational Excellence: Workplace safety and emissions reduction; advancements in quality; supply chain improvement; and operational efficiency/productivity.
Building Organizational Capacity: Reinforcing our ethical standards; attracting and developing talent; developing a diverse and inclusive organization; promoting a learning culture.
The following table illustrates each named executive officer's 2018 award opportunity and his or her actual EIC award relative to that opportunity.  Participants in our EIC Plan must be employed on the last day of the award period, which was December 31, 2018, to be eligible for an award.  Business unit and individual performance factors shown below are rounded to the nearest whole percentage.  Each named executive officer's short-term incentive award is reported in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table.

[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
The Committee establishes a target long-term incentive opportunity for each executive that is intended to align with the market median values as determined in our annual market analysis. We provide long-term incentive compensation to our executive officers in two components that generally are weighted as follows:
50% in Performance Share Units: Relative TSR serves as the performance criteria for the performance-based ESIP periods which are three years in length. ESIP opportunities are denominated in performance share units and the number of share units earned by executives will depend on the rank of our total return to shareholders against that of a TSR Peer Group. The value realized by executives will depend on share price appreciation or depreciation over the award period; thereby providing a direct link to shareholder value creation.
50% in Time Based Equity Awards: The named executive officers receive approximately an equal mix of stock options and RSUs which also provide a link to external performance. Time-based equity vests over a minimum of a three-year period and exeuctives must be employed on the vesting date in order for shares to vest.
We believe that this "portfolio approach" to structuring long-term incentives provides an appropriate balance that focuses executives on both an external and internal measure of our success. In limited circumstances, the Committee provides retention restricted share unit grants to foster engagement and retention. The Committee's independent compensation consultant has confirmed that this approach is appropriate to delivering long-term compensation and is consistent with market practices.  No named executive officers received retention grants in 2018.

Equity Grant Practices — We typically grant equity-based awards in February.  The Committee has the authority to fix the date and all terms and conditions of equity grants to executive officers and other employees under our various stock plans, all of which have been approved by our shareholders. Our equity program adheres to the following best practices:
Equity-based awards generally vest over, or upon the conclusion of, at least a three-year period and is contingent upon continued service with us over the vesting period (except in the case of a divestment of a business or upon an employee's death, disability, or retirement).
The aggregate number of shares or share units underlying options or related to other awards that may be granted to any employee during any three consecutive calendar year period may not exceed 2,400,000 under our 2015 Stock Plan.
No more than 5% of the total number of shares authorized for delivery under the Plan may vest within less than one year after the grant date (except for awards granted to non-employee directors, in the event of a change of control of the Company, in the event of a divestment of a business or upon an employee's death, disability, or retirement).
We set the strike price for all of our stock options at the fair market value of our shares on the date of the grant. Our current shareholder-approved stock plans define "fair market value" as the "closing price" as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of the grant.

PERFORMANCE BASED LONG-TERM INCENTIVES FOR THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018
2016-2018 ESIP Performance Criteria: The Committee adopted relative TSR as the performance criteria for the 2016-2018 ESIP period. Prior to 2016, awards were determined based on company Adjusted EPS growth and CFR goals. In setting the Adjusted EPS growth and CFR goals for the prior periods, the Board would evaluate our Strategic Plan projections and analysts' estimates of peer company performance; however, the impact of changes in end market growth rates had a disproportionate impact on actual versus forecasted results. Therefore, the Committee chose TSR as the metric to alleviate the increasingly difficult market calibration issues and to introduce a stronger sense of relative peer performance. The change also eliminated any concern about the use of overlapping criteria in our annual EIC Plan and our long-term ESIP program. We and the Committee believe a short-term plan with an earnings growth and return on assets orientation (via the EPS and CFR goals) complemented by a TSR-driven long-term plan is an effective combination that will enhance shareholder value.
The 2016-2018 ESIP was designed such that our TSR rank among a TSR Peer Group would determine an adjustment factor which could range from 0% to 200%. Ranking in between the threshold, target and maximum performance levels results in linear interpolation of the percentage earned. 
Additionally, if our TSR was positive but ranked the lowest among the peer group, the maximum payout that could be earned was 25% of target. If our TSR was the highest when compared to that of the peer companies, but was negative, then the maximum payout that could be earned was 100% of target. Consistent with our historical practice, awards under this plan design were capped at 200% of target.
The TSR Peer Group for the 2016-2018 award period included nineteen companies, thirteen of whom were direct peers in either the Electrical, Hydraulics, Aerospace or Vehicle segments. The number of directly competitive peers in each segment roughly equated to the percentage of that segment's revenue as a percent of total Eaton revenues at the beginning of the award period. The remaining six peers are indirect but relevant peers. 
2016-2018 ESIP Awards — Awards for the 2016-2018 award period were determined based on our TSR ranking among the TSR Peer Group.  For ESIP TSR calculation purposes, our stock price at the beginning of the award period was $46.94 and our stock price at the end of the award period was $68.66, adjusted to reflect dividend reinvestments over the period. This resulted in TSR of 46.26%, an absolute ranking among the peers at nine out of twenty, and a percentile ranking at the 57.89th percentile. This percentile ranking resulted in a performance adjustment factor of 115.79% of  target.  The results are shown in the following tables.

Back to Contents of our former CEO later that year. The Committee recognized that the efforts of the new leadership team would be particularly critical to pursuing profitability and our competitive advantage during periods of decline while managing a significant leadership transition. Therefore, the Committee granted performance share units that would vest after three years subject to the attainment of certain restructuring plan savings objectives. Specifically, the company must have achieved at least 80% of the publicly announced three-year restructuring plan savings of $418 million prior to the end of the period in order to earn any award. If less than 80% of the goal was achieved, no shares would be earned and the performance share units would be forfeited. If at least 80% but less than 100% of the goal was achieved, executives would earn 80% of the performance share units granted. If 100% or more of the goal was achieved, executives may earn 100% of the performance share units.  Actual cumulative savings was $518 million and executives who were employed with Eaton on February 26, 2019 earned 100% of their awards.

The payout between threshold and maximum will be interpolated based on the rank of our TSR among the peer companies.
The TSR Peer Group for the 2018-2020 award period includes twenty companies, fourteen of whom are direct peers in either the Electrical, Hydraulics, Aerospace or Vehicle segments. The number of directly competitive peers in each segment roughly equates to the percentage of that segment's revenue as a percent of total Eaton revenues. The remaining six peers are indirect but relevant peers. The companies included in the TSR Peer Group are:
Direct Peers: ABB, Ltd., Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc., American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc., BorgWarner, Inc., Cummins Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Hubbell Inc., Legrand S.A., Moog Inc., Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Rockwell Automation, Inc., Schneider Electric SE, Siemens AG, and Woodward, Inc. 
Indirect Peers: Deere & Company, Dover Corporation, Honeywell International Inc., Illinois Tool Works Inc., Ingersoll-Rand plc, and United Technologies Corporation.
Performance Share Units Granted for the 2018-2020 ESIP — In February 2018, the Committee established total long-term incentive opportunities, expressed as a cash value, for each executive. Targets are intended to align with the market median long-term incentive value as determined during our annual market analysis described on page 28. Half of the long-term incentive target was converted to a number of performance share units based on the 30-day average closing price of our ordinary shares at the beginning of the award period. At the end of the award period, the number of performance share units will be adjusted up or down based on achievement of our TSR rank relative to that of the peers as previously described. The adjusted number of share units, if any, will be distributed to participants in the form of our ordinary shares. An accumulated dividend equivalent covering the performance period will be paid in cash based on the number of share units actually earned.
RSUs Granted in 2018 — In February 2018, the Committee approved RSU grants that represented approximately 25% of each named executive officer's target long-term incentive opportunity. These RSUs vest in approximately equal installments over three years, subject to continued employment with us. We pay dividend equivalents on the earned number of RSUs at the time the shares vest. 
Stock Options Granted in 2018 — Stock options make up the remaining 25% of each named executive officer's total target long-term incentive opportunity. The stock options granted in 2018 will vest in substantially equal installments over three years, subject to the executive's continued employment with us, and have a strike price equal to the closing price of our ordinary shares on the date of the grant.
2018 Long-Term Incentive Grants — Each named executive officer's target long-term incentive opportunity and mix of grant types is shown below.

Health and Welfare Benefits and Retirement Income Plans 
We provide our executive officers with the same health and welfare and retirement income benefit programs that we provide to our other salaried employees in the United States, with certain exceptions described below. Our named executive officers may choose to participate in our 401(k) plan and receive Company matching contributions, which are reported as "Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table. We provide 401(k) matching contributions that comply with Internal Revenue Code limits.
Back to Contents
In place of typical Company-paid group term life insurance, we provide all executive officers and approximately 600 other employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2016 with Company-paid life insurance coverage under two separate policies. The aggregate value of the two policies is approximately equal to an executive's annual base salary, and this level of coverage is consistent with the level of coverage provided to other non-union U.S. salaried employees through our group term life policy. The majority of the executives' life insurance (base salary minus $50,000) is covered under an executive-owned individual whole-life policy, with the remaining $50,000 of insurance covered under our group term life policy. The value of the Company-paid premium for the whole life policy is imputed as income to each covered executive. We decided to provide this executive life insurance arrangement to allow each executive to have a paid-up policy at retirement that would mirror Company-provided post-retirement group term life insurance, but with less post-retirement tax complexity for both the executive and the Company. Employees who were hired on or after January 1, 2016 are provided coverage approximately equal to one time base salary under our group term life policy.
Other Retirement and Compensation Arrangements 
The 2018 Pension Benefits table on page 47 reports retirement benefits for Mr. Arnold and the other named executive officers. Certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual benefits that may be paid from a tax-qualified retirement plan. As permitted under the Code, the Board of Directors has authorized plans under which payment will be made for any benefits that may exceed those limits. If these nonqualified benefits accrued before 2005, executives may choose a lump sum payment or an annuity (unless otherwise determined by the Committee), except that if there is a change of control of the Company, they will be paid at the time of the event (unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors) in a lump sum. These benefits that accrued after January 1, 2005 will be paid in the form of a single sum at retirement.
In response to market practices and to enhance our ability to attract and retain key executives, the Board of Directors also adopted plans that provide supplemental annual retirement income to certain executives whom we hire mid-career, because they do not have the opportunity to accumulate significant credited service with us under our tax-qualified retirement income or nonqualified restoration plans. These supplemental plans deliver a benefit if the executive either retires at 55 or older with at least 10 years of service, or at 65 or older regardless of the years of service. No new participants have been added to this plan since 2011.
The tax-qualified pension plans that we maintain for our U.S. salaried and non-union employees define the term compensation to include base salary, overtime pay, pay premiums and awards under any short-term variable pay or incentive compensation plans (including amounts deferred for receipt at a later date). We use this same definition for calculating pension benefits under the nonqualified executive retirement income arrangements described in the preceding paragraph. These qualified and nonqualified retirement income plans are the only compensation or benefit plans or programs that we provide to executive officers that consider base salary and earned annual incentive awards in the calculation of the executives' account balances. Long-term incentives, including cash and amounts realized upon the exercise of stock options and/or vesting other equity-based awards are not factored into these calculations.
Deferral Plans 
We provide our executives with opportunities to defer the receipt of their earned and otherwise payable awards under our short- and long-term cash incentive plans. Our deferral plans do not allow executives to defer the receipt of their share-based awards. We offer these deferral arrangements so that our executives have a competitive opportunity to accumulate additional retirement assets and a means to meet our share ownership guidelines.
Personal Benefits 
We provide our executive officers with limited personal benefits such as reimbursement for financial and estate planning and tax preparation. Personal benefits are treated as taxable income to the executive.
Employment Contracts and Change of Control Agreements 
We do not provide our executive officers with employment contracts; however, we do enter into Change of Control Agreements with each executive officer. The agreements do not contain tax gross-up provisions, but do contain double-trigger severance provisions and restrictive covenants. These agreements provide benefits if an executive's employment is terminated or materially changed for certain reasons following a change of control. We believe that these agreements are in the best interest of our shareholders because they help ensure that we will have the continued dedication and focus of key executives in the event of a change of control of the Company. Details of our Change of 
Back to Contents
Control Agreements may be found in the narrative discussion accompanying the Potential Payments Upon Termination beginning on page 49.
Limited Tax Protection for Relocation and Foreign Assignments 
We and the Committee believe that tax protection is appropriate in very limited circumstances to avoid the potential for the value of a benefit to be reduced as a result of tax requirements that are beyond an executive's control. Specifically, we provide tax protection for our employees under our relocation and foreign assignment policies so that they are able to make decisions to accept new assignments without concern that relocating would be a disadvantage from a tax standpoint.
Use of Our Aircraft 
We own, operate, and maintain Company aircraft to enhance the ability of our executive officers and other corporate and business leaders to conduct business in an effective manner. This principle guides how the aircraft are used. Our stringent aircraft use policy ensures that the primary use of this mode of transportation is to satisfy business needs and that all aircraft use is accounted for at all times and in accordance with applicable laws. The Board of Directors has directed Mr. Arnold to use our aircraft for his business and personal travel, whenever feasible, to ensure his personal security and enhance his productivity. Our aircraft policy does not permit other executives to use Company-owned aircraft for personal use without the advance approval of the Chief Executive Officer. No named executive officers receive tax protection on the imputed income for personal use of Company-owned aircraft.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION POLICIES AND GUIDELINES
Share Ownership Guidelines 
We expect all of our executive officers and certain other high-level key executives to hold a number of our shares with a value equal to a pre-determined multiple of their base salary. These multiples, as shown below, represent the minimum guidelines and are consistent with trends we have seen in the competitive market. Each executive must own a minimum of 20% of the required shares outright. Executives are expected to hold shares that vest and shares acquired upon the exercise of stock options until these requirements are met. In addition, executives are expected to reach these guidelines within five years of appointment to a new position and are expected to satisfy them for the duration of their employment with the Company.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position  Minimum Guideline  
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   6 times base salary  
Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer   4 times base salary  
President and Chief Operating Officer Electrical or Industrial Sector   4 times base salary  
Other Officers  2-3 times base salary  
General Managers and other ESIP participants  1 times base salary  
[END TABLE]
The Committee reviews each executive officer's share ownership relative to these levels each February.  As of the date this proxy was filed, each of the named executive officers exceeded his ownership and holding requirements.
Anti-Hedging and Pledging 
We have a policy that prohibits directors and officers, including the named executive officers, from engaging in financial hedging of their investment risk in our shares and from pledging our shares as collateral for a loan.
Clawback Policy 
The Board of Directors has adopted a formal policy stating that, if an executive engaged in any fraud, misconduct or other bad-faith action that, directly or indirectly, caused or partially caused the need for a material accounting restatement for any periods as to which a performance-based award was paid or credited to the executive during the 12-month period following the first public issuance of the incorrect financial statement, such award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation or reimbursement to the Company at the Board's discretion. The clawback policy covers any executive who participates in our ESIP or any successor plans. Our incentive compensation plans, stock plans and deferral plans all include the provisions of this policy. This policy may be found on our website at http://www.eaton.com/governance.

Tax and Accounting Considerations 
We carefully monitor and comply with any changes in the laws, regulations, accounting standards and related interpretive guidance that impact our executive compensation plans and programs. Tax and accounting considerations have never played a central role in the process of determining the compensation or benefit plans and programs that are provided to our executives. Instead, the Committee consistently has structured our executive compensation program in a manner intended to ensure that it is competitive in the marketplace for executive talent and provides incentives and rewards that focus our executives on reaching desired internal and external performance levels. Once the appropriate programs and plans are identified, we administer and account for them in accordance with applicable requirements.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 repealed the performance-based exception to section 162(m) and limits deductible compensation paid to covered employees to $1 million. 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPENSATION PLANS AND RISK
Each year, the Committee and management conduct a comprehensive review of our executive and broad-based compensation programs to determine whether any of our compensation programs, either individually or in the aggregate, would encourage employees to undertake excessive risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company.
Compensation and Organization Committee Annual Risk Assessment 
After reviewing an inventory of our 2018 broad-based variable pay and sales commission plans, which included the number of participants in each plan, the participants' levels within the organization, the target and maximum payment potential, performance criteria under each plan, and the type of plan (for example, management-by-objective and goal sharing), the Committee concluded that none of the broad-based programs would likely give rise to a material risk.
The Committee also applied a risk assessment to the short- and long-term incentive plans that are described in this CD&A. This analysis included, but was not limited to, (a) whether performance goals were balanced and potential payments were reasonable based on potential achievement of those goals at the threshold, target and maximum levels; (b) whether there is a balance between short- and long-term incentive opportunities and that pay is not overly weighted toward annual incentive opportunities; and, (c) how our performance objectives and target award opportunities compared to the objectives and target awards underlying our peers' incentive programs.
Our Executive Compensation Strategies and Programs Are Structured to Reduce Risk
The Committee and management also concluded that our executive compensation strategy and programs are structured in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders and do not create a material risk due to a variety of mitigating factors, such as:
An emphasis on long-term compensation that utilizes a balanced portfolio of compensation elements and delivers rewards based on sustained performance over time;
The Committee's sole power to set performance objectives for our incentive plans. In our short-term plan, this includes CFR and adjusted EPS objectives and qualitative goals such as leadership development, growth, operational excellence, and building organizational capacity. We believe these items contribute to increased shareholder value;
Our long-term performance plan (ESIP) focuses on relative TSR. This creates a focus on driving sustained performance over multiple award periods that mitigates the potential for executives to take excessive risks to drive one-time, short-term performance spikes in any one period;
The use of equity awards to foster retention and align our executives' interests with those of our shareholders;
Capping the potential payouts under the short- and long-term incentive plans to eliminate the potential for windfalls;
A clawback policy that allows us to recover compensation in the case of a material restatement of financial results and/or employee misconduct;
Share ownership guidelines; and
A broad array of benefit programs that offer employees and executives an opportunity to build meaningful retirement assets throughout their careers.

  Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation  Reports the amount earned for 2018 under the EIC Plan. The incentive payments reported in this column were approved by the Committee at its February 26, 2019 meeting and, to the extent not deferred by the executive, will be paid on March 29, 2019.      
Changes in Pension Value  and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings   "Changes in Pension Value" represents the total change in the actuarial present value of each named executive officer's accumulated benefit under all of our defined benefit pension plans (both tax qualified and nonqualified) from the measurement date used for financial reporting purposes. The change in this column from year-to-year reflects items such as: changes in compensation as defined under the pension plan in which the executive participates, an additional year of service, and changes in the discount and interest rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit reported in each respective year. 
●  "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" include earnings on deferred compensation that exceed 120% of a specified rate of interest for long-term debt instruments established by the Internal Revenue Service, when applicable. Under the disclosure rules, earnings on deferred compensation are considered to be "above-market" if the rate or formula used to calculate the interest under the plan in which the executive participates exceeded a rate of interest established by the Internal Revenue Service. No named executive officers had "above-market" earnings on deferred compensation.

"All Other Compensation" includes the aggregate incremental cost we incurred for certain personal benefits, including:
Reimbursement of financial, tax and estate planning fees.
Personal Use of Company Aircraft: Is the executive's use of our airplanes for personal travel. In 2018 each of the named executive officers had family members accompany him or her on our aircraft to certain business-related events and meetings. There is no incremental cost to the company for family members to accompany executives on business trips; however, we are disclosing this perquisite in accordance with SEC rules.  We do not reimburse named executive officers for tax costs related to personal or family member use of our aircraft.
Life Insurance: We provide approximately 600 employees, including the named executive officers, with the opportunity to acquire individual whole-life insurance as described on page 37. The annual premium paid by us during 2018 for each of the named executive officers is shown in the chart below. Each participant is responsible for paying individual income taxes due with respect to our insurance program.
401(k) Company Matching Contributions: The amount of our contributions to the named executive officers' accounts under the 401(k) Eaton Savings Plan (the "ESP") is reported below. The ESP permits an employee to contribute a portion of his or her salary to the ESP, subject to limits imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.  
Mr. Eubanks receives an additional employer contribution under the ESP in lieu of a benefit under our defined benefit pension plans.  The amount of the employer contribution is included in the table below.
Mr. Eubanks also received a patent award in the amount of $200. Under the Eaton Patent and Trade Secret Award Program, each inventor involved in the conception of a patentable invention is eligible for an award for the filing of initial patent applications and the issuance of initial patents from an examination patent office.
The amounts of these items reported as "All Other Compensation" are:

2018 PENSION BENEFITS
We maintain three basic types of retirement income plans for our U.S. salaried employees.  The table that follows shows the estimated present value of the benefits payable under each of our retirement income plans.
a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as the Pension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees in the Pension Benefits table) that has two separate benefit formulas: a final average pay formula and a cash balance formula;
two defined benefit restoration plans (collectively referred to as the DB Restoration Plan in the Pension Benefits table); and a plan that allows us to supplement the pension benefits earned under our qualified pension plan and nonqualified DB Restoration Plan to certain elected officers and executives who are recruited by us mid-career (referred to as the Limited Service Supplemental Plan in the Pension Benefits table).
Tax-Qualified Retirement Income Plans — Effective January 1, 2003, employees who were then earning benefits under the "Average Final Annual Compensation" benefit formula (the "AFAC benefit formula") under the Pension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees (the "Pension Plan") were given the option to either: (a) continue earning benefits under the AFAC benefit formula, or (b) convert the value of their accrued benefit to an "opening balance" and commence earning benefits in an "Eaton Personal Pension Account" under the cash balance formula (the "EPPA benefit formula"). Salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2002, but before April 1, 2013, automatically earn benefits under the EPPA benefit formula upon becoming eligible for participation in the Pension Plan.  Any employee hired on or after April 1, 2013 and all U.S. employees of Cooper immediately prior to our acquisition of Cooper will receive an additional employer contribution under the Eaton Savings Plan in lieu of earning a benefit under the Pension Plan.  Employees of Cooper who were eligible for a benefit from the Cooper Pension Plan, which was merged with the Pension Plan on December 31, 2018, will receive no further benefit under the Pension Plan but will receive the additional Eaton Savings Plan contribution.
Under the AFAC benefit formula, annual normal retirement benefits are computed at the rate of 1% of average final annual compensation up to the applicable Social Security integration level plus 1.5% of average final annual compensation in excess of the Social Security integration level, multiplied by the employee's years of credited service. In addition, the employee receives a supplement equal to 1/2% of average final annual compensation up to the applicable Social Security integration level payable until the Social Security Normal Retirement Age. An employee's average final annual compensation is the average annual amount of his or her eligible compensation (generally consisting of salary plus short-term executive incentive compensation for service during the five consecutive years within the last 10 years of employment for which the employee's total compensation was the greatest). Years of credited service includes the number of years of employment between age 21 and retirement, subject to a maximum of 44 years. Corporate policies require the named executive officers to retire at age 65.
Back to Contents
Under the EPPA benefit formula, a participant's single sum retirement benefit is accumulated throughout his or her career with us. This single sum amount is represented as a notional account balance to which credits are regularly added. The credits are equal to a percentage of eligible compensation (generally consisting of salary and short-term incentive compensation) plus interest at a specified rate and, where applicable, cost-of-living credits on certain opening balances. The percentage of eligible compensation credited to the participant's notional account balance varies over his or her career based on the sum of the participant's age and service with us. For any period when that sum is less than 50, 5.0% of eligible compensation is credited. For any period when the sum is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), 6.0% of eligible compensation is credited. When the sum is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), 7.0% of eligible compensation is credited. When the sum is 70 or greater, 8.0% of eligible compensation is credited. Except as noted below, upon termination of employment, the notional account balance is available as a single sum or may be converted to one of several annuity forms. Under the standard post-retirement surviving spouse option for the AFAC and EPPA benefit formulas, the participant receives a reduced pension, and a pension equal to 50% of the reduced pension is payable to his or her surviving spouse. For example, the benefit for an employee electing that option at age 65 whose spouse is five years younger would be approximately 11.5% less than the amount of the participant's annual benefit.
Nonqualified Defined Benefit Retirement Plans — Certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual benefits that may be paid from a tax-qualified retirement plan. This includes a limitation on the amount of annual compensation that may be taken into account in calculating a participant's benefit under a qualified retirement plan. As permitted under the Internal Revenue Code, the Board of Directors has authorized the payment from our general funds of any benefits calculated under the provisions of the Pension Plan that may exceed those limits. This applies to all participants, including the named executive officers.
Limited Eaton Service Supplemental Retirement Income Plan — The Board of Directors has adopted a plan that provides supplemental annual retirement income to elected officers and certain executives who do not have the opportunity to accumulate significant credited service with us under our tax-qualified retirement income plans, provided that they either retire at age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service with us or retire at age 65 or older regardless of the years of service. The amount of the annual supplement generally is equal to the amount by which a percentage of the executive's average final annual compensation exceeds his or her earned retirement income. This includes amounts receivable under the retirement plans described above. The percentage of average final annual compensation used for this purpose depends upon an executive's age and years of service at retirement. The percentage ranges from 25% (for retirements at age 55 with less than 15 years of service) to 50% (for retirements at age 62 or older with 15 years or more of service). Benefits accrued and vested before January 1, 2005 under either the nonqualified or the limited service plans generally are paid in one of the forms available under the Pension Plan as elected by the participant. Benefits earned after 2004 are paid as a single lump sum. With respect to all benefits, regardless of when accrued, the present value of the benefit will be paid in a single installment upon a change of control of the Company.

2018 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
We provide our executives with opportunities to defer the receipt of their earned and otherwise payable awards under our short- and long-term cash incentive plans. We offer these plans to provide:
our executives with an opportunity to accumulate additional retirement assets, a means for acquiring our shares in order to meet our share ownership guidelines, and an additional form of employment retention.
The plans described in this section are as follows:
the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (the "DIC Plan");
the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan II (the "DIC Plan II"); and the Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan II (the "IC Deferral Plan II").
DIC Plans — Short-term incentive compensation earned prior to December 31, 2004 was eligible for deferral under the DIC Plan.  On February 10, 2010, the Committee approved the termination of the DIC Plan with respect to all participant accounts except for certain accounts that contain deferrals for the years 1986 through 1989. The accounts that were not terminated earn fixed interest based on market rates and individual mortality assumptions in effect at the time of the deferrals.
 Short-term incentive compensation earned after December 31, 2004 is eligible to be deferred under the DIC Plan II. Incentive compensation earned in 2005 through December 31, 2007 that was deferred under the DIC Plan II was credited with earnings that accrued on a phantom share basis, as if the deferred amounts were invested in our ordinary shares, with earned dividends reinvested in shares. Under the DIC Plan II, prior to the beginning of each calendar year, participants must elect the method and timing of payment with respect to the incentive compensation to be earned in the year that is subject to the deferral election. The creation of the DIC Plan II and the exclusion of deferrals under the prior plan were implemented to satisfy the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (409A). Beginning with deferrals of short-term incentive compensation earned during 2008 and after for payment following retirement, each executive will have a choice of deferring up to 100% of his or her annual incentive compensation into either or both of (a) an account tracked on a phantom share basis and paid out in our ordinary shares or (b) an account that earns interest equal to that paid on 10-year Treasury Notes plus 300 basis points. Executives also may defer compensation under the DIC Plan II on a short-term basis for payment within 5 years or less.
IC Deferral Plan — Similarly, cash settled long-term incentive compensation earned after December 31, 2004 is eligible for deferral under the IC Deferral Plan II. Under the IC Deferral Plan II, prior to the beginning of any award period for which an award may be earned, or later if permitted by us in the case of performance-based compensation (as defined in the final regulations under 409A), participants must elect the method and timing of payment with respect to the incentive compensation to be earned during that award period, and that is subject to the deferral election. When an executive elects to defer a long-term incentive award under the IC Deferral Plan II for payment at or following his or her retirement, earnings on a minimum of 50% of the deferred amount must be tracked on a phantom share basis. The remainder of the amount deferred to retirement earns interest equivalents equal to that paid on 10-year Treasury Notes plus 300 basis points. At retirement, the portion of the executive's account that is deferred into phantom shares is paid in our ordinary shares. Incentive compensation deferred pursuant to our deferral plans is unsecured, subject to the claims of our creditors and is exposed to the risk of our non-payment.
A grantor trust that we previously established, the assets of which are subject to the claims of our creditors, will be used to pay those obligations related to deferred incentive compensation earned by our executives prior to 2005. The transaction to acquire Cooper Industries plc required Eaton to fund the vested liabilities in the trust in the amount of $7.8 million. No comparable trust arrangements currently are in place with respect to incentive compensation deferred after 2004.
None of the named executive officers have elected to participate in the non-qualified deferred compensation plans described above.

2018 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION
A named executive officer may experience a termination of employment under several possible situations. In each of these circumstances, certain plans, agreements, arrangements or practices would provide compensation to the executive in varying amounts. We do not provide employment contracts to our executives and do not have plans or arrangements (other than the Change of Control Agreements previously discussed and standard severance benefits available to all U.S. salaried, nonunion employees) that would require any payment to a named executive officer in the event of a termination of his or her employment.
Instead, the Compensation and Organization Committee of our Board of Directors exercises the sole discretion to decide what, if any, additional severance payments or benefits will be offered to an executive in the case of a termination of employment. In exercising this discretion, the Committee takes a number of factors into consideration, including the reasons for the termination and the individual executive's personal circumstances. The Committee believes that it is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to ensure that a departing executive is treated fairly and in a manner that will help us to secure appropriate confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and general release agreements. Moreover, providing fair and reasonable employment termination compensation is consistent with our overall compensation philosophy.
For each of the termination of employment scenarios described in this section, the estimated potential payments and benefits that might be received by each named executive officer are displayed in the table that immediately follows that description.
Background and Basic Assumptions 
In this section, we discuss termination of employment scenarios that include: (a) Voluntary Resignation or a Termination for Cause; (b) Normal and Early Retirement; (c) Involuntary Termination — Not for Cause; (d) Change of Control; and (e) Death or Disability. The following key principles and assumptions apply to these disclosures:
Under each of the scenarios, we have assumed that each of the named executive officer's employment terminated on December 31, 2018.
Each officer's eligibility for the amounts reported as severance payments and benefit arrangements are based on his or her compensation and years of service as of December 31, 2018.
An executive would be eligible for a full award under the short-term incentive plan for the year ending December 31, 2018 and a full award under a long-term incentive plan for any long-term performance-based award period ending December 31, 2018 if such an award had been payable. We would calculate and pay any such earned awards in accordance with the normal operation of the plans. Therefore, we have not included these awards in the following scenarios because they do not represent a severance or other payment that is triggered by employment termination.
We maintain a Severance Benefit Plan in which each of the named executive officers participates along with all of our U.S. salaried, non-union employees. We generally pay benefits under this Plan only in the case of an involuntary termination of employment other than for Cause. We calculate the benefits under this plan based on the length of service with us from the most recent date of hire. The maximum severance payment under this plan equals one year of base salary and continuation of health and welfare benefits for six months. However, the severance payment that we would expect to provide to a named executive officer under the scenarios described on the following pages would be made in lieu of any benefit under these standard severance arrangements.
To the extent the Committee would decide that a terminated executive is eligible for pro-rated participation in one or more of the open award periods under our long-term incentive plans, the estimated pro-rated awards shown in the following scenarios reflect (a) credit for the total number of months of service with us from the start of an eligible award period through the executive's termination date as a percentage of the total number of months in the award period multiplied by (b) the officer's target award for each open award period. Although we show the aggregate amount of these estimated payments for the named executive officers as a lump sum amount, our practice would be to make the pro-rated payments to executives at the end of each of the award periods once actual performance under the plan is known, except in the case of a termination in connection with a change of control.
Under the terms of our standard form of stock option, RSA and RSU grant agreements for grants awarded prior to May 1, 2015, in the case of a change of control of the Company, vesting of all the executives' outstanding unvested equity grants would be accelerated. For grants awarded after May 1, 2015, acceleration only occurs if the acquiring company does not assume or replace the grants or if the executive is terminated in connection with the change in control of the Company.
Back to Contents
Except under very unusual circumstances, the Committee would not provide any increases, payment acceleration or other enhancements to the benefits previously earned or credited under our benefit plans or programs in connection with any of the termination scenarios. These plans and programs would include (a) all retirement income plans (including defined benefit, defined contribution and nonqualified retirement income plans), (b) health and welfare plans (including post-retirement medical and life insurance coverage), (c) any vested and accrued vacation and (d) any amounts credited to the executives' accounts under our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Payments of earned and vested amounts under these plans and programs are not included in the scenarios described below.
In these termination scenarios, we expect that the Committee would provide the executive (or, in the case of death, the estate or surviving spouse, if any) with continued reimbursement for the cost of income tax return preparation and estate and financial planning services for the year of and year following termination of employment. These reimbursements to the executives would be reported as imputed income and would be subject to ordinary income tax treatment. The estimated expense reimbursements shown in the scenarios below represent the approximate cost of this benefit based on the amount of each named executive officer's most recent reimbursement.
Voluntary Resignation or Termination for Cause 
An executive is not entitled to receive any additional forms of compensation or benefits, other than any accrued and vested vacation, deferral account balances and vested qualified and nonqualified retirement income, if he or she voluntarily resigns when he or she is not yet eligible for retirement or if his or her employment with us is terminated for Cause.
Normal and Early Retirement 
Each named executive officer is subject to mandatory retirement at age 65 and is eligible to elect voluntary retirement after having attained age 55 with ten or more years of service. Consistent with the policy applied to non-executive employees who were hired on or before December 31, 2001, in the event we involuntarily terminate an officer after the officer attained age 50 with ten or more years of service, he or she also would be treated as a retiree under the programs described below. As of December 31, 2018, Ms. Advaithi and Mr. Eubanks did not meet the age and service requirements to be treated as a retiree under these programs. This retirement scenario includes: 
pro-rated eligibility in the open award periods under our long-term incentive plan (ESIP);
vesting of the then unvested stock options, RSAs and RSUs according to the vesting schedule set forth in each grant agreement. For illustrative purposes, these awards are valued based on the closing price of our shares on the last trading day of 2018 ($68.66), regardless of when they vest; and reimbursement for the costs of income tax return preparation and estate and financial planning assistance for the year of and year following retirement.

Involuntary Termination — Not for Cause 
In the event of an involuntary termination (not for cause), the Committee typically would provide a named executive officer with the following items.
severance pay of up to two times the total of his or her base salary and target incentive award under our short-term incentive plan;
pro-rated eligibility in any open award periods under the long-term incentive plans in which the officer had participated for at least half of the award period as of the termination date;
In the case of a no-fault termination such as a reduction in force, the Committee may choose to accelerate the vesting of restricted share units that are scheduled to vest within the twelve month period following the termination date; 
continuation of health and welfare benefits for six months;
executive outplacement benefits; and
Back to Contents an officer who is involuntarily terminated after having reached eligibility for early retirement generally would receive the other pay and benefits outlined under "Normal and Early Retirement."

Change of Control
Another scenario under which a named executive officer's employment may terminate is through a qualifying termination in connection with a change of control of the Company. We have entered into Change of Control Agreements with each of our officers, including the named executive officers, which provide for payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment in the context of a change of control of the Company. In addition, as noted above in "Background and Basic Assumptions," under the terms of our standard form of equity grant agreements, in the case of a change of control of the Company, vesting of all the executives' outstanding unvested equity grants would be accelerated if the grants are not assumed or replaced by the acquiring company or if the executive is terminated in connection with the change in control.
The Change of Control Agreements that we have with our officers contain the following key provisions:
The agreement first becomes effective upon a change of control of the Company.
For the two years following the change of control, the agreement protects the executive officer from certain changes to his or her employment, position, duties, compensation and benefits.
If, during this two-year period, the successor company terminates the executive officer's employment other than for "Cause" (which includes the willful and continued failure of the executive to perform his or her duties, the executive's conviction of a felony involving dishonesty, or the executive's willful engagement in gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company) or "Disability" or if the executive terminates his or her employment for "Good Reason" (which includes the assignment to the executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the executive's position; failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of the Change of Control Agreement (other than inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith); the Company requiring the executive to be based at any office or location that differs from what is specified in the Change of Control Agreement; or the Company requiring the executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than was required immediately prior to the change of control), the executive would receive:
A lump sum cash payment equal to the aggregate of (1) any earned but as yet unpaid base salary and short-term and long-term incentive awards (ESIP) for completed incentive award periods, (2) a prorated portion of his or her target opportunity for any open ESIP award periods and (3) the executive's annual base salary and target incentive opportunity under the short-term plan multiplied by three;
Continued health and welfare benefits for a period of two years, as if the executive's employment had not been terminated.
Two years of the payment described in (3) above represents a severance payment and one year is in exchange for an agreement not to complete with us for a period of one year following the termination date.
To the extent that any payments under the Change of Control Agreements are deferred compensation and the executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations thereunder (determined in accordance with the methodology established by us as of the date of termination of employment), such payments or other benefits will not be paid or provided before the first business day that is six months after the date of termination of employment.
No executives receive tax protection on payments made in connection with a change in control.
As is common practice with such agreements, these payments and benefits would not be subject to any requirement that the officer seek other employment or any other form of mitigation. We would pay the officer's legal fees if he or she needed to take action to enforce the provisions of the agreement or defend the agreement's terms if contested by us.

In the event of the death or disability of a named executive officer, the executive or the estate, whichever is appropriate, would receive pro-rated payments for any open award periods under our long-term incentive plan (ESIP). In addition, the Committee could exercise its discretion to accelerate the vesting or allow the continued vesting of any unvested stock options, RSUs and RSAs. These amounts are shown for each named executive officer in the table below.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
We are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Arnold, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified our median employee using our global population of approximately 99,000 regular employees and approximately 2,170 temporary employees as of October 1, 2018. In compliance with Item 402(u), we excluded all employees in 6 countries totaling 4,888 employees (approximately 4.8% of our total workforce of 101,168). Employees in the following countries were excluded: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Country  Headcount  
Philippines  2,982  
Serbia  650  
Thailand  607  
Morocco  417  
Indonesia  207  
Ukraine  25  
[END TABLE]
As a result, our pay ratio includes 96,280 of our employees in over 50 countries. We have chosen annual base salary as the consistently applied compensation measure used to identify the median employee. Base salary is the primary compensation component for a large portion of our workforce and is the one pay component that has a similar definition and is reported in a similar manner globally. Therefore, annual base salary provides an accurate depiction of total earnings for the purpose of identifying our median employee. Base salaries for employees outside the United States were converted to United States Dollars by applying the applicable exchange rates in effect on October 1, 2018.  No cost of living adjustments were applied in our methodology. 
Our median employee for 2018 is not the same employee that was used in the 2017 CEO Pay Ratio calculation. Although there were no changes to our compensation programs or population that would have a material impact on our pay ratio, we identified a new median employee because the employee used in the 2017 calculation received a promotion. Our 2018 median employee is in the same salary band, job title, and location that our 2017 median employee was in when we calculated our 2017 CEO Pay Ratio; however, the additional components of pay beyond base salary as described below vary from employee to employee within that grouping. 
Our median employee's total compensation of $55,585 was calculated in the same manner as we calculated total compensation for each of the named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table and includes base salary, overtime pay, recognition bonus amounts, employer contributions to retirement plans, and employer contributions to health and welfare benefits. Mr. Arnold's total compensation for purposes of this disclosure is $14,691,178 and also includes contributions to health and welfare benefits (which are properly excluded from the Summary Compensation Table). Accordingly, our CEO to Employee Pay Ratio is 264:1.

2018 Director Compensation
Non-employee directors receive their retainer in approximately an equal mix of cash ($150,000) and equity ($150,000). Compensation for our non-employee directors was structured as follows:
Cash Compensation 
2018 DIRECTOR CASH COMPENSATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annual cash service retainer for all Board members  $150,000  
Additional Committee service retainers:     
   Lead Director   $40,000  
   Audit Committee Chair   $30,000  
   Compensation and Organization Committee Chair   $30,000  
   Finance Committee Chair   $20,000  
   Governance Committee Chair   $20,000  
   Audit Committee members   $15,000  
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors may defer payment of their fees as described in "Other Plans and Benefits" below and in footnote (4) to the table on page 55.
Equity Compensation 
Restricted Share Units Granted in 2018 — Under our Stock Plan as approved by our shareholders, non-employee directors also receive RSUs with a value that is approximately equal to the annual cash retainer in effect on the grant date ($150,000 for 2018). The 2018 RSUs were granted Tuesday, February 27, 2018. The number of units a director received was based on the average New York Stock Exchange closing price of our ordinary shares over the first thirty trading days of the year. RSUs receive dividend equivalents that are reinvested as RSUs. The Governance Committee sets the terms and conditions for non-employee director RSUs. No additional equity awards may be granted to our non-employee directors under any of our other stock plans.
Determining Compensation 
The Governance Committee considers a number of factors when determining non-employee director compensation and the components thereof. One of many factors is the compensation level and compensation mix delivered to non-employee directors at the 24 companies in our Compensation Peer Group listed on page 29, and 13 other companies that, like Eaton, are domiciled in Ireland (11 of 13) or the United Kingdom (2 of 13). The 13 additional companies include:

[END TABLE]
With the assistance of its independent Executive Compensation Consultant, the Governance Committee periodically conducts formal external market pay studies, using the two peer groups listed above. It is our objective to provide total compensation at the median of both the compensation peer group and the additional Ireland (and U.K.) domiciled companies. Currently, total compensation is set at the approximate median external market value.
Robust Holding Requirement 
RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest at retirement, thereby creating a robust holding requirement. We measure actual ownership relative to a threshold holding requirement of five times the annual cash retainer. Directors are expected to reach that level of ownership within five years of joining our Board.
Back to Contents
Anti-Hedging and Pledging 
We also have a policy that prohibits directors from pledging or engaging in financial hedging of their investment risk in our shares.
Other Plans and Benefits 
Under the Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plans adopted by the Board, non-employee directors can elect to defer fees earned in cash. The rate of return varies depending on whether the director elected to defer the fees as retirement compensation or as short-term compensation as described in footnote (4) in the table below.
Non-employee directors who were initially elected to the Board prior to 2008 are provided access to certain health and welfare benefit arrangements, which include $100,000 in group term life insurance and participation in medical and dental coverage designed to mirror benefits provided to our employees. Former non-employee directors retain the following benefits after retirement: group term life insurance, with coverage reduced to $33,333; and medical (but not dental) coverage. Both current and retired non-employee directors are entitled to participate in the same gift matching program that is available to all of our current and retired employees. Under this program we match contributions to qualified charitable organizations dollar-for-dollar up to a maximum of $5,000 in any calendar year.
The table below shows the compensation and benefits applicable to our non-employee directors for 2018.

Granting the Board Authority to Issue Shares 
Under Irish law, directors of an Irish public limited company must have authority from its shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company's authorized but unissued share capital. On April 25, 2018, shareholders granted the Board authority to issue shares, with such authority to expire on October 24, 2019. We are presenting this proposal to renew the Board's authority to issue our authorized shares. We understand that it is customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to issue up to 33% of a company's issued ordinary share capital and for such authority to be limited to a period of 12 to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking approval to authorize the Board to issue up to a maximum of 33% of our issued ordinary share capital as of February 28, 2019, for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, revoked or renewed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to propose renewal of this authorization on a regular basis at our annual general meetings in subsequent years.
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish market practice. This authority is fundamental to our business and enables us to issue shares, including, if applicable, in connection with funding acquisitions and raising capital. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital or to approve a specific issuance of shares. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board the authority to issue shares that are already authorized under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. In addition, we note that, because we are a NYSE-listed company, our shareholders continue to benefit from the protections afforded to them under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and SEC, including those rules that limit our ability to issue shares in specified circumstances.
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of this proposal is an ordinary resolution that requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast.
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AS FOLLOWS:
"That the directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorized with effect from the passing of this resolution to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities (within the meaning of section 1021 of the Companies Act 2014) up to an aggregate nominal amount of $11,180,687,062 (140,161,553 shares) (being equivalent to approximately 33% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of February 28, 2019 (the latest practicable date before this proxy statement)), and the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked; provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this authority, which would or might require any such securities to be allotted after this authority has expired, and in that case, the directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired."

Granting the Board Authority to Opt-Out of Pre-emption Rights 
Under Irish law, unless otherwise authorized, when an Irish public limited company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders of the company on a pro-rata basis (commonly referred to as pre-emption rights). On April 25, 2018, shareholders granted the Board authority to opt-out of pre-emption rights, with such authority to expire on October 24, 2019. We are presenting this proposal to renew the Board's authority to opt-out of the pre-emption rights.
We understand that it is customary practice in Ireland to seek shareholder authority to opt-out of the pre-emption rights provision in the event of (1) the issuance of shares in connection with any rights issue and (2) the issuance of shares for cash, if the issuance is limited to up to 5% of a company's issued ordinary share capital (with the possibility of issuing an additional 5% of the company's issued ordinary share capital provided the company uses it only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issuance, or which has taken place in the preceding 6-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue) bringing the total acceptable limit to 10% of the company's issued ordinary share capital. It is also customary practice for such authority to be limited to a period of 12 to 18 months. Therefore, in accordance with customary practice in Ireland, we are seeking this authority for a period expiring 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless otherwise varied, renewed or revoked. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to propose renewal of this authorization on a regular basis at our annual general meetings in subsequent years.
Granting the Board this authority is a routine matter for public companies incorporated in Ireland and is consistent with Irish customary practice. Similar to the authorization sought for Proposal 4, this authority is fundamental to our business and, if applicable, will facilitate our ability to fund acquisitions and otherwise raise capital. We are not asking you to approve an increase in our authorized share capital. Instead, approval of this proposal will only grant the Board the authority to issue shares in the manner already permitted under our Articles of Association upon the terms below. Without this authorization, in each case where we issue shares for cash, we would first have to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to all of our existing shareholders. This requirement could cause delays in the completion of acquisitions and capital raising for our business. Furthermore, we note that this authorization is required as a matter of Irish law and is not otherwise required for other companies listed on the NYSE.
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of this proposal is a special resolution that requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast. In addition, under Irish law, the Board may only be authorized to opt-out of pre-emption rights if it is authorized to issue shares, which authority is being sought in Proposal 4.
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AS FOLLOWS:
"RESOLVED, As a special resolution, that, subject to the passing of the resolution in respect of Proposal 4 as set out above and with effect from the passing of this resolution, the directors be and are hereby empowered pursuant to Section 1023 of the Companies Act 2014 to allot equity securities (as defined in Section 1023 of that Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by Proposal 4 as if sub-section (1) of Section 1022 did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this power shall be limited to:
the allotment of equity securities in connection with a rights issue in favor of the holders of ordinary shares (including rights to subscribe for, or convert into, ordinary shares) where the equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of such holders are proportional (as nearly as may be) to the respective numbers of ordinary shares held by them (but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or expedient to deal with fractional entitlements that would otherwise arise, or with legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of any recognized regulatory body or any stock exchange in any territory, or otherwise); and
Back to Contents the allotment (other than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above) of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal value of $3,388,086,989 (42,473,198 shares) (being equivalent to approximately 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of February 28, 2019 (the latest practicable date before this proxy statement)), provided that any amount above $1,694,043,494 (21,236,599 shares) (being equivalent to approximately 5% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as of February 28, 2019) is to be used only for the purpose of an acquisition or a specific capital investment, and the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire 18 months from the passing of this resolution, unless previously renewed, varied or revoked; provided that the Company may make an offer or agreement before the expiry of this authority, which would or might require any such securities to be allotted after this authority has expired, and in that case, the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired."

Authorization of the Company and Any Subsidiary of the Company to Make Overseas Market Purchases of Company Shares 
We historically have used open-market share purchases to return value to shareholders and manage the number of our outstanding shares. For Irish companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Irish Companies Act defines market purchases as "overseas market purchases." During 2018, we repurchased approximately $1.3 billion of our ordinary shares in open-market purchases. These transactions were effected under our existing board-approved share repurchase program as redemptions pursuant to Article 5(b)(iv) of our Articles of Association. Whether or not this proposed resolution is passed, the Company will retain its ability to effect repurchases as redemptions pursuant to its Articles of Association, although subsidiaries will not be able to make open-market purchases of ordinary shares. Passage of this proposal would give the Company flexibility under Irish law to permit subsidiaries to make the purchases.
In this proposal, shareholders are being asked to authorize for a period of 18 months, the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, to make open market purchases of up to 40,000,000 of our ordinary shares, which represents 9.4% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares as of December 31, 2018, as and when directed by any plan or program approved by the Board of Directors.
On April 25, 2018, the shareholders of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 40,000,000 ordinary shares. Pursuant to its terms, that authority remains valid for 18 months. Accordingly, unless reapproved at this year's annual general meeting, that authority will expire on the close of business on October 24, 2019.
In connection with the parameters established with the Board regarding our share repurchase programs, these purchases would be made only at price levels that the directors would consider to be in the best interests of the shareholders generally, after taking into account the Company's overall financial position. In addition, the price that may be paid for these shares shall not be less than 70% or more than 120% of the then closing market price of those shares on the New York Stock Exchange the day preceding the day on which the relevant shares are purchased.
As required under Irish law, the resolution in respect of this proposal is an ordinary resolution that requires the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast.
THE TEXT OF THE RESOLUTION IN RESPECT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AS FOLLOWS:
RESOLVED "The Company and any subsidiary of the Company are hereby generally authorized to make overseas market purchases of the Company's ordinary shares, par value US$0.01 each ("shares"), on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Board of Directors of the Company may determine from time to time but subject to the following provisions:
The maximum number of shares authorized to be acquired by the Company and any subsidiaries of the Company pursuant to this resolution shall not exceed 40,000,000 shares.
The maximum price to be paid for any share shall not be more than 120% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for the shares on the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is purchased by the Company or the relevant subsidiary of the Company.
The minimum price to be paid for any share shall not be less than 70% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange for the shares on the day preceding the day on which the relevant share is purchased by the Company or the relevant subsidiary of the Company.
This general authority will be effective from the date of passing of this resolution.

These plans are the 2005 Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan, the 1996 Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan, the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan II and the Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan II, none of which are considered "equity compensation plans" requiring shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. For a description of these plans, please see "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on page 48 and footnote (4) to the table on page 55.
Includes an aggregate of 4,658,820 stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $63.39 and a weighted average remaining life of 5.2 years, and 3,228,648 restricted share awards, restricted share units and performance share units.
Represents shares underlying phantom share units, payable on a one-for-one basis, credited to accounts under the deferral plans listed in footnote (2) above.
The weighted average exercise price of outstanding stock options excludes PSUs, RSAs, RSUs and deferred compensation share units because they have no exercise price.
As described under "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on page 48, executives may elect to defer receipt of their earned cash bonuses under the short-term or long-term incentive plans. These deferred amounts are invested as Company share units and valued at the then current fair market value under the Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan II or the Incentive Compensation Deferral Plan II, whichever plan is applicable. We do not provide any share or cash match with respect to the deferred amounts under these plans, nor do we allow executives to defer the receipt of shares earned under any of our Stock Plans. Likewise, non-employee directors may elect to have their fees paid in cash invested as share units which are valued at the then current fair market price under the 2005 Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan or, for fees earned on or after January 1, 2013, the 2013 Non-Employee Director Fee Deferral Plan. We do not provide any share or cash match with respect to the directors' fees deferred under these plans, nor do we allow directors to defer the receipt of shares earned under any of our Stock Plans. Because the amount of these cash bonuses and directors' fees are determined under specific processes described in this proxy statement, the number of share units credited and shares received under these deferral plans is limited. The share units described herein are not expensed by the Company because they are not considered equity compensation for the purposes of ASC Topic 718.

ADMISSION TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
Shareholders who plan to attend the 2019 annual general meeting may obtain admission tickets at the Registration Desk immediately prior to the meeting. Shareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a broker or bank should obtain certification of ownership to bring to the meeting. If you obtained a legal proxy from your broker, you must bring this legal proxy to the annual general meeting in order to vote in person. 
PROXY SOLICITATION
Eaton's Board of Directors solicits your proxy for use at the 2019 annual general meeting of shareholders and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting.
In addition to soliciting proxies over the Internet and through the mail, certain persons may solicit proxies in person or by telephone or fax. Eaton has retained The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC, 18 East 41st Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10017, to assist in the solicitation of proxies, primarily from brokers, banks and other nominees, for a fee of $25,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Brokerage firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries may be asked to forward proxy soliciting material to the beneficial shareholders. All reasonable soliciting costs will be borne by Eaton.
HOW PROXIES WILL BE VOTED
The individuals named in the enclosed form of proxy or on-line have advised the Board of their intention to vote at the meeting in accordance with instructions on all proxy forms submitted by shareholders and, where no contrary instruction is indicated on the proxy form, as follows: for the election of the individuals nominated to serve as directors, for the appointment of Ernst & Young as independent auditor for 2019 and authorizing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to set its remuneration, for advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation, for granting the Board authority to issue shares under Irish law, for granting the Board authority to opt-out of pre-emption rights under Irish law, and for the authorization of overseas market purchases of Company shares.
You may revoke a proxy by submitting a later-dated proxy, by notifying Eaton by fax, email or other verifiable communication before the meeting, or by revoking it at the meeting. All properly executed or transmitted proxies not revoked will be voted at the meeting.
VOTING AT THE MEETING
Each Eaton shareholder of record at the close of business on February 25, 2019 is entitled to one vote for each share then held. On that date, 424,223,214 Eaton ordinary shares (par value US $0.01 each) were outstanding and entitled to vote.
At the 2019 annual general meeting, the inspector of election appointed by the Board of Directors for the meeting will determine the presence of a quorum and tabulate the results of shareholder voting. As provided by the Company's Articles of Association, three shareholders present in person or by proxy at the meeting will constitute a quorum. The inspector of election intends to treat as "present" for these purposes shareholders who have submitted properly executed and transmitted proxies even if marked "abstain" as to some matters. The inspector will also treat as "present" shares held in "street name" by brokers that are voted on at least one proposal to come before the meeting.
Adoption of Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of ordinary shares represented at the annual general meeting in person or by proxy. Adoption of Proposal 5 requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast by the holders of ordinary shares represented at the meeting in person or by proxy.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast at the annual general meeting. Therefore, abstentions and shares held in "street name" by brokers that are not voted in respect of these proposals will not have any practical effect on the outcome of voting on the proposals.
There is no requirement under Irish law that Eaton's Irish Statutory Accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 or the related directors' and auditor's reports thereon be approved by the shareholders, and no such approval will be sought at the annual general meeting.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's directors and executive officers to file reports of holdings and transactions in the Company's equity securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company assists its directors and executive officers by completing and filing these reports electronically on their behalf. Based on a review of copies of these reports provided to us and written representations from directors and executive officers, we believe that all filing requirements were met during fiscal year 2018.
FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS 
Shareholders who wish to submit proposals for inclusion in the proxy statement and for consideration at the annual general meeting must do so on a timely basis. In order to be included in the proxy statement for the 2020 annual general meeting pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 14a-8, proposals must relate to proper subjects and must be received by the Company Secretary, Eaton Corporation plc, Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2, by November 15, 2019. Any shareholder proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 14a-8 but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2020 annual general meeting must be received by the Company Secretary at the address listed above no earlier than November 15, 2019 and no later than December 15, 2019 and must satisfy the other requirements set forth in our Articles of Association. Securities and Exchange Commission rules permit management to vote proxies in its discretion in certain cases if the shareholder does not comply with this deadline and in certain other cases notwithstanding the shareholder's compliance with this deadline.
Any shareholder of record wishing to nominate an individual for election as a director must follow the procedures and provide the information set forth in our Articles of Association by the dates set forth above for proposals that are sought to be presented directly at the 2020 annual general meeting. If director nominees are being proposed for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 annual general meeting, notice must be provided no later than November 15, 2019 and no earlier than October 16, 2019, and the shareholders and nominees must satisfy the other requirements set forth in our Articles of Association.
MAILINGS TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD
Unless you or another shareholder at your mailing address has requested a separate mailing, all Eaton shareholders receiving proxy materials by mail at your mailing address who share the same last name have been sent a single copy of the proxy statement, 2018 annual report and Irish Statutory Accounts. This method of delivery is known as "householding." Householding reduces the number of mailings you receive, saves printing and postage costs, and helps the environment. Shareholders receiving proxy materials by mail who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. We will deliver promptly, upon written or telephone request, a separate copy of the proxy statement, 2018 annual report and Irish Statutory Accounts to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. A shareholder who wishes to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials now or in the future should submit this request in writing to Eaton Corporation plc, Attention: Company Secretary, Eaton House, 30 Pembroke Road, Dublin 4, Ireland D04 Y0C2, or contact our Investor Relations department by telephone at 440-523-4059. Shareholders of record sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive a single copy of such materials in the future should submit their request by contacting us in the same manner. If you are the beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of Eaton ordinary shares and wish to receive only one copy of the proxy materials in the future, you will need to contact your broker, bank or other nominee to request that only a single copy of these documents be mailed to all shareholders at the shared address.
