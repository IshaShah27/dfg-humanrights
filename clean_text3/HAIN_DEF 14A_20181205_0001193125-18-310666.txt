Over the last 25 years, Hain Celestial has offered authentic, high-quality, and mission-driven brands within the organic, natural and better-for-you products industry that increasingly resonate with today's global consumer. We operate in an ever-changing environment for food manufacturers and retailers, and, as we look to the future, our success will be driven by our ability to remain true to our mission and purpose, reduce complexity within our business, invest in our core better-for-you brands for growth, expand relationships with new and existing customers and attract new consumers. As consumers increasingly choose their purchases based on health and well-being, ingredient transparency and environmental sustainability, we believe our ability to operate our businesses with a greater sense of purpose will continue to differentiate us. 
During fiscal year 2018, we continued to strategically evaluate our business to best position Hain Celestial for the future. We made the strategic decision to divest our Hain Pure Protein business, and we continue to evaluate initiatives to reduce the complexity within our business. Under Project Terra, we have identified substantial cost savings opportunities and seek to drive growth and profitability through streamlining our operations, the rationalization of our product portfolio, improving efficiencies and building brand awareness. 
We remain focused on four key initiatives, which we refer to as our Four-Point Strategic Plan:

STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Last year, our stockholders approved our Say on Pay resolution with 70.3% of the votes cast voting in favor, which represented a significant improvement over the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders where only 41% of the votes cast supported our Say on Pay resolution. We believe that the improvement in last year's Say on Pay resolution resulted from the significant compensation and governance actions the Company took in response to its extensive stockholder outreach efforts after the 2015 Annual Meeting as follows:

If, on October 15, 2018, your shares were registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, then you are a stockholder of record, and our proxy materials were provided to you directly. Registered stockholders can vote any one of four ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone: Call 1-800-690-6903 from the United States. You will need to use the control number you were provided on your proxy card. You will need to follow the instructions given by the voice prompts.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet: Go to www.proxyvote.com to vote via the Internet using the control number you were  provided on your proxy card. You will need to follow the instructions on the website.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail: If you received a paper copy of the proxy materials and a proxy card in the mail, you may mark,  sign, date and return your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you sign and return your proxy card, but do not give voting instructions, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board as described in  this proxy statement. If any other matters are properly brought up at the Annual Meeting (other than the proposals contained in this proxy statement), then the named proxies will have the authority to vote your shares on those matters in accordance  with their discretion and judgment. The Board currently does not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals contained in this proxy statement. If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, your electronic vote  authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you signed, dated and returned a proxy card by mail.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In Person: Attend the Annual Meeting or send a personal representative with an appropriate proxy to vote at  the meeting. For information about how to attend the Annual Meeting, please see "What do I need to be admitted to the Annual Meeting?" below.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank 
If, on October 15, 2018, your shares were held in an account at a broker, bank or other agent, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name", and our proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. You may vote by submitting your voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone or by mail as indicated above. Please refer to the information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. 
What do I need to be admitted to the Annual Meeting? 
You will need a form of personal identification (such as a driver's license) along with either your proxy card or proof of stock ownership to enter the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held beneficially in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record and you wish to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you must present proof of your ownership of The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement. 
Can I vote at the Annual Meeting? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote at the Annual Meeting any shares that were registered in your name as the stockholder of record as of the record date. To vote in person, come to the Annual Meeting, and we will give you a ballot. 
If you are a beneficial owner, you are not a holder of record of those shares and cannot vote them at the Annual Meeting unless you have a legal proxy from the holder of record. If you plan to attend and vote your shares held in "street name" at the Annual Meeting, you should request a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other holder of record and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we strongly encourage you to vote by proxy prior to the Annual Meeting. 
For information about how to attend the Annual Meeting, please see "What do I need to be admitted to the Annual Meeting?" 
What if I return a proxy card but do not make specific choices? 
If you return a signed and dated proxy card without marking any voting selections, your shares will be voted as follows:

[END TABLE]
The Company does not expect that any matters other than those described in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement to be brought before the Annual Meeting. The persons appointed as proxies will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournments thereof, including any vote to postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting. 
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. We expect that the solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail. Proxies may also be solicited by our officers and employees, at no additional cost to us, in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. We have retained the proxy solicitation firm of MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist us in the distribution and solicitation of proxies, and we intend to pay a fee of approximately $12,500, plus reasonable expenses, for these services. We may reimburse custodians, nominees and fiduciaries holding our common stock for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their proxy. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
If you receive more than one proxy card, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
How do I revoke my proxy? 
If, on October 15, 2018, you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy if we receive your revocation at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by sending a written notice stating that you are revoking your proxy before it is voted at the Annual Meeting to the Corporate Secretary at The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, New York 11042 or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
If, on October 15, 2018, you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, your ability to revoke your proxy depends on the voting procedures of the broker, bank or other agent. Please follow the directions provided to you by your bank or broker. 
How are votes counted? 
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count "For" and "Against" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. 
How are broker non-votes and abstentions counted? 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions with respect to that proposal from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes on a proposal are not counted or deemed present or represented and entitled to vote for determining whether stockholders have approved that proposal. Therefore, broker non-votes have no effect and will not be counted towards the vote total for any proposal. 
Under the rules that govern brokers who are voting with respect to shares held in "street name" and are not instructed by their client how to vote, brokers only have the discretion to vote those shares on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. Routine matters include ratification of registered independent accountants. Non-routine matters include the election of directors and the advisory vote regarding compensation paid to our named executive officers. If you are a beneficial owner and do not provide specific voting instructions to your broker, the organization that holds your shares will not be authorized to vote on Proposal Nos. 1 and 2 and will only have discretion to vote on Proposal No. 3, the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our registered independent accountants for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. 
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal? 
With respect to Proposal No. 1, each director must receive a "For" vote from the majority of votes cast either in person or by proxy. Pursuant to our Amended and Restated By-Laws, this means that, in order to be elected, the number of votes "For" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "Against" that director. With respect to Proposal No. 1, shares voting "abstain" and broker non-votes have no effect. 
To be approved, Proposal Nos. 2 and 3 must receive a "For" vote from the majority of votes cast either in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter. With respect to Proposal Nos. 2 or 3, shares voting "abstain" and broker non-votes have no effect. 
What is the quorum requirement? 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid Annual Meeting. A quorum will exist if at least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are present in person or represented by proxy. On the record date, there were 108,506,686 shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Thus, 54,253,343 shares must be represented in person or by proxy to have a quorum. 
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker or bank) or if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the chairman of the Annual Meeting or holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting may adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting to another time or date. 
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting? 
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. We will publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") within four business days of the Annual Meeting. After the Form 8-K is filed, you may obtain a copy by visiting our website or contacting our Investor Relations Department by calling (516) 587-5000, by writing to the Investor Relations Department, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, New York 11042 or by sending an email to investorrelations@hain.com.  
PROPOSAL NO. 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Cooperation Agreement 
On September 27, 2017, we entered into a cooperation agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with certain entities affiliated with and investment funds managed by Engaged Capital, LLC (the "Engaged Group"), which provides that all of the current directors will be nominated for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In addition, during the standstill period (the "Standstill Period"), which began on the date of the Cooperation Agreement and extends through and includes the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, neither the Board nor any committee of the Board may modify the size of the Board from 11 directors without the unanimous approval of the Board. Our Board is currently composed of 11 members. The Board has unanimously approved the reduction in the size of the Board to nine directors, such reduction to be effective as of the Annual Meeting. 
General 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of 11 members, of which eight of the current directors will stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. In connection with Mr. Simon resigning from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Simon has decided not to stand for re-election and, instead, has entered into a consulting agreement in order to provide for an orderly transition to the incoming Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Board has nominated Mark Schiller, the Company's incoming President and Chief Executive Officer, to serve as a director on the Board. It is proposed that the nominees standing for election be elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. In addition to Mr. Simon, Adrianne Shapira and Lawrence S. Zilavy are not standing for re-election, and the Company thanks them for their service and many contributions to the Company.

Over the years, she has previously served on boards and chaired committees for multiple marketing and media entities, including the Data and Marketing Association's (DMA) Board from 2008 to 2015, where she was a voting director and on the executive committee. 
Key Attributes, Experience and Skills: 
Ms. Zier is qualified to serve on our Board based on her extensive management leadership experience, which has provided her with significant knowledge of sound corporate governance practices, as well as her international experience and financial acumen. In addition, she has significant experience in the food industry and digital marketing, which makes her a valuable contributor to the Board. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors 
The stockholders of the Company elect the Board of Directors, whose primary responsibility is to foster the long-term health, overall success and financial condition of the Company, consistent with its fiduciary duty to our stockholders. The Board serves as the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved to or shared with the stockholders. The Board oversees the members of senior management, who are charged by the Board with conducting the business of the Company. In addition, the Board has responsibility for establishing broad corporate policies and overseeing our direction, affairs and management. 
Director Independence 
A majority of the current Board, consisting of Mses. Clark, Shapira and Zier as well as Messrs. Heyer, Hollis, Korangy, Meltzer, Sinclair, Welling and Zilavy, are "independent directors" as defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). Mr. Simon was determined not to be independent because he is our President and CEO. 
Board Meetings and Attendance 
The Board typically holds regular meetings at least once every quarter and holds special meetings when necessary. During the 2018 fiscal year, the Board held eight meetings. We expect directors to attend Board meetings, the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and meetings of the committees on which they serve. All directors standing for re-election attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which they served during the fiscal year. All of the directors standing for re-election attended our last Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board has no policy with respect to the need to separate or combine the offices of Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Company. The Board believes that stockholders are best served if the Board retains flexibility to decide what leadership structure works best for the Company based on the facts and circumstances existing from time to time. 
Mr. Simon currently serves as our Chairman of the Board, President and CEO and has been our President and CEO and a director since our inception and is our Founder. As a result, Mr. Simon possesses a great depth of knowledge and experience regarding the Company, its business and the organic and natural products industry. During his tenure, Mr. Simon focused on building organic, natural and better-for-you brands across numerous categories, both in the U.S. and internationally, to position Hain Celestial as a leader in the health and wellness products industry. His relentless dedication to providing consumers with A Healthier Way of Life™ has created a strong foundation to support Hain Celestial's next phase of growth. 
Given Mr. Simon's decision to not stand for re-election, he will no longer serve on the Board after the Annual Meeting and a new Chairman of the Board will be appointed. At this time, the Board expects to maintain separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles and to appoint an independent Chairman. 
We believe that a Lead Independent Director is necessary for good corporate governance in the absence of an Independent Chairman. Our current Lead Independent Director is Andrew R. Heyer. The Lead Independent Director is elected by a majority of independent directors to serve for a one-year term. The Board believes that the appointment of a strong Lead Independent Director and the use of regular executive sessions of the non-management and independent directors, along with the Board's strong committee system and the independence of all directors (except for Mr. Simon) allow it to maintain effective oversight of management. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Lead Independent Director shall: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  Preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman of the Board is not present, including all meetings of  independent Directors and non-employee Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii)  Encourage and facilitate active participation of all Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii)  Approve Board meeting materials for distribution to and consideration by the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv)  Approve Board meeting agendas after conferring with the Chairman of the Board and other members of the Board, as  appropriate, and may add agenda items in his or her discretion;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(v)  Approve Board meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(vi)  Be available to advise the Committee chairs in fulfilling their designated roles and responsibilities to the Board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(vii)  Perform such other functions as the Board or other Directors may request.  
[END TABLE]
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Management is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk management, and the Board's role is to engage in informed oversight of, and provide direction with respect to, such risk management. In its oversight role regarding risk management, the Board focuses on understanding the nature of our enterprise risks, including risk in our operations, finances, cyber security and the strategic direction of the Company and reviews and approves the Company's Annual Operating Plan. The Annual Operating Plan addresses, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing the Company. The Board receives regular updates regarding the Company's progress against its Annual Operating Plan and reviews quarterly updates regarding the related risks and opportunities. The Board maintains control over significant transactions and decisions that require Board approval for certain corporate actions (including material acquisitions or divestitures). 
The Board has delegated certain risk management oversight responsibilities to the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. 
As part of its responsibilities as set forth in its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for discussing with management the Company's policies and guidelines regarding risk assessment and risk management regarding the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures. 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the risk and reward structure of executive compensation plans, policies and practices. Considered in this review are program attributes deemed to help mitigate risk, including: (i) the use of multiple performance measures, balanced between short- and long-term objectives; (ii) the Compensation Committee's application of judgment when determining individual payouts; (iii) the presence of individual payout caps under plans and programs; and (iv) the Compensation Committee's ability to clawback incentive compensation based on erroneous financial statements caused by misconduct. Based upon this review, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation programs and policies are not likely to lead to excessive risk taking that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Executive Sessions 
Independent directors meet in executive session at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors without any members of management present. Mr. Heyer, as the Lead Independent Director, presides over meetings of independent directors. 
Director Elections 
All directors stand for election annually and are elected by a majority of the votes cast in the case of an uncontested election. Voting is not cumulative. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board of Directors has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. All members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are independent directors, as defined in the applicable listing rules for companies listed on Nasdaq. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, a current copy of which is available on our website at www.hain.com under Investor Relations-Corporate Governance. The members of the committees are identified in the table below:

The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board's oversight of (1) the integrity of the Company's financial statements, (2) the independent auditor's qualifications, independence and performance and (3) the performance of the Company's internal controls and procedures. In fulfilling its purpose, the Committee's principal duties include appointing, retaining and terminating our independent auditor, overseeing the work of and evaluating the independence of the independent auditor, reviewing with the independent auditor their reports as well as oversight responsibilities with respect to our financial statements, disclosure practices, accounting policies and procedures. 
Our Audit Committee is composed of Ms. Shapira and Messrs. Heyer and Korangy, with Mr. Heyer acting as chairperson. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee (1) is "independent" as defined by applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of Nasdaq, (2) has not participated in the preparation of our financial statements or those of any of our current subsidiaries at any time during the past three years and (3) is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. In addition, the Board has determined that each of Ms. Shapira and Messrs. Heyer and Korangy is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable SEC rules. Audit Committee members are not permitted to serve on the audit committees of more than two other public companies. During fiscal year 2018, our Audit Committee held eight meetings. See "Report of the Audit Committee." 
The Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee's duties include reviewing our compensation strategy on an annual basis to ensure that such strategy supports our objectives and stockholder interests and that executive officers are rewarded in a manner consistent with such strategy. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for, among other things, reviewing and approving annual and long-term performance measures relevant to executive officer compensation, evaluating the performance of the executive officers in light of these goals and objectives, approving the annual and long-term compensation awards for our executive officers and recommending to the independent members of the Board for their approval the form and amount of equity awards to be made to our executive officers. 
Our Compensation Committee is composed of Messrs. Sinclair, Welling and Zilavy, with Mr. Zilavy acting as chairperson. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is "independent" as defined by the listing standards of Nasdaq. During fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee held eight meetings in addition to numerous informal conference calls among committee members. 
Our Compensation Committee is authorized to engage an independent compensation consultant with respect to executive and director compensation matters. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee that was in place at the beginning of the fiscal year engaged Aon Hewitt as its independent compensation consultant. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged ClearBridge Compensation Group, LLC to conduct a peer group review, provide executive compensation market data, advise in connection with the CEO succession process and to review the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section of the proxy statement. 
The Compensation Committee believes that there was no conflict of interest between either Aon Hewitt or ClearBridge Compensation Group, LLC and the Company during their respective engagements. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered the factors set forth in the SEC rule regarding compensation advisor independence. Specifically, the Compensation Committee analyzed whether the work of ClearBridge Compensation Group, LLC as compensation consultant raised any conflict of interest, taking into consideration the following factors: (i) the provision of other services to the Company by the consultant; (ii) the amount of fees from the Company paid to the consultant as a percentage of the consultant's total revenue; (iii) the policies and procedures of the consultant that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of the consultant or the individual compensation advisors employed by the consultant with an executive officer of the Company; (v) any business or personal relationship of the individual compensation advisors with any member of the Compensation Committee; and (vi) any stock of the Company owned by the consultant or the individual compensation advisors employed by the consultant. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's duties require the Committee to, among other things, (1) identify individuals qualified to serve on the Board of Directors and to recommend that the Board of Directors select director nominees to be considered for election at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders or to be appointed by the Board of Directors to fill an existing or newly created vacancy on the Board of Directors, (2) identify members of the Board of Directors to serve on each board committee and to serve as chairman thereof and recommend each such member and chairman to the Board of Directors, (3) develop and revise, as appropriate, Corporate Governance Guidelines applicable to the Company and recommend such guidelines or the revision of such guidelines to the Board of Directors; (4) oversee the evaluation by the Board of Directors of itself and its committees and (5) review and assess the management succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer. 
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is composed of Mses. Clark and Zier and Mr. Hollis, with Ms. Zier acting as chairperson. The Board has determined that each member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is "independent" as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq. During fiscal year 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee held five meetings in addition to numerous informal conference calls among committee members. 
On June 25, 2018, the Company announced a Chief Executive Officer succession plan, whereby, upon the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Simon would resign from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer. Working with a leading global executive search firm, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee spearheaded the initiative on behalf of the Board to identify a successor for the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. On October 29, 2018, the Company announced the appointment of Mark Schiller as the Company's new President and Chief Executive Officer, effective November 5, 2018, as well as Schiller's nomination as a director of the Company, which is set forth under "Proposal No.1 – Election of Directors". 
Director Nominations 
When considering potential director nominees, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews desired experience, skills and other qualities to assure appropriate Board composition, taking into account the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board. In addition to these minimum requirements, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates director candidates based on a number of qualifications, including displayed ethical standards, integrity, sound business judgment and a willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding diversity, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to include members with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience, including appropriate financial and other expertise relevant to the business of the Company. Consistent with past practices, the Board is committed to a strong and diverse membership and to a thorough process to identify those individuals who can best contribute to the Company's continued success. 
The Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee begin the process of identifying and evaluating director nominees by seeking recommendations from a wide variety of contacts, including current executive officers and directors, and industry, academic and community leaders. The Board or the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may retain a search firm to identify and screen candidates, conduct background checks, prepare biographies for review by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board and assist in scheduling interviews. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and one or more of our other directors will interview candidates. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's charter provides that the Committee shall consider written proposals for director nominees from stockholders in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Amended and Restated By-Laws. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders, and a stockholder wishing to submit a recommendation should send a letter to our Corporate Secretary at The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Director Nominee Recommendation" and, in order to be considered for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, must be received by us no later than July 1, 2019. 
The letter must identify the author as a stockholder, demonstrate evidence of ownership, provide a complete listing of the candidate's qualifications to serve on the Board, the candidate's current principal occupation, most recent five-year employment history, current directorships and a statement that the proposed nominee has consented to the nomination, as well as contact information for both the candidate and the author of the letter. In addition, our By-Laws permit stockholders who satisfy certain ownership, notice and informational requirements to submit director nominations for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement. For more information regarding stockholder nominations and communications with our Board of Directors, see "Stockholder Proposals and Other Communications." 
Website Access to Corporate Governance Documents 
We have adopted a "Code of Ethics", as defined in the regulations of the SEC, which applies to all of our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Copies of the charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, are available free of charge on our website at www.hain.com or by writing to Investor Relations, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this proxy statement or incorporated into any of our other filings made with the SEC. 
Compensation of Directors 
We maintain a Non-Employee Directors' Compensation Plan that is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain highly qualified, non-employee directors; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of non-employee directors with those of our  stockholders by paying a portion of non-employee director compensation in shares of our restricted common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Directors who are also employees of the Company receive no additional compensation for their service on our Board. Accordingly, Mr. Simon did not receive any compensation for his Board service. 
Each year, the Compensation Committee and our Board of Directors review and determine compensation for our non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee and our Board believe that compensation should fairly compensate non-employee directors for work required in a company of our size and scope. Accordingly, compensation paid to non-employee directors in 2018 was as follows:

Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board strongly believes that the directors should have a meaningful ownership interest in the Company and, to that end, has implemented stock ownership guidelines for our directors. The ownership guidelines require directors to own, at a minimum, the value of five times the annual cash compensation (excluding additional cash compensation to committee chairpersons and members) in shares of Hain Celestial common stock within the later of five years after a director is first elected to the Board or five years after the implementation of the guidelines. All directors are currently in compliance with the guidelines or are expected to meet the stock ownership guidelines within the five-year period.

Executive Summary 
Our mission and operating strategy require that our compensation philosophy recognizes both near-term financial and operational success as well as decision-making that supports long-term value creating growth. For these reasons, the Company's executive compensation program has been designed to incentivize both near-term and long-term objectives by providing NEOs with both annual incentive and long-term incentive award opportunities. Demonstrating its thoughtful and complete approach, the Compensation Committee evaluates, on at least an annual basis, the Company's executive compensation practices to ensure that they are aligned with the Company's short-term goals and long-term strategic plan, are designed to drive both short-term and long-term growth and profitability, and are in the interests of our stockholders. 
Response to Say on Pay Vote 
Last year, our stockholders approved our Say on Pay resolution with 70.3% of the votes cast voting in favor, which represented a significant improvement over the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders where only 41% of the votes cast supported our Say on Pay resolution. We believe that the improvement in last year's Say on Pay resolution resulted from the significant compensation and governance actions the Company took in response to its extensive stockholder outreach campaign after the 2015 Annual Meeting as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Company should consider adopting a performance measure that is relative so that stockholders can better evaluate the Company's performance against its peers.    Adopted Relative TSR as one of the measures for the long-term incentive plan    Provides stockholders with the ability to evaluate the Company's performance against a predetermined peer group    2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 The Company should consider increasing the performance period under the long-term incentive plan from two years to three years    Increased the performance period under the long-term incentive plan to three years    Incentivizes long-term thinking and aligns management incentives with stockholders.    2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 The Company should further align pay and performance    Eliminated the time-based vesting portion of the long-term incentive award (25% of award)    All awards under the long- term incentive plan are 100% performance-based thereby increasing stockholder alignment    2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan 
 The Company should consider eliminating the use of a CEO Founder Peer Group    Eliminated the CEO Founder peer group. We are now using a single compensation peer group for all executive compensation decisions    Provides for clearer, more objective and more concise information    2016 
 The Board of Directors should consider appointing a lead independent director    The Board of Directors appointed a lead independent director    The lead independent director provides objective leadership to the independent directors in the Boardroom, presides over Board meetings, sets Board priorities  in conjunction with the Chairman and advises the Board on matters where there may be an actual or perceived conflict of interest    May 2017

 Proxy access is a right that is important to stockholders    The Board of Directors supported a stockholder proposal for proxy access in the 2015 proxy statement and submitted to stockholders a By-law amendment  implementing proxy access, which was approved by stockholders    Provides stockholders meeting certain requirements the right to nominate candidates for election to our Board and have their nominees included in our  proxy statement    After our 2017 Annual Meeting 
 The financial performance measures in the annual incentive plans should be weighted more than the non-financial performance measures    Changed the weighting so that the financial performance measures in the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan were 75% of the target award compared to 50% of the target award in the 2016 Annual Incentive  Plan    More objective measure of CEO and NEO performance in the annual incentive plan    Fiscal Year 2018 
[END TABLE]
At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted to continue to have an annual Say on Pay vote. In connection with our ongoing stockholder engagement effort, during fiscal year 2018 we contacted stockholders, who collectively held more than 70% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and offered to discuss and obtain feedback on our compensation programs, corporate governance and any other matters of interest. We ultimately had discussions with stockholders representing approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding common stock. These discussions were held with our Senior Vice President, Corporate Relations, our Senior Vice President, Human Resources, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and our Associate General Counsel and, in certain instances, by certain members of our Board. This effort supplemented the ongoing communications and meetings that we hold with our investors throughout the fiscal year and focused on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Our goal was to understand better the concerns of our stockholders with respect to executive compensation, corporate governance and other matters of interest and whether the changes that had been made addressed their concerns. Stockholders were generally pleased with the changes that had been made. The feedback we received was positive reinforcement that stockholders supported the Company's executive compensation program.

Compensation Philosophy 
We believe that the majority of our executive compensation should be dependent on the continued growth and success of our Company so that our NEOs are fully aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, a significant portion of executive compensation is designed to be "at risk", and therefore, except for base salary, a significant portion of our NEOs' total direct compensation is dependent on achieving quantitative performance goals and provides for a significant portion to be paid in the form of equity compensation that will appreciate in value only to the extent that shares held by our stockholders also increase in value. 
The Compensation Committee reviews our compensation design and philosophy on at least an annual basis to ensure that our executive compensation program continues to support the Company's strategy, objectives and stockholder interests. 
Executive Compensation Program Objectives 
We provide a competitive total compensation package to our executive management team through a combination of base salary, annual incentives, long-term incentives and other compensation, as well as severance and change in control agreements. 
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prioritize implementation of pay for performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Promote the creation of long-term stockholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, motivate and retain key employees with outstanding talent and ability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Structure executive compensation in a manner that promotes our strategic, financial and operating performance objectives;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reward performance, with a meaningful portion of compensation tied to the Company's financial, operational and  strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
Our compensation elements are designed to achieve the objectives set forth above as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary and benefits are designed to attract and retain executives by providing regular and continued payments that  are appropriate to their position, experience and responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual performance-based awards are designed to focus our executives on pre-set  objectives each year that are generally operational and drive specific performance needed to foster short-term and long-term growth and profitability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives are designed to align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders and to motivate  executives to generate value for our stockholders over the long-term; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance and change-in-control  arrangements are designed to mitigate the distraction of our key executives when faced with a potential change-in-control or other possible termination situations and to  facilitate our ability to attract and retain executives as we compete for talented individuals in a marketplace where such protections are commonly offered.

Discussion of our Fiscal Year 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
This section provides a discussion of the Compensation Committee's decisions regarding the compensation of our NEOs for fiscal year 2018. 
Peer Group 
Each year, the Compensation Committee evaluates the previously-selected peer group and determines which companies best reflect the Company's competitors for talent. A key objective of our executive compensation program is to ensure that total direct compensation is competitive with the companies against which we compete for talent. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee that was in place at the beginning of the fiscal year engaged Aon Hewitt as its independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in developing and evaluating the peer group. 
In order to examine the competitiveness of our overall compensation program, Aon Hewitt compared the total direct compensation of our NEOs (consisting of base salary, annual incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation as determined under SEC rules but not including benefits and perquisites) during fiscal year 2017 to the publicly filed data of comparable companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. 
The process for choosing the companies used in the compensation analysis provided by Aon Hewitt was based on the following screening criteria as instructed by the Compensation Committee: revenues, market capitalization, strong growth experience, significant international operations, focus on organic, natural and better-for-you food/beverage or consumer/household products, recognized for their industry leadership and brand recognition and viewed as competitors for executive talent. Our peer group for fiscal 2018 was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.       Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. 
   Coach, Inc.       Panera Bread Company

   Molson Coors Brewing Company       United Natural Foods, Inc. 
   Monster Beverage Corporation       The Estee Lauder Companies  Inc. 
[END TABLE]
At the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company changed the composition of the Board, resulting in the Compensation Committee being composed of all new Committee members. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged ClearBridge Compensation Group, LLC ("ClearBridge") as its new independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in developing and evaluating a new peer group and assisting the Compensation Committee with their roles and responsibilities. In developing a new peer group, ClearBridge utilized the following screening criteria as instructed by the Compensation Committee: enterprise value, revenue and companies in the food and personal care products industry. Our peer group for fiscal year 2019 is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   B&G Foods, Inc.       Lancaster Colony  Corporation 
   Darling Ingredients, Inc.       Pinnacle Foods Inc.1 
   Edgewell Personal Care Company       Post Holdings, Inc. 
   Flowers Foods, Inc.       Prestige Brands Holdings,  Inc. 
[END TABLE]

In addition to the identification of a new peer group, the Compensation Committee in conjunction with their advisor, ClearBridge, has undertaken a further detailed review of the Company's compensation plan design and other practices in order to identify areas to further enhance the compensation plans so that the Company's short and long-term compensation plans support the Compensation Committee's philosophy of pay for performance and full alignment with the creation of value for all stockholders. 
Compensation decisions regarding the plans that were established for our executive officers for fiscal year 2018 were made by the former Compensation Committee, with external market data from Aon Hewitt, as well as input from our Chief Executive Officer (except with respect to his own compensation). The Compensation Committee uses compensation data from the peer group as general guidance and as one of many factors that inform its judgment of appropriate compensation parameters for target compensation levels. When using peer group data, the Compensation Committee references the 50th percentile, recognizing that the specific positioning for each NEO is determined on a case-by-case basis considering multiple factors. 
Base Salary 
The base salaries of our NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis by our Compensation Committee and our Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to his own salary which is reviewed and determined by our Compensation Committee). This review is supplemented by market data, as well as assessments of the performance of our executive officers by our Compensation Committee. We pay base salaries to our NEOs to compensate them for their day-to-day services. The salaries typically are used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge, past performance and responsibilities of each NEO. 
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following salaries for the NEOs:

Annual Incentive Plan 
A key executive compensation objective is to have a majority of each NEO's compensation be tied to the Company's operational and financial performance. To this end, the annual incentive plan, which is fully at-risk, is based on performance against pre-set key financial and individual objectives designed to drive the specific performance needed to foster both short-term and long-term growth and profitability. 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors approved the Company's fiscal year 2018 operating plan, which included performance objectives that were used to design each NEO's annual incentive plan for fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee, in an effort to continue to motivate the Chief Executive Officer and the other NEOs to further grow and develop our business, set rigorous performance targets for fiscal year 2018 that it considered aggressive and attainable only with focused effort and strong execution by our NEOs. In addition to financial targets, the Compensation Committee also set individual performance targets. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee assigned a 75% weighting for financial targets and a 25% weighting for individual performance targets for each NEO. These weightings represented the Compensation Committee's general view of the relative importance of the performance targets with respect to each NEO at the time the performance targets were adopted. 
The financial performance targets were designed to drive significant increases in net sales growth and profitability, which the Compensation Committee believed would increase stockholder value consistent with our overall long-term plan. The adjusted net sales measure was designed to reflect our objectives of growing top-line revenue by introducing new products and expanding distribution in new and existing channels and geographies. The adjusted earnings per share measure was designed to serve as an indicator of the Company's profitability. To ensure that we efficiently develop and expand our markets, the adjusted EBITDA measure was intended to motivate Messrs. Simon and Langrock and Ms. Faltischek to manage our costs and take into account the appropriate level of expenses expected with our growth. The Compensation Committee considered the financial objectives to be significantly rigorous given that the target level of performance required the Company to achieve 5.5% net sales growth, 43% adjusted earnings per share growth and 35% adjusted EBITDA growth when compared to the previous year. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Incentive Award Determinations 
For fiscal year 2018, each of the NEOs, other than Ms. Meringolo, had the opportunity to earn the following annual incentive awards as a percentage of base salary for threshold, target and maximum performance:

162(m) Funding 
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee established the performance goal of adjusted EBITDA1 of $288 million, which must be met for a NEO's Annual Incentive Plan to be funded under Section 162(m) of the Code. As our fiscal year 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $271 million did not exceed the established goal, no awards were funded under the plan.

[END TABLE]
In connection with the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee determined that the adjusted EBITDA goal required to be met for 162(m) funding was not achieved. As a result, for purposes of compliance with the Section 162(m) funding requirement, the Compensation Committee determined that no awards would be paid in connection with the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make a final determination regarding the achievement of the pre-determined performance measures set forth above.

Long-Term Incentive Program 
We believe that equity grants serve our compensation objectives by linking the compensation of our key employees to our long-term strategic plan and further align such employees with our stockholders since the value of equity awards will increase or decrease with the changes in the value of our common stock. Grants are generally made under a performance-based long-term incentive program (the "LTI Program"). In fiscal year 2018, the LTI Program consisted of two performance-based long-term incentive plans (the "2016-2018 LTIP" and the "2017-2019 LTIP"). 
In response to our stockholder outreach efforts, the Company redesigned its LTI Program (commencing with the 2016-2018 LTIP) to provide performance-based awards only, which may be earned over a longer three-year performance period. In addition, the Compensation Committee adopted relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") and net sales as the performance measures for determining individual payouts. The relative TSR measure was adopted based upon the feedback we had received from stockholders and enables our stockholders to assess stockholder returns relative to our peers. The net sales measure was designed to reflect our long-term strategic plan of continually growing top-line net sales year over year. Given the importance our stockholders place on net sales growth, the Compensation Committee retained it as a performance measure. In addition, the Compensation Committee assigned a 50% weighting for the relative TSR measure and a 50% weighting for the net sales measure given that they did not view one measure to be more significant than the other. Participants in the LTI Program include our executive officers, including the NEOs, and certain other key employees. 
2016-2018 LTIP 
162(m) Funding Target 
For the three-year performance period of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee established the performance goal of achieving an average adjusted operating income4 of $355 million for such period, which must be met for a NEO's Long-Term Incentive Plan to be funded under Section 162(m) of the Code. As our three-year average adjusted operating income of $254 million did not exceed the established goal, no awards were funded under the plan. 
Award Levels, Performance Measures and Targets

In connection with the 2016-2018 LTIP, the Compensation Committee determined that the adjusted operating income goal required to be met for 162(m) funding was not achieved. As a result, for purposes of compliance with the Section 162(m) funding requirement, the Compensation Committee determined that no awards would be paid or vested pursuant to the 2016-2018 LTIP, and all performance stock unit awards previously granted in connection with relative TSR were forfeited. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make a final determination regarding the achievement of the pre-determined performance measures of relative TSR and net sales.
The following table shows the target awards and the awards as determined by the Compensation Committee and the percentage of the target payment represented by the award for each participating NEO:

5   Under the terms of the plan adopted by the Compensation Committee, operating income is adjusted for the impact of non-cash compensation, currency fluctuations, impairment of long-lived assets, restructuring, integration and acquisition charges and other non-recurring items which may have  been incurred during the performance period.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee makes its determination for each individual NEO award based on the achievement of the pre-determined performance measures of relative TSR and net sales. The relative TSR performance measure is discussed in more detail below. For the net sales performance measure, target performance was determined to be the average net sales over the three-year performance period, starting with the middle of the range of net sales for fiscal year 2017 and increasing net sales by 3% growth for fiscal year 2018 and 4% for fiscal year 2019. The threshold, target and maximum awards were set by the Compensation Committee working in consultation with the Compensation Committee's former consultant, Aon Hewitt. Such awards shall be paid in full value shares. As we have not completed the performance period, therefore, individual awards have not yet been determined under this plan. 
Equity Awards 
In connection with the relative TSR portion of the 2017-2019 LTIP, the NEOs each received a grant of performance-based restricted stock units in connection with the 50% of his or her award tied to relative TSR. Each performance-based restricted stock unit represents a right to receive one share of common stock of the Company on the settlement date of the award provided that the Company has achieved the requisite performance. The performance is based upon the Company's relative TSR in terms of percentile ranking as compared to the S&P Food & Beverage Select Industry peer group over the performance period beginning on July 1, 2016 and ending on June 30, 2019 in accordance with the schedule below:

Other Compensation and Perquisites 
Our NEOs are eligible for the same level and offering of benefits that we make available to other employees, including our 401(k) plan, health care, dental and vision plans, life insurance plans and other employee benefit programs. In addition to the standard benefits offered to other employees, we reimburse Mr. Simon for expenses for health, prescription, dental and vision not covered by our insurance plan that are incurred by him and his dependents. In addition, in accordance with his employment agreement, we reimburse Mr. Simon for a portion of the premium associated with his life insurance policy and provide long-term disability coverage for the benefit of Mr. Simon and long-term care coverage for the benefit of Mr. Simon and his spouse. We do not have any defined benefit pension plans or executive supplemental retirement programs. 
In fiscal year 2018, we continued to provide either an automobile perquisite or a car allowance for each of the NEOs. We believe the costs of these benefits constitute only a small portion of each NEO's total compensation and are consistent with benefits offered by companies with whom we compete for talent for purposes of recruitment and retention. For additional information regarding other compensation and perquisites, see "Executive Compensation Tables-Summary Compensation Table." 
Impact of Tax Treatment 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to each of our most highly paid executive officers (other than the chief financial officer). Although the Compensation Committee considers whether or not a compensation program would be subject to the Section 162(m) limit, in order to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote corporate goals, the Committee has not adopted a policy that all compensation must be tax deductible. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended by the 2017 Tax Reform Law, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the 2017 Tax Reform Law eliminates the 162(m) exception for performance-based compensation (other than with respect to payments made pursuant to certain "grandfathered" arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017) and expands the definition of "covered employee" to include a company's chief financial officer and certain individuals who were covered employees in years other than the then-current taxable year. In light of the changes to Section 162(m), the Committee anticipates that a larger portion of future compensation paid to our named executive officers will be subject to a tax deduction disallowance under Section 162(m). 
Succession Agreement 
On June 24, 2018, the Company and Irwin D. Simon entered into a Succession Agreement (the "Succession Agreement"), pursuant to which the parties agreed that, on the date immediately prior to the first date of employment of a new Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "Succession Date"), Mr. Simon will resign from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from all other offices with the Company and its affiliates. 
Prior to the Succession Date, Mr. Simon's employment with the Company will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Mr. Simon's employment agreement dated as of July 1, 2003, as amended through September 23, 2014, by any among Mr. Simon and the Company (as amended, the "Employment Agreement"). During such period, Mr. Simon will be entitled to receive his base salary but will not be eligible to receive an annual bonus in respect of the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 or be granted any additional long-term incentive awards. 
On the Succession Date, Mr. Simon will be entitled to the following payments and benefits: (A) a cash separation payment equal to $34,294,688.00, payable in a single lump sum, (B) continuation of the certain life insurance and disability insurance related benefits provided under the Employment Agreement until the third anniversary of the Succession Date, and (C) continuation of certain health benefits provided in the Employment Agreement. 
Upon the Succession Date, the long-term incentive awards set forth in Exhibit B of the Succession Agreement (the "LTI Awards") shall be treated as follows: (i) all LTI Awards shall be deemed vested with respect to any service-based requirements to which such awards are then subject, and (ii) with respect to all LTI Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting requirements, such awards shall remain subject to the applicable performance-based vesting requirements under the respective award agreements. 
Upon the Succession Date, Mr. Simon will be entitled to (A) the earned but unpaid base salary and accrued but unused vacation days, payable in a single lump sum following the Succession Date, in accordance with the Employment Agreement, (B) any amounts which are vested or which Mr. Simon is otherwise entitled to receive at or subsequent to the Succession Date without regard to the performance by Mr. Simon of further services, and (C) settlement of any unreimbursed business expenses 
In connection with resigning from his position as President, Chief Executive Officer and Non-Executive Chairman as of the Succession Date, Mr. Simon has decided not to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors. Accordingly, following the Annual Meeting, Mr. Simon will no longer serve on the Board of Directors. 
On October 26, 2018, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Simon in order to, among other things, assist Mr. Schiller with a smooth transition into his role as the Company's new Chief Executive Officer, and to assist with the previously announced disposition of the Hain Pure Protein Corporation, including each of the Empire Kosher, Plainville Farms, and FreeBird businesses. The term of the Consulting Agreement will commence on November 5, 2018 and will continue until the earliest of (i) three months from the commencement date, (ii) Mr. Simon's voluntary termination of the Consulting Agreement and (iii) the termination of the Consulting Agreement for Cause (as defined in the Consulting Agreement) (the "Consulting Term"). Mr. Simon will receive aggregate consulting fees of $975,000 as compensation for his services during the Consulting Term (the "Consulting Fee"). In the event of Mr. Simon's voluntary termination of the Consulting Agreement or the termination of the Consulting Agreement for Cause, (each, a "Forfeiture Event"), Mr. Simon will not be entitled to any portion of the consulting fees for any period following the Forfeiture Event. 
In addition to the Consulting Fee, the Company has agreed to reimburse Mr. Simon for (i) all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that he incurs at the request of the Company in connection with providing the services under the Consulting Agreement, and (ii) Mr. Simon's reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with the negotiation of the Consulting Agreement, not to exceed $50,000. The Company has also agreed to provide Mr. Simon with an administrative assistant through the first anniversary of the expiration of the Consulting Term. Except as described above, no further payments will be made to Mr. Simon under the consulting agreement and Mr. Simon has agreed to waive, forfeit and release any and all rights to or interest in certain long-term incentive awards set forth in the Succession Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Simon and the Company agreed to execute a mutual general release of claims. 
Severance and Change-in-Control Agreements 
The Compensation Committee believes that severance and change-in-control benefits are important for attracting and retaining executive talent and help to ensure that NEOs can remain focused during periods of uncertainty and neutralize the potential conflict of our key executives when faced with a potential change-in-control. 
We have entered into change of control agreements with each of the NEOs which provide for severance in the event of a change of control as defined in their respective change of control agreement or employment agreement. In addition, certain of the NEOs will receive severance in the event his or her employment is terminated without cause. The restricted stock agreements entered into with our NEOs provide for the immediate vesting of such stock grants upon a change in control. For a complete description of these severance and change in control agreements, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control" below. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee believes that requiring NEOs and other key employees to hold significant amounts of our common stock strengthens their alignment with the interests of our stockholders and promotes achievement of long-term business objectives. To this end, the Compensation Committee has adopted stock ownership guidelines that require key members of the Company's management team to own minimum amounts of the Company's common stock. The guidelines for senior management are set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Officer Level       Ownership  Target   
    Officer Level       Ownership  Target   
   Chief Executive Officer            6 times annual base salary      
   Chief Executive Officer            6 times annual base salary      
   Executive Vice Presidents            3 times annual base salary      
   Executive Vice Presidents            3 times annual base salary      
   Other Executive Officers and Segment Leaders            2 times annual base salary      
   Other Executive Officers and Segment Leaders            2 times annual base salary      
   All other LTIP  participants            1 times annual base  salary      
   All other LTIP  participants            1 times annual base  salary      
[END TABLE]
Members of management subject to the guidelines have until five years after appointment to achieve the ownership target. The dollar value of shares which must be acquired and held equals a multiple of the individual executive's base salary. Stockholding requirements are updated whenever a change in base salary occurs. Shares purchased on the open market, shares acquired and held upon stock option exercise, unvested time-based restricted shares and unvested time-based restricted share units all count toward the ownership target. Failure by an employee subject to these guidelines to meet or to show sustained progress toward meeting the Ownership Target may result in a payout of annual cash incentive awards or long-term incentive awards (in the case of employees) in stock. 
Compensation Recoupment Policy 
We have adopted a clawback provision in connection with equity awards. The clawback provision provides that, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct an accounting error included in a report on Form 10-Q or 10-K caused by the misconduct of an employee, the employee shall return to the Company, or forfeit if not paid, any award arising out of the misconduct for or during such restated period. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the materials under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" included in the Company's proxy statement with the management of the Company. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that such Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's proxy statement and be incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018.

(1)  The amounts shown as Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan  Awards reflect the threshold, target and maximum amounts that may be earned by each individual during fiscal year 2018 under the Annual Incentive Plan. For more information, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Annual Incentive Plan,"  beginning on page 23.  
(2)  The amounts reflected in Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards columns reflect the threshold,  target and maximum amounts that could be paid to each NEO under the 2017-2019 LTIP. The Compensation Committee has  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     the discretion to adjust these amounts based upon its determination at the end of the 2017-2019 LTIP performance period. As described in the "Long-Term Incentive Program" section above,  on September 26, 2017 the NEOs received equity grants (the "LTIP Awards"), the value of which was 50% of each NEO's target under the 2017-2019 LTIP. Accordingly, at the end of the three-year performance period,  if the Compensation Committee determines that the amounts reflected in the Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards columns should be awarded, any such awards will be paid net of the "50% of LTIP Target Dollars" as shown  in the table on page 33.  
(3)  The amounts granted were determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and reflect the grant date fair value of the  shares of restricted stock issued on April 2, 2018. The shares granted to Ms. Meringolo vest in three equal installments on April 2, 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
We believe that severance and change-in-control benefits are important for attracting and retaining executive talent and help to ensure that executive officers can remain focused during periods of uncertainty and neutralize the potential conflict of our key executives when faced with a potential change-in-control. These considerations are particularly important in an environment where merger and acquisition activity is high. 
Irwin D. Simon 
On June 24, 2018, the Company and Irwin D. Simon entered into the Succession Agreement, which provides that on the Succession Date, Mr. Simon will resign from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from all other offices with the Company and its affiliates. Prior to the Succession Date, Mr. Simon's employment with the Company will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Mr. Simon's employment agreement dated as of July 1, 2003, as amended through September 23, 2014, by any among Mr. Simon and the Company (as amended, the "Employment Agreement"). 
Had the Succession Date been June 30, 2018 and Mr. Simon resigned from the Company at that time, consistent with the Succession Agreement, Mr. Simon would have been entitled to the following payments and benefits: (A) a cash separation payment equal to $34,294,688.00, payable in a single lump sum, (B) continuation of the certain life insurance and disability insurance related benefits provided under the Employment Agreement until the third anniversary of the Succession Date, and (C) continuation of certain health benefits provided in the Employment Agreement. In addition, he will be entitled to (A) the earned but unpaid base salary and accrued but unused vacation days, payable in a single lump sum following the Succession Date, in accordance with the Employment Agreement, (B) any amounts which are vested or which Mr. Simon is otherwise entitled to receive at or subsequent to the Succession Date without regard to the performance by Mr. Simon of further services, and (C) settlement of any unreimbursed business expenses. 
In addition to the payments and benefits set forth above, upon the Succession Date, the long-term incentive awards set forth in Exhibit B of the Succession Agreement (the "LTI Awards") would have been treated as follows: (i) all LTI Awards would have been deemed vested with respect to any service-based requirements to which such awards are then subject, and (ii) with respect to all LTI Awards that are subject to performance-based vesting requirements, such awards would have been subject to the applicable performance-based vesting requirements under the respective award agreements. The LTI Awards would have otherwise remain subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements. As of the date of this proxy statement, Mr. Simon holds (a) 88,213 shares of time-vested restricted stock that will vest as of the Succession Date, which have a value of $2,628,747 based on the closing stock price of the Company's common stock on June 29, 2018, and (b) performance share units with respect to a target number of 164,265 shares, which will remain eligible to vest after the end of the performance period subject to the achievement of applicable performance targets as described above under the heading "2017-2019 LTIP," and the potential value of which is described in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End" table on page 39. 
In the event that, Mr. Simon's employment had been terminated on account of death, Disability, Termination Without Cause, or Termination for Good Reason on June 30, 2018, prior to the Succession Date, Mr. Simon would have been entitled to receive the payments and benefits set forth above, and the date of such termination would have been treated as the Succession Date. 
If Mr. Simon's employment had ended on June 30, 2018 as a result of a Termination For Cause or a Termination Not for Good Reason prior to the Succession Date, Mr. Simon would have been entitled to: (A) the earned but unpaid base salary and accrued but unused vacation days, payable in accordance with the Employment Agreement, (B) any amounts which vested or which Mr. Simon is otherwise entitled to receive at or subsequent to the Succession Date without regard to the performance by Mr. Simon of further services or the resolution of a contingency, and (C) settlement of any unreimbursed business expenses. 
Pursuant to Mr. Simon's employment agreement: (i) a Termination Without Cause means any termination of Mr. Simon's employment other than a Termination For Cause or Termination Due to Disability; and (ii) a Termination for Good Reason means (a) a termination of his employment by Mr. Simon following a diminution of his position, duties and responsibilities, the removal of Mr. Simon from, or failure to re-elect Mr. Simon as, the Chairman of the Board or as CEO, a reduction in his base salary or (b) following a change-in-control, Mr. Simon not being Chairman of the Board or CEO of any ultimate parent company resulting from the change-in-control or any material reduction in compensation opportunity (including achievability) or benefits provided under any compensation, incentive, employee benefit or welfare plan or program of the Company or any subsidiary in which Mr. Simon participated before the change in control. 
A change-in-control is defined generally as one of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The acquisition by a person of beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding stock  of the Company; however if any one person or group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the capital stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons acting  as a group is not considered to cause a change-in-control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of our Board of Directors is replaced during any 12-month period by  directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or election;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consummation of a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization of the Company or a subsidiary, reverse  split of any class of voting stock, or an acquisition of securities or assets by the Company or a subsidiary, unless our stockholders prior to such event beneficially own more than 60% of the voting stock of the surviving or transferee entity in  substantially the same proportions as their prior ownership; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consummation of a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets.   
[END TABLE]
Other NEOs 
Each of Messrs. Langrock and Tickle and Mses. Faltischek and Meringolo have a change-in-control agreement in place which provides for severance only if he or she was terminated without cause or experiences a diminution in duties or forced relocation, in each case, following a change-in-control. For Messrs. Tickle and Langrock, severance is equal to two times his annual base salary and two times the average bonus paid to him during the thirty-six month period prior to the change-in-control and up to two years of benefits continuation. For Ms. Faltischek, severance is equal to three times her annual base salary and three times the average annual bonus paid to her during the thirty-six month period prior to the change-in-control and up to three years of benefits continuation. For Ms. Meringolo, severance is equal to one times her annual base salary and one times the average annual bonus paid to her during the thirty-six month period prior to the change-in-control and up to one year of benefits continuation. In addition to the change in control agreements, our restricted stock agreements and performance unit agreements (including those with Messrs. Langrock and Tickle and Mses. Faltischek and Meringolo) provide for immediate vesting of such stock grants upon a change-in-control.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During fiscal year 2018, the members of the Compensation Committee were Jack Sinclair, Glenn W. Welling and Lawrence S. Zilavy. None of the Compensation Committee members during fiscal year 2018 had any relationship required to be disclosed under this caption pursuant to the rules of the SEC. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our CEO and the annual total compensation of our employees for fiscal year 2018 (our "CEO pay ratio"). Our CEO pay ratio information is a reasonable good faith estimate calculated in a manner consistent with applicable SEC rules. As of June 30, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 7,585 individuals working at our parent company and consolidated subsidiaries, which includes all employees whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis. We selected June 30, 2018 as the determination date for identifying the median employee. We determined the median employee by using a consistently applied compensation measure of total annual taxable compensation paid to our global employee population other than our CEO. We define "total taxable compensation" as gross compensation for the period from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, which given the geographical distribution of our employee population includes a variety of pay elements based on local tax regulations. Consistent with our compensation philosophy all global employees are compensated based upon their local market as reviewed on an annual basis, and we believe that "total annual taxable compensation" provides a reasonable estimate of annual compensation for our employees. For purposes of calculating the pay ratio, the total annual taxable compensation was converted to U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of June 30, 2018. Although permitted under SEC regulations, we did not annualize compensation of employees who were not employed with us for the full fiscal year, and therefore the total annual taxable compensation of many employees was lower than it would have been had the compensation been annualized. In determining our median compensated employee and calculating the CEO pay ratio we did not use any of the exemptions permitted under SEC rules nor did we rely upon any material assumptions adjustments or estimates. Using this methodology we determined that the median employee was a non-exempt full-time employee located in the U.S. with an annual total compensation of $29,790 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Our CEO's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 calculated in the same manner was $7,463,170. Based on this information for fiscal year 2018, the ratio of the compensation of the CEO to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 251 to 1. 
PROPOSAL NO. 2 ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Background 
We believe that both the Company and its stockholders benefit from responsive compensation and corporate governance policies. Recognizing the interest our stockholders expressed in an advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs, since 2009 the Company has provided its stockholders an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. Since 2011, Section 14A of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), has required us to provide our stockholders with a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs ("Say on Pay Proposal") as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
We are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our NEOs, as described in the "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis" ("CD&A") section of this proxy statement. Although the advisory vote is not binding upon the Company, the Company's Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values our stockholders' opinions and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote in its ongoing evaluation of our executive compensation program. 
Our executive compensation philosophy and practice reflects our unwavering commitment to paying for performance – both short- and long-term. We believe that our multi-faceted executive compensation plans, with their integrated focus on both individual and corporate goals and objectives, as well as short- and long-term metrics, provide an effective framework by which progress against our strategic goals may be appropriately measured and rewarded. 
Stockholder Outreach 
Last year, our stockholders approved our Say on Pay resolution with 70.3% of the votes cast voting in favor, which represented a significant improvement over the 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders where only 41% of the votes cast supported our Say on Pay resolution. We believe that the improvement in last year's Say on Pay resolution resulted from the significant compensation and governance actions the Company took in response to its extensive stockholder outreach efforts after the 2015 Annual Meeting. 
Conclusion 
We urge stockholders to read the CD&A beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative, appearing on pages 37 through 40, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the CD&A are effective in achieving our goals. 
For the reasons stated above, the Board of Directors recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the following Say on Pay Proposal: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved. 
Because your vote is advisory, it is not binding on the Company or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee values the opinions that our stockholders express in their votes. The Compensation Committee will review the results of the annual stockholder votes on the Say on Pay Proposal and consider whether to recommend any changes or modifications to the Company's executive compensation policies and practices as a result of such votes.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 
It is the practice of the Board of Directors to designate an accounting firm to serve as our registered independent accountants. The Audit Committee has recommended that Ernst & Young LLP be selected to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and the Board of Directors has approved the selection of Ernst & Young LLP. Ernst & Young LLP has audited our financial statements since 1994. 
The Audit Committee reviews and approves the audit and non-audit services to be provided by our registered independent accountants during the year, considers the effect that performing non-audit services might have on audit independence and approves management's engagement of our registered independent accountants to perform those services. 
If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee may, but is not required to, reconsider whether to retain Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different registered independent accountant at any time during the year if it is determined that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. 
Ernst & Young LLP expects to have a representative at our Annual Meeting who will have the opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to questions, as appropriate.

 such services are consistent with the registered independent accountants' independence, whether the registered independent accountants are likely to provide the most effective and efficient service based on their familiarity with us, and whether the service could enhance our ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. The Audit Committee has delegated limited pre-approval authority to its chairperson, who must report any decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, all of the audit fees, audit related fees, tax fees and all other fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its chairperson. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in overseeing the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company's internal audit function and the performance of the Company's internal controls and procedures. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews all material related party transactions, if any, for potential conflicts of interest and all such transactions must be approved by the Audit Committee. 
In addition to fulfilling its responsibilities as set forth in its charter and further described above in "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance – Committees of the Board – The Audit Committee," the Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018. Discussions about the Company's audited financial statements included its independent registered public accounting firm's judgments about the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and underlying estimates used in its financial statements, as well as other matters, as required by the applicable auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and by our Audit Committee Charter. In conjunction with the specific activities performed by the Audit Committee in its oversight role, it issued the following report:

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file initial reports of beneficial ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are also required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations from our executive officers and directors, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, except that Mr. Simon inadvertently filed one late Form 4 reporting three transactions.

Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
We have adopted a written policy regarding the review, approval and ratification of related party transactions. The Related Party Transaction Policy and Procedures requires the approval or ratification by the Audit Committee of any "related party transaction," which is defined as any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which (i) we are a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees, 5% stockholders (or their immediate family members) or any entity with which any of the foregoing persons is an employee, general partner, principal or 5% stockholder, each of whom we refer to as a "related person," has a direct or indirect interest as set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K. The policy provides that management must present to the Audit Committee for review and approval each proposed related party transaction (other than related party transactions involving compensation matters and certain ordinary course transactions). The Audit Committee must review the relevant facts and circumstances of the transaction, including if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms-length dealings with an unrelated third party and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction, take into account the conflicts of interest and corporate opportunity provisions of our Code of Conduct, and either approve or disapprove the related party transaction. If advance approval of a related party transaction requiring the Audit Committee's approval is not feasible, the transaction may be preliminarily entered into by management upon prior approval of the transaction by the chair of the Audit Committee, subject to ratification of the transaction by the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee will also review those transactions that would have been deemed a "related party transaction" but for the fact that the amount involved is $120,000 or less. No director may participate in approval of a related party transaction for which he or she is a related party. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Company's management is not aware of any other matters that will come before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters requiring a vote of stockholders arise, including any question as to an adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named on the enclosed proxy card to vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS 
Stockholder proposals intended to be included in the Proxy Statement relating to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2019 Proxy Statement") pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act ("Rule 14a-8") must be in writing addressed to the Corporate Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, no later than July 1, 2019, and must otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8. 
For stockholder nominations and other proposals that are not intended to be included in the 2019 Proxy Statement, they must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary prior to the close of business on September 14, 2019. 
In addition, if you would like to have their nominee included in our proxy materials for future annual meetings, notice of stockholder nominations intended to be included in the 2018 Proxy Statement must be received by the Corporate Secretary between June 1, 2019 and July 1, 2019. Stockholders should consult our By-Laws for the various procedural, informational and other requirements applicable to such nominations. 
A stockholder or other interested party who wishes to communicate with the Board, the non-management directors as a group, or any individual director may do so by addressing the correspondence to the individual or group, c/o Corporate Secretary, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042. All correspondence addressed to a director will be forwarded to that director. 
Householding 
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, multiple stockholders who share the same last name and address will receive only one copy of the annual proxy materials, unless they notify us that they wish to continue receiving multiple copies. We have undertaken householding to reduce our printing costs and postage fees. 
If you wish to opt-out of householding and receive multiple copies of the proxy materials at the same address, you may do so at any time prior to thirty days before the mailing of proxy materials, which typically are mailed in October of each year, by notifying us in writing at: 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
You also may request additional copies of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 by notifying us in writing at the same address or calling Investor Relations at (877) 612-4246 or submitting such request via e-mail to investorrelations@hain.com. 
If you share an address with another stockholder and currently are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials, you may request householding by notifying us at the above-referenced address. 
Investors may obtain copies of Hain Celestial's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K at no charge by contacting Investor Relations, The Hain Celestial Group, Inc., 1111 Marcus Avenue, Lake Success, NY 11042.
