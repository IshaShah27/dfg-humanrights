PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Board and Management Transition Plan
​
On March 19, 2019, we announced that Donald A. Miller CFA, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, will retire as our Chief Executive Officer, effective June 30, 2019. Mr. Smith, who currently serves as our President and Chief Investment Officer, will succeed Mr. Miller as our Chief Executive Officer, effective July 1, 2019. As a result of Mr. Smith's promotion to President and his expected transition to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Smith's regional responsibilities have been transitioned to Mr. Wiberg. See "Certain Information About Management" below.
In connection with the announced leadership transition, upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our board of directors increased the size of our board to nine members and elected Mr. Smith to our board of directors. Each of Mr. Miller and Mr. Smith is a nominee for re-election at the Annual Meeting. If elected, Mr. Miller will serve on our board of directors until our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, or until his successor is duly elected, but will not stand for re-election at our 2020 annual meeting.
Our current nine member board of directors is comprised of seven independent and two non-independent members. 
At the Annual Meeting, you will vote on the election of nine directors. Each nominee elected will serve as a director until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her death, resignation or removal from office. Each of the following nominees, with the exception of Mr. Smith who was appointed to the board on March 19, 2019, has served as a director since our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Each nominee has been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting by our board of directors in accordance with our established nomination procedures discussed in this proxy statement.
​
Your board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" all nine nominees listed for election as directors.

PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL 2019
Engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP
​
On March 19, 2019, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. This proposal asks you to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although we are not required to obtain such ratification from our stockholders, the board of directors believes it is good practice to do so. Notwithstanding the ratification, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that the change would be in the best interests of Piedmont and our stockholders. In the event that the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm, but will not be required to appoint a different firm. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2018. 
A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by stockholders. 
​
​
Your board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.
​
Pre-Approval Policies
​
The Audit Committee must pre-approve all auditing services performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, as well as all permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof), in order to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair the registered public accounting firm's independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm has received "general" pre-approval, it will require "specific" pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
All requests or applications for services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that do not require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to management and must include a detailed description of the services to be rendered. Management will determine whether such services are included within the list of services that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Requests or applications to provide services that require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both our independent registered public accounting firm and our chief financial officer, treasurer, or chief accounting officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on registered public accounting firm independence. The chairman of the Audit Committee has been delegated the authority to specifically pre-approve all services not covered by the general pre-approval guidelines, up to an amount not to exceed $75,000 per occurrence. Amounts requiring pre-approval in excess of $75,000 per occurrence require specific pre-approval by our Audit Committee prior to engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP, our current independent registered public accounting firm. All amounts specifically pre-approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee in accordance with this policy must be disclosed to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

Changes in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
​
On January 10, 2018, we notified Ernst & Young LLP of its dismissal as our independent registered public accounting firm, effective as of February 21, 2018. Our dismissal of Ernst & Young LLP was recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by our board of directors. 
Ernst & Young LLP's audit report for our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 
During our fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and through February 21, 2018, there were no disagreements (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Regulation S-K")) with Ernst & Young LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young LLP, would have caused Ernst & Young LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on our financial statements for such period, and, except with respect to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, there were no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
As previously disclosed in our amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, in conjunction with the preparation of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2017, our management became aware of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of ASC 350-20-40-2, specifically, the allocation of a portion of goodwill associated with our purchase of two property management companies to the carrying amount of assets sold or held for sale that met the definition of a "business" when determining the gain or loss on sale to be recognized for sold assets or the amount, if any, of impairment losses to be recognized for assets held for sale. The material weakness resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the two years ended December 31, 2016. Upon learning of this material weakness, our management took immediate remedial action. Our management initiated controls over the proper application of GAAP in accounting for goodwill related to the disposal of assets and in allocating goodwill to held for sale assets to determine the amount, if any, for impairment charges. Our management also strengthened our controls around the application of ASC 350-20-40-2 and the adoption of any new accounting standards by preparing formal written memos for every new standard that is applicable to us as opposed to the more material ones as we had historically done. Our management believes that it has fully remediated this material weakness. 
The Audit Committee has discussed the subject matter of the foregoing material weakness with Ernst & Young LLP, and we have authorized Ernst & Young LLP to respond fully to any inquiries concerning such matters made by Deloitte & Touche LLP . 
We have provided Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte & Touche LLP with a copy of the disclosure made above prior to the time this proxy statement was filed with the SEC and requested that each furnish us with a statement if it believes this disclosure to be incorrect or incomplete. Neither firm has provided us with such a statement.

Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms
​
The Audit Committee reviewed the audit and non-audit services performed by Piedmont's independent registered public accounting firms for fiscal 2018 and 2017, as well as the fees charged for such services. In its review of any non-audit service fees, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of such services was compatible with maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firms. The aggregate fees billed to us for professional accounting services, including the audits of our annual financial statements, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​ ​  2018   ​ ​  2017   ​ 
​  Total   ​ ​ ​ $ 1,102,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 1,161,000 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the preceding table, the professional fees are classified as follows: 
➢
Audit Fees — These are fees for professional services performed for the audit of our annual financial statements and the required review of quarterly financial statements and other procedures (including reviews of the purchase price allocation of acquisitions and dispositions) to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to be able to form an opinion on our consolidated financial statements. These fees also cover services that are normally provided by independent registered public accounting firms in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements, and services that 
​
generally only the independent registered public accounting firm reasonably can provide, such as services associated with filing registration statements, periodic reports, and other filings with the SEC. 
➢
Audit-Related Fees — These are fees for assurance and related services that traditionally are performed by independent registered public accounting firms, such as due diligence related to acquisitions and dispositions, attestation services that are not required by statute or regulation, internal control reviews, non recurring agreed-upon procedures and other professional fees associated with transactional activity. 
​
➢
Tax Fees — These are fees for all professional services performed by professional staff in our independent registered public accounting firm's tax division, except those services related to the audit of our financial statements. These include fees for tax compliance filings, tax planning, and tax advice, including federal, state, and local issues. Services may also include assistance with tax notices, audits and appeals before the Internal Revenue Service and similar state and local agencies. 
​
➢
All Other Fees — These are fees for other permissible work performed that do not meet the above-described categories, including assistance with internal audit plans and risk assessments. 
​
For the year ended December 31, 2018, all services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the policies and procedures described above.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Pay that reflects performance and alignment of pay with the long-term interests of our stockholders are key principles that underlie our compensation program. In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), stockholders have the opportunity to vote, on an advisory basis, on the compensation of our named executive officers. This is often referred to as a "say on pay" and provides you, as a stockholder, with the ability to cast a vote with respect to our 2018 executive compensation programs and policies and the compensation paid to the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement through the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and in the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosure in this proxy statement." 
As discussed in "Executive Compensation —  Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below, the compensation paid to our named executive officers is designed to meet the following objectives: 
➢
to attract and retain candidates capable of performing at the highest levels of our industry; 
​
➢
to create and maintain a performance-focused culture, by rewarding outstanding company and individual performance based upon objective predetermined metrics; 
​
➢
to reflect the qualifications, skills, experience and responsibilities of each named executive officer; 
​
➢
to link incentive compensation levels with the creation of stockholder value; 
​
➢
to align the interests of our executives and stockholders by creating opportunities and incentives for executives to increase their equity ownership in us; and 
​
➢
to motivate our executives to manage our business to meet and appropriately balance our short- and long-term objectives. 
​
This proposal is an advisory proposal, which means it is non-binding. Although the vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and consider the outcome in making decisions about future compensation arrangements for our named executive officers. 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, this vote does not overrule any decisions by the board of directors, will not create or imply any change to or any additional fiduciary duties of the board of directors and will not restrict or limit the ability of stockholders generally to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation.
​
​
Your board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers.

Currently, the board of directors has determined to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO, and Mr. McDowell currently serves as Chairman of the Board. The Chairman is elected by the board of directors on an annual basis and presides at regularly scheduled executive sessions of the independent directors. The board currently has no formal policy with respect to the separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; however, the board believes that the separation of the positions is in our best interests as it provides leadership for the independent board and the benefit of additional support, experience and oversight for the management team.
​
Board Committees
​
Our board of directors has established four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the Capital Committee. Each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee complies with the listing requirements and other rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE, each as amended or modified from time to time and has adopted a written charter. You can access each of our committee charters on the Investor relations pages of our website at www.piedmontreit.com. The board of directors has also determined that each of the current members of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees is independent within the meaning the NYSE's director independence standards applicable to members of such committees. Additionally, our Audit Committee members satisfy the enhanced independence standards set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act and NYSE listing standards, and our Compensation Committee members satisfy the enhanced independence standards set forth in NYSE listing standards and Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Each member of the 2018 board of directors attended in excess of 75% of the board and committee meetings on which such director served during 2018. Mr. Smith was appointed to the board of directors during 2019. 
We do not have a formal policy with regard to board member attendance at our annual stockholder meetings. All of the 2018 members of our board of directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders either telephonically or in person. 
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the board of directors in the oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the system of internal controls which our management has established, risk assessment, the performance of our internal audit function, and oversight of our technology platform, including cyber risk assessment and management. The Audit Committee is also directly responsible for the appointment, independence, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets alone with our senior management, our internal audit personnel, and with our independent registered public accounting firm, which has free access to the Audit Committee. 
The Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee assists the board of directors in setting the overall compensation strategy and compensation policies for our executive officers and directors, overseeing the assessment of risk associated with the Company's compensation policies and practices, reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and evaluating the Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of those goals and objectives. In addition the Compensation Committee determines our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, reviews and approves the compensation of other named executive officers and non-employee directors and administers our Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to serve on the board of directors consistent with criteria approved by the board of directors, recommending a slate of director nominees for election by our stockholders at the annual meeting of our stockholders, evaluating the independence of candidates for the board of directors, developing and implementing the process necessary to identify prospective members of our board of directors, determining the advisability of retaining any search firm or consultant to assist in the identification and evaluation of candidates for membership on the board of directors, overseeing an annual evaluation of the board of directors, and each of the committees of the board and management, developing and recommending to our board of directors a set of corporate governance principles and policies, and periodically reviewing our corporate governance structures and procedures and suggesting improvements thereto to our board of directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for reviewing stockholder communications and responding to inquiries concerning our governance practices, business ethics and corporate conduct, as well as reviewing and promoting the continuing education of our directors.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
The Capital Committee
The Capital Committee assists the board of directors by reviewing and advising the board of directors on our overall financial performance, including issues related to capital structure, operating earnings, dividends and budgetary and reporting processes, and reviewing and advising the board of directors on investment criteria and acquisition and disposition policies, general economic environment in various real estate markets, existing or prospective properties or tenants, and portfolio diversification goals.
​
Selection of Directors
​
The board of directors is responsible for selecting its own nominees and recommending them for election by the stockholders. The board delegates the screening process necessary to identify qualified candidates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews director suitability and the continuing composition of the board of directors and recommends director nominees who are voted on by the full board of directors. All director nominees then stand for election by the stockholders annually. 
In recommending director nominees to the board of directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee solicits candidate recommendations from its own members, other directors, and members of our management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may engage the services of a search firm to assist in identifying potential director nominees and will also consider recommendations for director candidates made by stockholders and other interested persons. Candidates for director must meet the established director criteria set forth above. In addition, under our Bylaws, stockholders may directly nominate candidates for election as directors. In order for a stockholder to make a nomination, the stockholder must satisfy the procedural requirements for such nomination as provided in Article II, Section 12 of our Bylaws. Any stockholder may request a copy of our Bylaws free of charge by writing to our Secretary at our corporate address. 
In evaluating candidates for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider each candidate without regard to the source of the recommendation and take into account those factors that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines are relevant, including the factors set forth below under "Board Membership Criteria".
​
Board Membership Criteria
​
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually reviews with the board of directors the appropriate experience, skills and characteristics required of directors, both in the context of the current membership of the board as well as in the context of potential turnover of the existing board. The table below summarizes the key characteristics that are considered and which of our current independent board members the Board particularly relies on with regard to each characteristic.

[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
The board considers all of these characteristics when assessing candidates for board membership. Other considerations included in both the annual assessment of existing members and the assessment of new candidates include the candidate or incumbent's status as an independent director, the ability of the candidate or incumbent to attend board meetings regularly and to devote an appropriate amount of effort in preparation for those meetings, and whether the candidate's knowledge and experience of a particular aspect of the real estate industry or particular skill set is additive to the existing experience or skill sets of incumbent members of the board. While we have not adopted a formal policy regarding diversity of our board, the board believes that a diverse membership having a variety of skills, styles, experiences and competencies is an important aspect of a well-functioning board. Accordingly, the Board believes that diversity, inclusive of gender and race, should be a central component in board searches, succession planning and recruiting. The board is committed to considering board slates that are as diverse as possible and that this is consistent with nominating only the most qualified candidates for the board who bring the required skills, competencies and fit to the Boardroom. 
Although a number of our directors are retired, it is also expected that independent directors nominated by the board of directors shall be individuals who possess a reputation and hold positions or affiliations befitting a director of a large publicly held company and are active in their occupation, profession, or community.
​
Board Self-Evaluation Process
​
Annually, the board of directors undertakes a robust self-evaluation process which is administered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the assistance of outside counsel. Members of the Board complete a detailed, confidential questionnaire which provides for ratings in key areas and also seeks subjective comments. Outside counsel collects and analyzes the data and reports the results and information compiled from the questionnaires to the Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee. Comments pertaining to particular Board Committees are shared with each respective Committee chairperson, and comments regarding the full Board are shared with the full Board. Matters requiring follow up are addressed by the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Chairman of the Board, or Chairman of the applicable Board Committee, as appropriate.
​
Majority Voting Policy
​
Our By-laws provide for majority voting for the election of directors in uncontested elections. Therefore, each director nominee will be elected if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted FOR a director must exceed the number of shares voted AGAINST that director. In order to enhance the power of our stockholders to influence the composition of the board of directors, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in an uncontested election of directors, any non-employee nominee who receives a greater number of votes AGAINST his or her election than votes FOR his or her election will promptly tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the resignation offer and make a recommendation to the board of directors. The board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. We will publicly disclose, in a Form 8-K furnished to the SEC, the board's decision regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant hereto shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation or Board of Directors action regarding whether to accept such resignations. However, if each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was not elected at the same election, then the independent directors who were elected shall appoint a committee among themselves to consider such resignations and recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept them. However, if the only directors who were elected in the same election constitute three or fewer directors, all directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept such resignations.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
Term Limits
​
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the board of directors will not nominate for re-election any non-employee director who has served 15 years or more prior to the applicable election, subject to exceptions granted by the board of directors.
Risk Oversight
​
The board of directors is involved in risk oversight through direct decision-making authority on significant matters as well as through the oversight of management and appropriate advice and counsel from legal, financial, and compensation advisors. In particular, the board of directors manages risk by reviewing and discussing periodic reports with management including, but not limited to, reports detailing Piedmont's risk related to its geographic, tenant, industry, and lease expiration concentrations as well as cyber risk. Through its various committees, the board monitors acquisition, disposition, leasing, financing, and cyber activities and has delegated authority to the appropriate levels of management to carry out such activities with appropriate governance reporting at respective committee meetings. 
In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee also monitors major issues regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentation and disclosures, including any significant changes in the application of accounting principles, and major issues regarding the adequacy of Piedmont's internal controls and analyses prepared by management and/or the independent registered public accounting firm setting forth significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of the financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee follows the effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives, as well as off-balance sheet structures, on Piedmont's financial statements and the type and presentation of financial information to be included in earnings press releases, reports, and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management Piedmont's major financial and cyber risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee is also periodically briefed on Piedmont's processes and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and the Audit Committee Chairman is interviewed in conjunction with Piedmont's annual risk assessment process. Finally, the Audit Committee is periodically briefed on insurance coverage limits, any significant change in Piedmont's insurance policies, monitoring of Piedmont's code of ethics, whistleblower policy, and insider trading policies, cyber activities, as well as quarterly REIT test and debt covenant compliance calculations. Piedmont's Insider Trading policy specifically prohibits trading in the Company's stock when the employee is aware of material, nonpublic information including, among other things, information concerning data securities breaches or other cyber security events impacting the Company or any of its substantial tenants or business partners.
​
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics
​
Our board of directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines establishing a common set of expectations to assist the board of directors in performing their responsibilities. The Corporate Governance Guidelines, which meet the requirements of the NYSE's listing standards, address a number of topics, including, among other things, director qualification standards, director responsibilities, the responsibilities and composition of the board committees, director access to management and independent advisers, director compensation, and evaluations of the performance of the board. Our board of directors has also adopted a Code of Ethics, including a conflicts of interest policy, that applies to all of our directors and executive officers including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the SEC. A copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.piedmontreit.com. Any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics will be disclosed on our website promptly following the date of such amendment or waivers.

Corporate Social Responsibility
The mission of Piedmont's corporate responsibility and charitable giving program is not only to provide the highest quality services to our tenants on a daily basis, but also to help meet the needs of each local community that we serve by volunteering and/or financially supporting programs related to medical or human needs and children's programs that improve the overall quality of life (particularly through charities tied to the real estate industry or our tenants). 
In 2015, Piedmont created the Piedmont W. Wayne Woody Foundation ("PWW Foundation") in honor of our late Chairman of the Board, W. Wayne Woody through which charitable contributions are distributed to various nonprofit organizations. Recipient organizations are 501(c)(3) entities that fit our charitable giving categories and demonstrate fiscal/administrative stability, including being non-discriminatory and non-political. 
In addition to financial contributions through the PWW Foundation, Piedmont recognizes the value and benefit of employee volunteerism and fully appreciates its positive impact on the community, the employees, and ultimately, the Company by promoting team building, collaboration, and unity. To promote volunteerism among Piedmont employees, the Company provides a matching program whereby an employee may request time away from work to support a community service project or activity. Preference is given to those organizations that are tied to real estate industry programs or that have a major tenant sponsorship. Our employees have partnered with Piedmont to donate thousands of dollars and hours annually to numerous organizations in each of the markets that Piedmont serves.

​
Sustainability
Piedmont is dedicated to environmentally sustainable practices that enhance our commitment to provide highest quality office properties. We strive to own and manage workplaces that are environmentally conscious, productive, and healthy for our tenants and employees by: 
➢
Empowering our property teams with the data and tools they need to sustainably manage their buildings; 
​
➢
Leveraging industry partnerships with BOMA, ENERGY STAR, and U.S. Green Building Council, to confirm and advance the energy and sustainability performance of our assets; and 
​
➢
Implementing processes that continually improve our environmental performance. 
​
The Sustainability Committee is comprised of the Senior Vice President of Property Management, Director of Property Management Operations, Director of Sustainability and National Initiatives, Director of Engineering, and all Regional Managers. Additionally, the Sustainability Committee utilizes a third party consultant to advise the group as needed. The team meets monthly to ensure Piedmont's energy and sustainability plans are on track. Some of the plan elements that have contributed to our progress include: prioritizing the portfolio for capital investment in energy efficiency projects, leveraging utility incentive programs to complete lighting and other efficiency projects, and encouraging building engineers to participate in energy efficient operations and training programs. The team continually considers new projects and evaluates opportunities as they arise. During 2018, representatives from the Sustainability Committee held meetings with each property team to review items such as: 
 — 
Recent operational and capital projects that may impact energy or water consumption 
​
 — 
Recent operational changes (i.e. major tenant shifts) that may impact energy or water consumption 
​
 — 
Recommendations for energy or water efficiency projects 
​
 — 
Best practice control strategies 
​
 — 
Available ENERGY STAR resources 
​
 — 
Review of Mach Energy profile 
​
 — 
Review of electricity tariffs 
​
As a result of these meetings, Energy & Sustainability Action Plans were created for each property. These action plans are used regularly by the property teams to track progress on identified action items and ultimately ensure progress towards energy and sustainability improvement across the portfolio, including attaining a 20% reduction in overall water and energy use intensity by 2028 and 2026, respectively. 
We also leverage our industry partnerships, including the Building Owners and Managers Association ("BOMA"), Energy Star® and the U.S. Green Building Counsel, to help us advance the energy and sustainability performance of 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
our assets. We are also a leading participant among REITs based on the number of buildings owned and managed with BOMA 360 designations. BOMA 360 is a program that evaluates six major areas of building operations and management and benchmarks a building's performance against industry standards. The achievement of such a designation recognizes excellence in building operations and management. We also have focused on environmental sustainability initiatives at our properties, and approximately 80% of our office portfolio (based on square footage) have achieved and maintain "Energy Star" efficiency (a designation for the top 25% of commercial buildings in energy consumption efficiency). In addition, approximately 40% of our office portfolio (based on square footage) is certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which designates commercial buildings that are designed, built and operated in a manner to minimize environmental impact. We have also been a silver member of the U.S. Green Building Counsel since 2007.

​
Stockholder Engagement and Outreach
Our commitment to understanding the interests and perspectives of our stockholders is a key component of our corporate governance strategy and compensation philosophy. Throughout the year, we meet with our investors to share our perspective and to solicit their feedback on our strategy and performance. During 2018, our executive management team participated in several investor conferences and approximately 200 one-on-one meetings with our investors and analysts. Periodically, we also hold investor days where our management team meets with stockholders and industry research analysts to discuss our strategy and performance and respond to questions, as well as to tour certain properties in our portfolio. Further, our board has periodically invited significant investors to meet with them directly and our management team has periodically engaged third parties to conduct perception surveys so that we can hear our stockholders' perspectives and opinions about the Company as we believe the insights provided by our stockholders provide valuable information to be considered in our strategic decisions. During 2018 our stockholders also approved an amendment to our Charter to clarify that our stockholders have the right to amend the Bylaws.
​
Communications with Stockholders or Other Interested Parties
We have established several means for stockholders or other interested parties to communicate their concerns to the board of directors. If the concern relates to our financial statements, accounting practices or internal controls, the concerns should be submitted in writing to the Chairman of our Audit Committee in care of our Secretary at our headquarters address. If the concern relates to our governance practices, business ethics or corporate conduct, the concern may be submitted in writing to the Chairman of our Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee in care of our Secretary at our headquarters address. If a stockholder is uncertain as to which category his or her concern relates, he or she may communicate it to any one of the independent directors in care of our Secretary at our headquarters address. Stockholders or other interested parties who wish to communicate with our Chairman or with the non-management directors as a group may do so by writing to our Chairman at our headquarters address.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
​
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis explains our compensation philosophy, objectives, policies and practices and the decisions made with respect to compensation for 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers, whom we refer to collectively as our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"), as determined in accordance with applicable SEC rules. 
Executive Summary
2018 was an excellent year from an operational perspective. Our Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") was in the top quartile relative to our peer group (see Market Reference Data below) for 2018. Overall leasing results were strong, with approximately 1.6 million square feet of leasing completed during the year including approximately 857,000 square feet of leasing related to new leases. Overall transactional activity was robust as well. We closed on the sale of a 14-property portfolio in early January 2018, sold our last remaining West Coast asset, and entered into a binding contract to sell a large non-core asset in Washington, D.C. These dispositions substantially completed our strategy of concentrating our assets in select sub markets located primarily within eight major U.S. office markets. A portion of the net sales proceeds from these dispositions was reinvested in three assets located within our strategic sub markets. We also completed over $1 billion of refinancings during the year (including the refinancing of our $500 million line of credit) and repurchased 16.5 million shares of our common stock. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $130.3 million and Same Store NOI(1) increased 6.5% on a year over year basis as compared to 2017 and reported occupancy of our in-service portfolio increased 360 basis points to 93.3% as of year end. As a result, we exceeded many of the 2018 quantitative metrics that had been established by the board at the beginning of the year, including achieving Core FFO per diluted share in excess of our annual target. However, we fell short of some of our ambitious leasing goals. Renewal leasing, and consequently renewal weighted average committed capital per square foot of lease term, were negatively impacted by the delay of the renewal of our largest tenant that is now expected to be completed in 2019, rather than in 2018. 
As a result of these achievements for 2018, our Compensation Committee and the board of directors approved a 5% increase in the board discretionary component of our NEOs Short-Term Incentive Compensation ("STIC") Plan. When combined with the results of various quantitative performance measures set forth below, the increase in the discretionary component resulted in the payment of STIC awards for 2018 of 29% above target for our Chief Executive Officer and 4-16% above target for our other NEOs, as compared with 10% above target and approximately 2% below target, respectively, for 2017 STIC Awards. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Compensation Committee also made deferred stock awards pursuant to our 2017 Long Term Incentive Compensation ("LTIC") Plan. For the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2017, our TSR ranked at just below the median compared to our peers, resulting in a payout at 94.2% of target level for the performance share component of our LTIC plan. For the annual deferred stock component of our LTIC plan, we performed above target for all three quantitative metrics as set forth under "Long-term Incentive Compensation, Annual Deferred Stock Grant" below and the Compensation Committee and board of directors approved achievement of the board discretion component of the 2017 Long Term Incentive Compensation ("LTIC") Plan at target level, resulting in awards approximately 16% above target levels in May of 2018.
Consideration of  "Say on Pay" Voting Results and Compensation Best Practices
At our 2018 annual meeting, we held a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs for 2017. Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our NEOs, with approximately 97% of stockholder votes cast in favor of our "say on pay" resolution. Based on these results, we believe our programs are effectively designed and working well in alignment with the interests of our stockholders. Further, we believe that our compensation programs include a number of best practices such as:

Same Store NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the definition of Same Store NOI and the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Piedmont to Same Store NOI on pages 35 – 37 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
➢
Our compensation of our Chief Executive Officer generally places a greater emphasis (82%) on variable, performance-based compensation than typical market practice; 
​
➢
61% of our Chief Executive Officer's pay opportunity is in the form of long-term, equity based compensation; 
​
➢
Approximately 50% of the target for our LTIC Plan is delivered in the form of performance shares, which are earned based on our multi-year TSR relative to our peers; 
​
➢
All of our short-term and long-term incentive programs contain caps on payouts and minimum thresholds for awards, and our Compensation Committee reserves the right to decrease payouts in their discretion; 
​
➢
The quantitative metrics of all of our incentive-based pay programs are tied to operational, financial, or market performance measures derived from our annual business plan; 
​
➢
Our employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and certain other of our officers contain "clawback" provisions, which require them to reimburse us for incentive-based compensation they have received if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws (see "Executive Clawback Provisions" below for further details); 
​
➢
Our NEOs and directors are required to meet stock ownership guidelines; 
​
➢
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits hedging and pledging of our stock by our executive officers and directors; 
​
➢
We award minimal perquisites and no supplemental executive benefits to our NEOs; and 
​
➢
We do not provide tax gross ups to our NEOs. 
​
As a result of the above considerations, our Compensation Committee decided to retain our general approach to executive compensation for 2018, which links the compensation of our NEOs to our operating objectives and emphasizes the enhancement of TSR. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
We seek to maintain a total compensation package that provides fair, reasonable and competitive compensation for our executives while also permitting us the flexibility to differentiate actual pay based on the level of individual and organizational performance. We place significant emphasis on annual and long-term performance-based incentive compensation, including cash and equity-based incentives, which are designed to reward our executives based on the achievement of predetermined individual and company goals, including, among others, TSR relative to a comparative peer group as further described below. 
The objectives of our executive compensation programs are: 
➢
to attract and retain candidates capable of performing at the highest levels of our industry; 
​
➢
to create and maintain a performance-focused culture, by rewarding company and individual performance based upon objective predetermined metrics; 
​
➢
to reflect the qualifications, skills, experience and responsibilities of each NEO; 
​
➢
to link incentive compensation levels with the creation of stockholder value; 
​
➢
to align the interests of our executives and stockholders by creating opportunities and incentives for executives to increase their equity ownership; and 
​
➢
to motivate our executives to manage our business to meet and appropriately balance our short- and long-term objectives. 
​
Compensation Committee Responsibilities
Our executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee sets the overall compensation strategy and compensation policies for our executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the form and amount of compensation appropriate to achieve our strategic objectives, including salary, bonus, incentive or performance-based compensation, and equity awards. The Compensation Committee reviews its compensation strategy annually to confirm that it supports our objectives and stockholders' interests and that executive officers are being rewarded in a manner that is consistent with our strategy. 
With respect to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee is responsible for: 
➢
reviewing and approving our corporate goals and objectives with respect to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer; 
​
➢
evaluating the Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of those goals and objectives; and
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
➢
determining the Chief Executive Officer's compensation (including annual base salary level, annual cash bonus, long-term incentive compensation awards, perquisites and any special or supplemental benefits) based on such evaluation. 
​
With respect to the compensation of NEOs other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee is responsible for: 
➢
reviewing and approving the compensation; and 
​
➢
reviewing and approving grants and awards under all incentive-based compensation plans and equity-based plans. 
​
Role of the Compensation Consultant
To assist in carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee utilized the services of FTI Consulting, Inc. ("FTI"), a nationally recognized compensation consulting firm, to assist it in establishing our 2018 compensation plans and analyzing competitive executive compensation levels for 2018. FTI was not engaged by management to perform any work on its behalf during 2018 and the Compensation Committee considered FTI to be independent with regard to services performed on its behalf during 2018. 
During 2018, FTI provided advice and recommendations regarding our short and long term incentive compensation plans for our employees, including our NEOs. In addition, FTI provided our Compensation Committee input on our director compensation program, competitive market compensation data and recommendations for target pay levels for each component of our 2018 executive compensation program. 
The FTI compensation consultant periodically attends Compensation Committee meetings as requested by the Compensation Committee and consults with our Compensation Committee Chairman, our Director of Human Resources, our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer as directed by the Compensation Committee on compensation related issues.

During 2018, the Company requested and received information from FTI addressing its independence and potential conflicts of interest, including the following factors: (1) other services provided to us by the consultant; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm's total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a member of the Compensation Committee; (5) any company stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. Based on an assessment of these factors, including information gathered from directors and executive officers addressing business or personal relationships with the consulting firm or the individual consultants, the Compensation Committee concluded that FTI is independent and that the work of FTI did not raise any conflict of interest. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions
Our Chief Executive Officer reviewed the performance of each of the other NEOs and considered the recommendations of the FTI consultant with regard to each of the other NEOs. Based on this review and input, he made compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee for all of the NEOs other than himself, including recommendations for performance targets, base salary adjustments, the discretionary components of our short-term cash incentive compensation, and long-term equity-based incentive awards. The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations along with data and input provided by FTI. The Compensation Committee retains full discretion to set all compensation for the executive officers.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Market Reference and Benchmark Compensation Data
In October 2018, FTI provided our Compensation Committee with a competitive market analysis of our NEOs' pay level relative to the practices of a peer group of 12 public REITs. The peer group includes companies that either primarily invest in office properties or are diversified REITs whose portfolio includes significant office assets. In addition, companies that were recommended were generally no less than half the size and no more than two and a half times as large as Piedmont. The following table provides the names and estimated financial information for each peer company at the time the Compensation Committee reviewed the market data in October 2018:

The above companies are consistent with the peer group used for market comparison in 2017 with the exception of the removal of Douglas Emmett, Inc. from the group as Douglas Emmett, Inc. is more than three times larger than Piedmont on a market capitalization basis and operates in a high cost of living area; Douglas Emmett was replaced with TIER REIT, Inc. an office REIT that fits within the targeted size parameters and also operates primarily in mid-size cities. In general, Piedmont ranks in the bottom and second quartile of implied equity market capitalization and enterprise value, respectively, as compared to the peer group. 
We apply our compensation policies to all of our NEOs on the same basis, with differences in compensation opportunities between each of our executive officers reflecting each of the officers' roles, responsibilities and personal performance within our Company, as well as market pay practices. In October 2018, FTI provided our Compensation Committee with an analysis of each of our NEO's 2018 target pay opportunity and 2017 reported pay relative to the compensation paid to executives employed by the peer group above in comparable positions to each of our NEOs. The analysis utilized the most recently filed proxy for each company in the peer group and FTI's proprietary compensation database. Additionally, for each of our EVPs, other than our Chief Financial Officer, supplemental peer group data for applicable benchmark peers based on FTI's proprietary compensation database was utilized in the analysis. Benchmark peer data used to compare each of our NEOs compensation was as follows:

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
In addition to considering market reference data set forth above in making decisions about our NEOs' compensation opportunities and actual compensation to be paid, the Compensation Committee considers other factors such as each executive officer's experience, scope of responsibilities, performance and prospects; internal equity in relation to other executive officers with similar levels of experience, scope of responsibilities, performance and prospects; and individual performance of each NEO during their tenure with Piedmont.
​
Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation
​
Base Salary
Our Compensation Committee believes that payment of a competitive base salary is a necessary element of any compensation program that is designed to attract and retain talented and qualified executives. The goal of our base salary program is to provide salaries at a level that allows us to attract and retain qualified executives while preserving significant flexibility to recognize and reward individual performance with other elements of the overall compensation program. Base salary levels also affect short-term cash incentive compensation because each NEO's target opportunity is expressed as a percentage of base salary. The following items are generally considered by the Compensation Committee when determining base salary annual increases; however no particular weight is assigned to an individual item: 
➢
market data provided by the compensation consultant; 
​
➢
comparability to compensation practices of other office REITs of similar size; 
​
➢
our financial resources;
​
➢
the executive officer's experience, scope of responsibilities, performance and prospects; 
​
➢
internal equity in relation to other executive officers with similar levels of experience, scope of responsibilities, performance, and prospects; and 
​
➢
individual performance of each NEO during the preceding calendar year. 
​
For 2018, FTI recommended 4-5% market adjustments for our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as their salaries had not been increased since 2014, a 16.7% increase for Mr. Smith based on his promotion to Chief Investment Officer during late 2017, a 3% increase for Mr. Wiberg, and no increase for Mr. Kollme as he was hired in mid-2017. After considering the data provided by FTI as well as Chief Executive Officer feedback regarding individual performance, our Compensation Committee approved base salaries for our NEOs for 2018 as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table included in 2018 Executive Compensation Tables below. Additionally, in February 2019, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Smith's salary to $425,000, retroactive to the date of his promotion to President and Chief Investment Officer in November of 2018.
​
Short-Term Cash Incentive Compensation Plan
We provide an annual STIC Plan for our NEOs which sets forth target cash incentive payments as a percentage of each NEO's base salary as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name and Position   ​ ​  Threshold   ​ ​  Target   ​ ​  Maximum   ​ 
[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS
The actual amounts earned under the STIC Plan may be greater or less than the NEO's respective target based on actual performance against the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each year, as well as assessment of each NEO's personal contributions and performance for the year. The following table sets forth the relative weighting of each of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for the 2018 STIC Plan: 
All of the performance measures established by the Compensation Committee for 2018 were based on specific corporate metrics measured on a quantitative basis, with the exception of the Board Discretion/Individual Performance measure which the Compensation Committee considered on a qualitative basis. Those qualitative considerations included, but were not limited to, the Chief Executive Officer's assessment of each NEO's performance other than his own. The performance goals that the Compensation Committee established for each of the quantitative metrics were derived from critical components of our annual business plan for the year and were considered achievable, but not without above average performance. 2018 target and actual performance for each of the STIC performance goals were as follows:

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Core FFO performance is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered important because our ability to meet consensus estimates of Core FFO is a factor when equity analysts value, or when present or potential stockholders make investment decisions about, our securities. See the definition of Core FFO and the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Piedmont to Core FFO on pages 33 – 35 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Every 1% variance in performance increases or decreases the targeted award by 10%, based on relative weighting 
Balance Sheet Management is important because maintaining the appropriate capital structure, including the magnitude of total debt, mix of unsecured vs secured debt, impact upon Net Debt to EBITDA ratio, compliance with debt covenants, debt to gross assets ratio, and laddering of maturities is critical to the overall financial strength of the Company. Additionally, as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"), we are required to pay out 90% of our taxable income each year in the form of dividends to our stockholders. Therefore, we must constantly manage credit ratios and proactively seek new sources of capital for our Company which requires careful management of the magnitude, timing, and cost of our borrowings. Individual metrics are measured as "Achieved" resulting in full target payout or "Not Achieved" resulting in no payout; however, if all metrics are achieved, then the maximum award is deemed earned, based on relative weighting. 
Weighted Average Committed Capital Per Square Foot measures the future capital outlays that our management team has committed to in order to execute leases during the current year. This metric serves as a cross-check to ensure that management does not trade long-term capital expenditures to procure short-term growth in Core FFO. The target performance level for this metric is based on goals for commitments that are market specific and the weighted average performance goal is a function of the level of actual leasing activity in our respective markets. Every 1% variance in performance increases or decreases the targeted award by 5%, based on relative weighting. The renewal weighted average committed capital per square foot leased target for 2018 included budgeted capital related to the renewal of our largest tenant, New York State, who currently occupies approximately 481,000 square feet at our 60 Broad Street building in New York. Although the Company is in advanced stages of the lease renewal process, as of December 31, 2018 the renewal lease had not yet been executed, causing actual results to fall short of the established renewal weighted average committed capital per square foot leased goal for the year. 
Leasing Targets are important as managing lease renewals, leasing up vacant space, and keeping our portfolio as fully leased as possible directly impacts our cash flow, financial results, and value of our equity securities. Targets are directly tied to our annual business plan and the renewal target included an additional 600,000 square feet of leasing above the renewal square footage included in our annual plan. Every 1% variance in performance increases or decreases the targeted award by 2%, based on relative weighting. The renewal leasing target for 2018 included the renewal of our largest tenant, New York State, who currently occupies approximately 481,000 square feet at our 60 Broad Street building in New York. Although the Company is in advanced stages of the lease renewal process, as of December 31, 2018 the lease had not yet been executed, causing actual results to fall short of the renewal leasing goal for the year. 
Capital Allocations/Markets refers to how we allocate our capital resources, whether it be to acquire new properties or to repurchase shares of our common stock, and is important because it impacts the overall composition and quality of our portfolio of assets, as well as our competitiveness within each of our markets. The quality of our portfolio and our management team's ability to allocate capital resources effectively are two factors that equity analysts and present or potential stockholders consider when they assess our overall enterprise value. Any shortfall in our capital acquisitions target may be offset on a dollar for dollar basis by share repurchases pursuant to our board approved stock repurchase program. Every 1% variance in performance increases or decreases the targeted award by 2%, based on relative weighting. 
The Board Discretion component is considered important as it allows the Compensation Committee to appropriately reward aspects of the management team's or individual's performance that may not be captured through the use of the quantitative metrics. For 2018, our Compensation Committee and the board of directors considered the fact that the management team had materially achieved target or above average performance on all of the STIC quantitative metrics with the exception of two that were specifically negatively impacted by the timing of the New York State renewal mentioned above, and thus approved achievement of the board discretion component within our NEOs STIC Plan at above target levels. Consequently, the Compensation Committee increased the payout associated with the Board discretion component by 5%, with individual awards subject to further adjustment based on individual performance as described below. 
Actual awards are calculated based on performance against the above metrics with performance below threshold for an individual component resulting in no payout for that particular component and out

performance for each component being capped at 200% for our Chief Executive Officer and 150% for our other NEOs. In February 2019, after (i) reviewing the results of the quantitative performance measures as set forth in the table above; (ii) considering the Chief Executive Officer's assessment of each of the other NEO's performance; and (iii) assessing the Chief Executive Officer's performance, the Compensation Committee determined actual awards for the 2018 performance period for each individual NEO as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan
The objective of our LTIC Plan is to attract and retain qualified personnel by offering an equity-based program that is competitive with our peer companies and that is designed to encourage each of our NEOs, as well as our broader employee base, to balance long-term company performance with short-term company goals and to foster employee retention. Each NEO's annual LTIC target opportunity is divided equally between a Performance Share Program and an Annual Deferred Stock Unit Opportunity. The following table sets forth the relative weighting of each of the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for the LTIC Plan: 
​
Performance Share Program. Approximately half of our NEOs' LTIC opportunity relates to a multi-year performance share compensation program (the "Performance Share Program"). The purpose of the Performance Share Program is to motivate and reward long term performance. Participants are provided with the opportunity to earn shares of Piedmont stock based on our TSR performance relative to a broad, pre-determined peer group over a three-year performance period. Performance cycles overlap, with a new three-year performance cycle beginning each year. The TSR Percentile Rank for each active plan will continue to change throughout the respective performance period. 
After the end of each three-year performance period, any earned awards will be paid by the Company based upon actual relative performance against the board-determined peer group. A grant date for each Performance Share Program is established when the Compensation Committee and the board of directors approve the multi-year plan. In accordance with SEC rules, the grant date fair value of the Performance Share Program, assuming target performance over the applicable three-year period, is included in the Summary Compensation Table in the year of grant. As such, the following discussion pertains to the 2018 – 20 Performance Share Program. 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
The peer group for the 2018 – 20 Performance Period was established at the beginning of the 2018 calendar year and included the same companies listed under "Market Reference Data" above, plus Douglas Emmett, Inc., Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., and Franklin Street Properties Corp. These three additional companies were not included in the "Market Reference Data" analysis compiled by our compensation consultant because Douglas Emmett, Inc. Franklin Street Properties Corp., and Empire State Realty Trust, Inc. either did not fit the desired size profile or the compensation consultant felt that the cost of living was too disparate with Atlanta and would unfairly skew the market compensation data used for comparison purposes.
Participants in the Performance Share Program have a defined target award expressed as a number of shares. The target number of shares established for each participant may be earned if Piedmont's TSR is at the median of the peer group, up to 200% of target may be earned if Piedmont's TSR is at or above the 75th percentile of the peer group, and 50% of target may be earned if Piedmont's TSR at the 25th percentile of the peer group. No shares are earned if Piedmont's TSR is below the 25th percentile. If our return is between the 25th and 75th percentile, the payout will be determined by linear interpolation. The following table sets forth the status of each active Performance Share Plan as of December 31, 2018:
​
For the range of shares that could be earned by each NEO for the 2018 – 20 performance period, see the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table under 2018 Executive Compensation Tables below. 
Annual Deferred Stock Unit Opportunity. The other half of our NEOs' LTIC opportunity is based upon an annual targeted dollar value of deferred stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee, that considers four performance measures. While such measures establish a framework for the Compensation Committee to evaluate performance, the actual award is ultimately established by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion irrespective of actual performance. As such, a grant date for accounting purposes is not established until the Compensation Committee has reviewed the Company's actual performance against the metrics, determined the value of stock to be awarded, noted the current market value of stock, and exercised its discretion to determine the pool of shares to be awarded. This process normally occurs during the calendar year following the performance period after year-end audit results are available. In accordance with SEC rules, therefore, the deferred stock units awarded pursuant to this component of our LTIC plan are included in the Summary Compensation Table in the calendar year of the award, which is subsequent to the performance period. As such, the follow discussion pertains to the annual deferred stock unit award made in calendar 2018 based on the 2017 performance period.
​
The performance targets that the Compensation Committee established for the quantitative metrics for the 2017 performance period were considered achievable, but not without above average performance. The following table sets forth the target goals for each of the quantitative measures as well as the actual results for each performance measure (dollars in millions except for per share amounts):

Core FFO performance is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered important because our ability to meet consensus estimates of Core FFO is a factor when equity analysts value, or when present or potential stockholders make investment decisions about, our securities. See the definition of Core FFO and the reconciliation of Net income attributable to Piedmont to Core FFO on pages 33 – 35 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Actual Adjusted Funds from Operations ("AFFO") Before Capital Expenditures vs Budget is a non-GAAP financial measure that more closely mirrors the actual cash flow generated by the company in that it removes certain non-cash revenue and expense items such as the effect of straight-line rents which are not adjusted when computing FFO in accordance with the definition established by NAREIT. AFFO is considered important because it measures the Company's ability to fund dividends and debt repayments, as well as acquisitions and other capital expenditures. 
Actual General and Administrative Expense Relative to Budget is a non-GAAP financial measure that is considered important because it measures how efficiently we manage our controllable overhead expenses such as corporate labor, professional services, and stockholder communication expenses, among others. 
The Board Discretion component allows the Compensation Committee to appropriately recognize aspects of the management team's or individual's performance that may not be captured through the use of the quantitative metrics. For the 2017 deferred stock grant opportunity, our Compensation Committee and the board of directors unanimously approved achievement of this component at target. The Compensation Committee and the board of directors relied heavily on the quantitative measures that were approved at the beginning of the performance period, recognizing that the management team exceeded all three metrics.
​
Each individual NEO's targeted number of shares was established by the Compensation Committee based on recommendations from our compensation consultant and Chief Executive Officer for each NEO, other than himself, regarding comparability with awards to officers of our peer group of office REITs as well as taking into consideration each officer's salary and experience level. The actual number of shares that each individual NEO was eligible to earn was determined by the Compensation Committee after considering performance against the above metrics according to the following scale:

​
​
After considering the metrics above, as well as the CEO's evaluation of the performance of each NEO other than himself, on May 17, 2018 the Compensation Committee determined the number of deferred stock units to be granted to each of our NEOs pursuant to the 2017 Deferred Stock Unit Opportunity. See "Grants of Plan Based Awards for 2018" table below for information on the number of deferred stock units granted to each of the NEOs during 2018. For the awards granted, 25% vested immediately, while the remaining 75% vests in 25% increments over the next three years on the grant anniversary date. Any dividend equivalent rights are paid out upon vesting of the underlying shares. 
To date, LTIC awards have only been granted in the form of performance shares or deferred stock units pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders. The Compensation 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Committee has determined that, as a REIT, the grant of such awards is appropriate because our high dividend distribution requirements lead to a significant portion of our total stockholder return being delivered through our dividends. Although our Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan permits the issuance of other types of equity awards, including stock options, we have never issued stock options to any of our employees, including our NEOs, and anticipate that any future equity awards granted will continue to be similar in form to our previous awards. Further, our Compensation Committee has prohibited the cash buyout of underwater options, should any options ever be issued. Although we have not attached specific holding periods for our equity-based awards, in general our equity-based awards vest or are earned over a three year period. In addition, each of our executive officers, including our NEOs, is subject to stock ownership requirements (see Stock Ownership Guidelines below). We feel that appropriately designed equity-based awards, particularly those with future vesting provisions, promote a performance-focused culture and align our employees' interests with those of our stockholders, thereby motivating their efforts on our behalf and strengthening their desire to remain with us for an extended period of time. 
Benefits
All of our NEOs participate in the health and welfare benefit programs, including medical, dental and vision care coverage, disability, long-term care and life insurance, and our 401(k) plan that are generally available to the rest of our employees. We do not have any special benefits or retirement plans for our NEOs other than the ability to defer certain amounts of their compensation in a non-qualified deferral plan and an annual physical for our Chief Executive Officer.
​
Employment and Other Agreements with our Named Executive Officers
​
Employment Agreements
We are currently party to employment agreements with all of our NEOs other than Mr. Wiberg. Messrs. Miller and Bowers' agreements were originally put in place in 2007 and Messrs. Kollme and Smith's agreements were put in place in 2019. Each of these agreements renew annually unless either party gives 90 days written notice prior to the end of the renewal term or his employment otherwise terminates in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Significant terms include executive clawback provisions and severance in the event of certain circumstances as further described below:
Executive Clawback Provisions. If we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, Messrs. Miller, Bowers, Smith, and Kollme's agreements contain provisions that provide for the executive to reimburse us, to the extent required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for any incentive-based (whether cash or equity-based) compensation received by the executives from us during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing with the SEC (whichever occurs first) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement. In addition, each executive will reimburse us for any profits realized from the sale of our securities during that 12-month period.
Severance. Messrs. Miller, Bowers, Kollme and Smith's employment agreements entitle them to receive severance payments under certain circumstances in the event that their employment is terminated. These circumstances and payments are described below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control." Our Compensation Committee believes that these severance payments were an important factor in attracting these individuals to join our Company and/or are an important factor in their retention. The agreements with these individuals do not provide for tax "gross ups" in the event such payments are made.
Retirement Agreement
In connection with his announced retirement, we entered into a retirement agreement with Mr. Miller in March 2019. Under the terms of the Retirement Agreement, effective the date of his retirement (the "Retirement Date"), Mr. Miller is entitled to receive payment of certain accrued benefits, including accrued but unpaid base salary, accrued but unused vacation time, and other benefits through the Retirement Date, as well as payment of a pro-rata portion of his outstanding Performance Share Program awards (including for the 2019-21 performance cycle), determined based on the Company's relative TSR performance as of the Retirement Date. Mr. Miller will also be entitled to receive certain additional retirement benefits, subject to entering into and not revoking the Retirement Agreement and customary release agreement, which include vesting in full of any unvested deferred stock units granted under the Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Incentive, a retirement payment equal to $1,050,000 to be paid within 30 days after the Retirement Date, and COBRA premiums for continued medical coverage following the Retirement Date.

Each of our NEOs, other than Mr. Kollme who became employed by us in June of 2017, has met his respective ownership requirement. Mr. Kollme has until June of 2023 to meet his ownership requirement and he is required to hold 60% of the net shares he is granted by us as compensation until his ownership requirement is met. 
In addition, each member of our board of directors is required to own the lesser of 15,000 shares or $250,000. All of our directors currently meet this requirement, with the exception of Ms. Lang and Mr. Taysom, each of whom will have six years from the date they joined the board to meet the requirement.
​
Hedging, Pledging and Insider Trading Policy
​
Our insider trading policy prohibits our employees, officers and directors from hedging their ownership of our stock, including a prohibition on short sales and buying or selling of puts and calls. Our insider trading policy also prohibits our employees, officers and directors from purchasing or selling our securities while in possession of material non-public information including, among other things, information concerning data securities breaches or other cyber security events impacting the Company or any of its substantial tenants or business partners. 
Our insider trading policy also prohibits our executive officers and directors from pledging our securities or otherwise using our securities as collateral. None of our executive officers or directors holds any of our stock subject to pledge.
​
Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Compensation
​
Section 162(m) of the Code limits to $1.0 million a publicly held company's tax deduction each year for compensation to any "covered employee." As a REIT, to the extent that any part of our compensation expense does not qualify for deduction under Section 162(m), a larger portion of stockholder distributions may be subject to federal income tax as ordinary income rather than return of capital, and any such compensation allocated to our taxable REIT subsidiary, whose income is subject to federal income tax, would result in an increase in income taxes due to the inability to deduct such compensation. 
Although we and the Compensation Committee are mindful of the limits imposed by Section 162(m), even if Section 162(m) applies to certain compensation packages, we nevertheless reserve the right to structure compensation packages and awards in a manner that may exceed the limitation on deduction imposed by Section 162(m).

In accordance with SEC rules, the stock award column includes the annual deferred stock grant and the estimated aggregate grant date fair value of the Performance Share Component of our LTIC program at target levels, even though there is no guarantee that any amounts will ultimately be earned by and paid to the executive. See "Realized Pay Table" and "Stock Vested" table below for the value of actual stock awards which vested during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of potential awards under the 2018 – 20 Performance Share Program at target levels and the deferred stock awards granted in 2018 for 2017 performance, both under our LTIC program. Values are estimated as the total expense associated with each grant to be recognized for financial statement reporting purposes over the respective service period associated with each grant calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, Share-Based Payments. Pursuant to SEC rules the values are not reduced by an estimate for the probability of forfeiture. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 2017 annual deferred stock award granted in 2018 was based on the closing price of our common stock on the May 17, 2018 grant date of  $17.84 per share. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 2018 Performance Share Program was based on an estimated fair value per share as of the grant date of  $23.52 per share utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model that models the plan's potential payoff depending on Piedmont's and its peer group's future stock price movements. The potential value of the 2018-20 Performance Share Program award at the grant date assuming the highest level of performance conditions were achieved would have been (in 000's): Miller — $3,428; Bowers — $1,252; Kollme — $461; Smith — $461 and Wiberg — $461.

Pursuant to SEC rules the values are not reduced by an estimate for the probability of forfeiture. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 2016 annual deferred stock award granted in 2017 was based on the closing price of our common stock on the May 18, 2017 grant date of  $21.38 per share. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 2017 Performance Share Program was based on an estimated fair value per share as of the grant date of  $30.45 per share utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model that models the plan's potential payoff depending on Piedmont's and its peer group's future stock price movements. The potential value of the 2017 – 19 Performance Share Program award at the grant date assuming the highest level of performance conditions were achieved would have been (in 000's): Miller — $3,561; Bowers — $1,282; Kollme — $498; Smith — $498 and Wiberg — $498.

Realized Pay Table
As noted in the Summary Compensation Table above, SEC rules require the stock award column of the Summary Compensation Table to include the estimated aggregate grant date fair value (calculated utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model that models the plan's potential payoff depending on Piedmont's and its peer group's future stock price movements) of the performance share component of our LTIC program at target levels, even though there is no guarantee that any amounts will ultimately be earned by and paid to the executive. In addition, SEC rules require the entire aggregate grant date fair value of the deferred stock award component of our LTIC program to be included in the year the award is granted although such awards vest over a three-year period. As a supplement to the Summary Compensation Table, the table below shows the compensation actually realized by each of our NEOs during the three years ended December 31, 2018. The realized pay during the three year period is less than the value shown in the summary compensation table as the realized pay, specifically the value of vesting stock awards, is affected by our stock price performance, and as such, reflects the pay for performance orientation of our executive compensation program. TABLE OF CONTENTS
In the table below, the stock award column is calculated by multiplying the number of shares that actually vested during the respective year by our closing stock price on the vesting date, and adding the value of any dividend equivalents rights that were paid to the NEO in conjunction with the vestings of the stock:

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Piedmont offers a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDCP") to certain of its employees, including our NEOs, whereby employees may elect to defer a portion of their salary, STIC or LTIC for any given year. Any amounts deferred by the employee are retained by the Company in a Rabbi Trust until the payout date selected by the participant. The participant directs the investment of the funds while they are retained in the Rabbi Trust (which is subject to corporate creditors' rights) by selecting from various investment options that closely approximate the investment options available to our employees who participate in our 401(k) plan. None of our NEOs participated in the NQDCP during the year ended December 31, 2018. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control
Potential Payments Pursuant to Agreements in Place as of December 31, 2018. 
As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Miller and Bowers were our only two NEOs that had an employment agreement with us. The terms of their employment agreements are identical and provide for a cash payment in the event of their termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, both as defined in their employment agreements and including in the event of a change of control, or in the case of their death or disability. The cash payment is comprised of the following: (i) a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination based on the number of service months worked in the year divided by 12; (ii) the executive's annual salary and average bonus (based on bonuses paid over the last three years) times 2; and (iii) two years of continuing medical benefits (one year in the case of death or disability).
In addition, all of the participants in our Performance Share Program (including our NEOs) are entitled to receive a pro-rata share of any unvested Performance Share Program awards (see Elements of 2018 Executive Compensation -Long-term Incentive Compensation above) in the event of their termination without Cause or resignation and all of our employees' (including our NEOs') unvested Deferred Stock Unit Awards vest in the event of a change of control of the Company or upon the employees' retirement (defined as minimum age 62), termination without cause, death, or disability. Further, all of our salaried employees, including our NEOs, would receive the following types of accrued benefits upon termination of employment:
➢
any earned but unpaid annual salary, vacation or annual bonus for the year prior to termination;
​
➢
any un-reimbursed expenses;
​
➢
distribution of balances under our 401(k) plan;
​
➢
life insurance proceeds in the event of death; and
​
➢
disability insurance payouts in the event of disability.
​
The following table quantifies the potential cash or estimated equivalent cash value of amounts that would be payable to each NEO under the various termination scenarios described above, assuming the event occurred on December 31, 2018:

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
The estimated value of all unvested equity awards in the above table is based our closing stock price as of December 31, 2018 of  $17.04 per share, plus applicable dividend equivalent rights that would vest upon the vesting of the underlying shares. Further, the estimated value of all unvested performance share awards in the above table is based on the Company's relative TSR performance for each performance period as of December 31, 2018.
None of our employment or other compensatory agreements provide for tax "gross ups" in the event that any of the above payments are made.
Potential Payments Pursuant to Agreements Put in Place Subsequent to December 31, 2018. 
As described above under "Employment and Other Agreements with our NEOs", subsequent to December 31, 2018 we entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Kollme and Smith and a Retirement Agreement with Mr. Miller.
Mr. Smith's employment agreement entitles him to a cash payment based on identical terms to Messrs. Bowers and Miller in the event of his termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, except that change of control is omitted from the definition of Good Reason. Mr. Kollme's employment agreement entitles him to a cash payment based on identical terms to Mr. Smith, except that he is only entitled to one year of annual salary and average bonus and one year of medical benefits. After giving consideration to these agreements, in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above, Messrs. Kollme and Smith would also be entitled to potential cash payments of approximately $748,077 and $1,914, 352, respectively in the event of a termination without Cause, resignation for Good Reason (both as defined in their employment agreements) or death or disability.
In addition to the pro-rated value of Mr. Miller's unvested Performance Share Program awards set forth under the "Resignation without Good Reason" scenario in the table above, Mr. Miller's Retirement Agreement stipulates that all of his unvested Deferred Stock Unit Awards (estimated value of  $2,066,504 as of December 31, 2018 based on our closing stock price as of December 31, 2018 of  $17.04 per share, plus applicable dividend equivalent rights that would vest upon the vesting of the underlying shares) will vest upon his Retirement Date, as defined in his Retirement Agreement and that he will receive a one-time retirement payment equal to $1,050,000 to be paid within 30 days after the Retirement Date, and COBRA premiums for continued medical coverage following the Retirement Date.

Compensation Committee Report
​
The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things, reviewing and approving compensation for the executive officers, establishing the performance goals on which the compensation plans are based and setting the overall compensation principles that guide the committee's decision-making. The Compensation Committee has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") and discussed it with management. Based on the review and the discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the board of directors that the CD&A be included in this 2019 proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
​
None of the members of our Compensation Committee is or has been employed by us. None of our executive officers currently serve, or in the past three years has served, as a member of the board of directors or Compensation Committee of another entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
We pay our non-employee directors a combination of cash and equity compensation for serving on the board of directors. 
Cash Compensation
As compensation for serving on the board of directors, during 2018 we paid each of our non-employee directors an annual retainer of  $65,000 ($72,500 for Audit Committee members excluding the Chairman) and paid our chairman of the board an additional $50,000 annual retainer. Additionally, we also paid annual retainers to each of our committee chairmen in the following amounts: 
➢
$20,000 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee; 
​
➢
$15,000 to the Chairman of the Compensation Committee; and 
​
➢
$10,000 to the Chairman of each of our other committees. 
​
All directors may receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the board of directors. We do not provide any perquisites to our directors. 
Non-Employee Director Equity Awards
Non-employee directors are granted an equity award pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan either annually or upon their initial appointment to the board of directors. The annual award is equivalent to $80,000 payable in the form of shares of our common stock and vests upon the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual stockholders meeting. The amount of the award was determined based on the advice and recommendation of our compensation consultant after considering the peer group described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Effective as of the Annual Meeting, the dollar amount of annual non-employee director equity awards will increase to $90,000.
2018 Director Compensation Paid
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation that we paid to any person that served as one of our non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2018. Mr. Miller and Mr. Smith, employees of the Company, do not receive any additional compensation for their service as directors.

CEO PAY RATIO
Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K sets forth "CEO pay ratio" disclosure requirements that were mandated by Congress pursuant to Section 953(b) of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The rule requires registrants to disclose the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to their Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer pay ratio set forth below is a reasonable estimate that has been calculated in accordance with the SEC's rules regarding the Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure requirements. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 134 full-time employees, with 49 of our employees working in our corporate office located in Atlanta, Georgia, and our remaining employees working in regional and local management offices located primarily in our eight major U.S. markets. These employees are involved in acquiring, developing, leasing, and managing our portfolio of properties. Approximately 67% of our workforce is salaried, with the remaining 33% compensated on an hourly basis. 
SEC rules allow us to identify our median employee once every three years unless there has been a change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in our CEO pay ratio disclosure. Accordingly, our 2018 CEO pay ratio is calculated utilizing the same median employee identified in 2017. In determining that it was still appropriate to utilize our 2017 median employee for this disclosure, we considered the changes to our employee population and compensation programs during 2018, as well as the absence of a material change in that employee's job description or compensation during 2018. 
During 2017, we identified our median employee by calculating the total 2017 compensation of each of our employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, that was included on our November 24, 2017 payroll using the same SEC rules and methodology that were used to calculate our NEOs total compensation as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below. For employees that were not employed by us for the entire fiscal year, wages and salaries, matching contributions to 401(k), and premiums for company paid life insurance were annualized. Other than annualizing these components, we made no other assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to our employees' total compensation and used this consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total compensation of our median employee was $111,817, and our Chief Executive Officer's total compensation as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below was $5,081,683. The resulting ratio of the total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer compared to that of our median employee for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 45.4:1. 
The Summary Compensation Table includes stock grants at the estimated fair value of performance shares at target. No value will be realized unless performance targets are realized, and there is no guarantee that this amount will ultimately be earned and paid to our Chief Executive Officer. 
The Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosed above was calculated in accordance with SEC rules based upon the methodology described above. The SEC rules do not specify a single methodology for identification of the median employee or calculation of the Chief Executive Officer pay ratio, and other companies may use assumptions and methodologies that  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
are different from those used by us in calculating their Chief Executive Officer pay ratio. Accordingly, the Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to our Chief Executive Officer pay ratio as disclosed above. 
COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS THEY RELATE TO RISK MANAGEMENT
To address potential risk to our stockholders our Compensation Committee designed our compensation programs with the following characteristics: 
➢
the Compensation Committee of the board of directors has discretion to adjust any award that is earned based on achievement of performance goals. If the Compensation Committee believes that any of the targets set forth in the compensation plans has been achieved in a manner that is not consistent with the long-term best interests of the Company's stockholders, or believes that the overall compensation to be paid under the terms of the plan is not appropriate for any reason, the Compensation Committee may adjust the calculated compensation associated with that plan accordingly; 
​
➢
oversight of programs (or components of programs) by a broad-based group of individuals, including human resources, finance, internal audit, and an independent compensation consultant; 
​
➢
a mix of compensation elements that provide focus on both short- and long-term goals as well as cash and equity-based compensation so as not to inappropriately emphasize one measure of our performance; 
​
➢
caps on the maximum payouts available and minimum thresholds required before payment under certain incentive programs, including both short and long-term incentive plans; 
​
➢
performance goals within incentive programs that reference reportable, broad-based financial metrics; 
​
➢
setting performance goals that are intended to be challenging yet provide employees a reasonable opportunity to reach the threshold amount, while requiring meaningful performance to reach the target level and substantial performance to reach the maximum level; 
​
➢
equity compensation awards that may be earned or vest over a number of years ensuring that our executives' interests align with those of our stockholders over the long term; and 
​
➢
stock ownership guidelines that require our executive officers and directors to accumulate and maintain a significant ownership interest in the Company.
​
​
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
​
Our Code of Ethics, which is posted on our website at www.piedmontreit.com, prohibits directors and executive officers from engaging in transactions that may result in a conflict of interest with us. Our Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee review any transaction a director or executive officer proposes to have with us that could give rise to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, including any transaction that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. In conducting this review, these committees ensure that all such transactions are approved by a majority of the board of directors (including a majority of independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction and are fair and reasonable to us and on terms not less favorable to us than those available from unaffiliated third parties. No transaction has been entered into with any director or executive officer that does not comply with those policies and procedures. There were no related-party transactions since January 1, 2018 that would require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the board of directors of Piedmont, the Audit Committee's primary function is to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by overseeing the independent registered public accounting firm and reviewing the financial information to be provided to the stockholders and others, the system of internal control over financial reporting which management has established, and the audit and financial reporting process. The 2018 Audit Committee was composed of three independent directors and met seven times in fiscal year 2018. Management of Piedmont has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. Membership on the Audit Committee does not call for the professional training and technical skills generally associated with career professionals in the field of accounting and auditing. In addition, the independent registered public accounting firm devotes more time and has access to more information than does the Audit Committee. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's role does not provide any special assurances with regard to the financial statements of Piedmont, nor does it involve a professional evaluation of the quality of the audits performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
In this context, in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality and acceptability of the financial reporting and controls of Piedmont; the reasonableness of significant judgments; and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality and acceptability of the financial and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU, Section 380 as adopted by the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") in Rule 3200T, and other PCAOB standards, rules of the SEC, and other applicable regulations. The Audit Committee also received from and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB relating to that firm's independence from Piedmont and has discussed with that firm their independence. In addition, the Audit Committee considered the compatibility of non-audit services, if any, provided by the independent registered public accounting firm with the registered public accounting firm's independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for its audits. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the internal controls, and the overall quality of the financial reporting of Piedmont. 
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee approved the audited financial statements of Piedmont and recommended to the board of directors that they be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The board of directors approved the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
The 2018 Audit Committee Raymond G. Milnes, Jr. (Chairman)Kelly H. BarrettDale H. Taysom 
The Report of the Audit Committee to stockholders is not "soliciting material" and is not deemed "filed" with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference in any filing of Piedmont under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
In order to be eligible for presentation at our 2020 annual meeting, our Bylaws require that written notice of any director nominations or other stockholder proposals must be received by our Secretary no earlier than November 4, 2019 and no later than December 4, 2019 at the following address: Thomas A. McKean, Secretary, Piedmont Office 
Realty Trust, 5565 Glenridge Connector, Suite 450, Atlanta, GA 30342. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholder proposals submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by December 4, 2019.
​
HOUSEHOLDING
The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of disclosure documents. The rule allows us to send a single annual report, proxy statement, proxy statement combined with a prospectus, information statement, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family. This procedure is referred to as "Householding." This rule benefits both you and Piedmont. It reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps Piedmont reduce expenses. Each stockholder subject to Householding will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
If any stockholders in your household wish to receive a separate annual report, proxy statement, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, they may call us at 866-354-3485, write to us at Piedmont Shareowner Services at P.O. Box 30170, College Station, TX 77842-3170, or e-mail us at investor.services@piedmontreit.com. If you are a stockholder that receives multiple copies of our proxy materials or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, you may request Householding by contacting us in the same manner and requesting a householding consent.
​
OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this proxy statement, we know of no business that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than the items referred to herein. If any other matter is properly brought before the meeting for action by stockholders, proxies in the enclosed form returned to us will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the board of directors or, in the absence of such a recommendation, in accordance with the discretion of the proxy holder.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
We are providing you with this proxy statement, which contains information about the items to be voted upon at our Annual Meeting. To make this information easier to understand, we have presented some of the information below in a question and answer format. 
Q:
Will my vote make a difference? 
​
A:
Yes — YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Your vote is needed to ensure that the proposals can be acted upon. Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expenses associated with soliciting stockholder votes.
​
Q:
Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card? 
​
A:
You are receiving a proxy statement and proxy card from us because our board of directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement describes issues on which we would like you, as a stockholder, to vote. It also gives you information on these issues so that you can make an informed decision. 
​
When you vote using the Internet, by telephone, or by signing and returning the proxy card, you appoint Donald A. Miller, CFA, our Chief Executive Officer, and Robert E. Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. Messrs. Miller and Bowers will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them or if an issue that is not on the proxy card comes up for vote, in accordance with their discretion. This way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is a good idea to vote in advance of the Annual Meeting just in case your plans change. 
Q:
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a printed set of proxy materials? 
​
A:
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are permitted to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders by delivering a notice in the mail. If you received a notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the notice instructs you on how to access and review the proxy statement and annual report over the Internet at www.envisionreports.com/PDM. The notice also instructs you on how you may vote. If you received a notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you 
​
should follow the instructions for requesting these materials contained on the notice. 
Q:
When is the Annual Meeting and where will it be held? 
​
A:
The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, May  15, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern daylight time) at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta Perimeter at Villa Christina, 4000 Summit Boulevard, Atlanta, GA 30319. 
​
Q:
What is the record date? 
​

​
A:
As of the close of business on the record date, there were 125,595,994 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. Every stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. 
​
Q:
How many votes do you need to hold the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
In order for us to conduct the Annual Meeting, we must have a quorum, which means that a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date must be present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you: 
​
➢
vote over the Internet or by telephone; 
​
➢
properly submit a proxy card (even if you do not provide voting instructions); or 
​
➢
attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. 
​
As discussed below, shares which are counted as broker non-votes will also be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the Annual Meeting, it will be deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting (including any meeting resulting from any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting, unless a new record date is set).

​
A:
You are being asked to: 
​
(i)
elect nine directors to hold office for terms expiring at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; 
​
(ii)
ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019; 
​
(iii)
approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
​
No cumulative voting rights are authorized, and dissenter's rights are not applicable to the matters being voted upon. 
Q:
How do I vote if I am a registered stockholder? 
​
A:
If you are a registered stockholder, meaning that your shares are registered in your name, you have four voting options as described below: 
​
➢
You may vote by using the Internet. The address of the website for Internet voting can be found on your proxy card. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern daylight time on May 14, 2019. 
​
➢
You may vote by telephone. The toll-free telephone number can be found on your proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. Eastern daylight time on May 14, 2019. 
​
➢
You may vote by mail. If you choose to vote by mail, simply mark and sign your proxy card and return it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope. Voted proxy cards must be mailed and received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern daylight time on May 14, 2019 in order to be counted. 
​
➢
You may vote by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
​
If you have Internet access, we encourage you to record your vote on the Internet. It is convenient, and it saves us significant postage and processing costs. In addition, when you vote via the Internet or by phone prior to the meeting date, your vote is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your vote to arrive late and, therefore, not be counted. For further instructions on voting, see your enclosed proxy card in this proxy statement or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
Q:
Are voting procedures different if I hold my shares in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee? 
​
A:
If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, please refer to your proxy card or the instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other nominee regarding how to vote your shares or to revoke your voting instructions. The availability of telephone and Internet voting depends on the voting processes of the broker, bank or other nominee. 
​
Written ballots will be passed out to anyone who wants to vote at the Annual Meeting. However, if you hold your shares in street name, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee to be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Q:
What are broker non-votes? 
​
A:
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a beneficial owner fails to provide voting instructions to his or her broker as to how to vote shares held by the broker in street name and the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote without instructions. If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee and you do not provide voting instructions, your broker, bank or other nominee only has discretionary authority to vote your shares on your behalf for "routine" matters. The only "routine" matter being considered at the Annual Meeting is the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, brokers, banks and other nominees will have authority to vote their customers' shares with regard to that proposal (but not any other proposal) if their customers do not provide voting instructions. On "non-routine" matters, such as the election of directors and the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the named executive officers, brokers, banks and other nominees cannot vote their customers' shares without receiving voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares. 
​
Q:
How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted and what vote is required for each proposal? 
​
A:
The shares of a stockholder whose proxy on any or all proposals is marked as "abstain" will be included in the number of shares present at the annual meeting for the purpose of establishing the presence of a quorum. As described above, broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following table summarizes the voting requirement for each of the proposals under our By-Laws and the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on each proposal: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal Number  ​ ​  Item   ​ ​  Votes Required for Approval   ​ ​  Abstentions   ​ ​  Broker Non-Votes   ​ ​  Board Voting Recommendation   ​

[END TABLE]
(1)
A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted FOR a director must exceed the number of shares voted AGAINST that director for a nominee to be elected to that seat. In order to enhance your ability to influence the composition of the board of directors in an uncontested election, we have adopted a majority voting policy for the election of non-employee directors. The policy, which is part of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, sets forth our procedures if a nominee receives more "AGAINST" votes than "FOR" votes. In an uncontested election, any non-employee nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes against his or her election than votes for his or her election is required to promptly tender his or her resignation. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is required to promptly consider and make a recommendation to the board of directors with respect to the offer of resignation. The board is then required to take action with respect to this recommendation. Our majority voting policy is more fully described below under "Information Regarding the Board of Directors and Committees —  Majority Voting Policy."
​
Proxies that are properly executed and delivered, and not revoked, will be voted as specified on the proxy card. If you properly execute and deliver a proxy card or vote your shares via the internet but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted as listed in the "Board Voting Recommendation" column in the table above. 
Q:
What happens if a nominee is unable to serve if elected? 
​
A:
If a nominee is unable to serve if elected, the board of directors may reduce the number of directors that serve on the board or designate a substitute nominee. If the board of directors designates a substitute nominee, shares represented by proxies voted for the nominee who is unable to stand for election will be voted for the substitute nominee. In no event will more than nine directors be elected at the Annual Meeting. Neither our management nor our board of directors has any reason to believe that any nominee for election at the Annual Meeting will be unable to serve if elected, however. 
​
Q:
What if I vote and then change my mind? 
​
A:
If you are a registered stockholder, you have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before 11:59 p.m. Eastern daylight time on May 14, 2019 by: 
​
➢
voting again over the Internet or by telephone; 
​
➢
giving written notice to Thomas A. McKean, our Secretary; or 
​
➢
returning a new, valid proxy card bearing a later date, that is received before such time. 
​
You may also revoke your proxy by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
If you hold your shares in the name of a broker, bank, or other nominee, please refer to your broker's proxy card or instructions for the procedures you need to follow to revoke your vote. 
Q:
How will the proxies be voted? 
​
A:
Any proxy that is received in time, is properly signed and is not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions of the stockholder signing the proxy. If you return a signed proxy card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted FOR all of the ninenominees to serve on the board of directors; FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019; and FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the named executive officers. 
​
Q:
Is this proxy statement the only way that proxies are being solicited? 
​
A:
No. In addition to mailing proxy solicitation material, Georgeson, Inc. (our third party proxy solicitor) and our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, via the Internet, by telephone or by

Q:
