Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
You are cordially invited to attend our joint Annual Meetings of Shareholders at Mandarin Oriental Hotel – Ballroom Entrance, 66 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7LA, United Kingdom on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. The meetings will commence at 9:30 a.m., and although there are technically two separate meetings (the Carnival plc meeting will begin first), shareholders of Carnival Corporation may attend the Carnival plc meeting and vice-versa. We plan to continue to rotate the location of the Annual Meetings between the United Kingdom and the United States each year in order to accommodate shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic. 
We are also pleased to offer an audio replay of the business portion of the Annual Meetings, which will be available shortly after the meetings at www.carnivalcorp.com or www.carnivalplc.com. 
Details regarding the matters to be voted on are contained in the attached Notices of Annual Meetings of Shareholders and Proxy Statement. Because of the dual listed company arrangement, all voting will take place on a poll (or ballot). 
Your vote is important. We encourage you to vote as soon as possible to ensure your vote is recorded promptly, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meetings. 
The Boards of Directors recommend that you vote in favor of Proposals 1 through 20 and consider their approval to be in the best interests of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their shareholders. 
Thank you for your ongoing interest in, and continued support of, Carnival Corporation & plc.

ARNALDO PEREZ 
General Counsel & Secretary 
Carnival Corporation is continuing to take advantage of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules that allow it to deliver proxy materials over the Internet. Under these rules, Carnival Corporation is sending its shareholders a one-page notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials, unless they previously requested to receive printed copies. If you receive this one-page notice, you will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless you specifically request them. Instead, this notice tells you how to access and review on the Internet all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. This notice also tells you how to submit your proxy card on the Internet and how to request to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials. All Carnival Corporation shareholders are urged to follow the instructions in the notice and submit their votes using one of the voting methods described in the proxy materials. If you receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, the accompanying envelope for return of the proxy card requires no postage. Any shareholder attending the Annual Meetings in London may personally vote on all matters that are considered, in which event any previously submitted proxy will be revoked.

Voting Arrangements for Carnival plc Shareholders 
Carnival plc shareholders can vote in either of three ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person or, in the case of corporate shareholders, by corporate  representatives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by appointing a proxy to attend and vote on their behalf, using the proxy form enclosed with this Notice of Annual  General Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by voting electronically as described below.  
[END TABLE]
Voting in person 
If you come to the Annual General Meeting, please bring the attendance card (attached to the enclosed proxy form) with you. This will mean you can register more quickly. 
In order to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting, a corporate shareholder may appoint one or more individuals to act as its representative. The appointment must comply with the requirements of Section 323 of the Companies Act. Each representative should bring evidence of their appointment, including any authority under which it is signed, to the meeting. If you are a corporation and are considering appointing a corporate representative to represent you and vote your shareholding in Carnival plc at the Annual General Meeting, you are strongly encouraged to pre-register your corporate representative to make registration on the day of the meeting more efficient. In order to pre-register, please email your Letter of Representation to Carnival plc's registrars, Equiniti Limited, at proxyvotes@equiniti.com. 
Voting by proxy 
A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend, speak and vote in his or her stead. A proxy need not be a shareholder of Carnival plc. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. To appoint more than one proxy, please follow the notes contained in the proxy form. A person who is nominated to enjoy information rights in accordance with Section 146 of the Companies Act, but who is not a shareholder, is not entitled to appoint a proxy.

[END TABLE]
If you are a person nominated to enjoy information rights in accordance with Section 146 of the Companies Act you may have a right under an agreement between you and the member by whom you were nominated to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If you have no such right, or you have such a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. 
To be effective, a duly completed proxy form and the authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially certified copy of such authority, must be deposited (whether delivered personally or by post) at the offices of Carnival plc's registrars, Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing BN99 6DA, United Kingdom as soon as possible and in any event no later than 9:30 a.m. (BST) on April 12, 2019. Alternatively, a proxy vote may be submitted via the Internet in accordance with the instructions set out on the proxy form. 
In the case of joint registered holders, the signature of one holder on a proxy card will be accepted and the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which names stand on the register of shareholders of Carnival plc in respect of the relevant joint holding. 
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a "CREST Proxy Instruction") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual, which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
Carnival plc may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 
Voting electronically 
Shareholders are entitled to vote online at www.sharevote.co.uk. Shareholders voting electronically should vote as soon as possible, and in any event no later than 9:30 a.m. (BST) on April 12, 2019. 
Shareholders who are entitled to vote 
Carnival plc, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of Carnival plc at 6:30 p.m. (BST) on 
 April 12, 2019 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to the entries on the register of members after 6:30 p.m. (BST) on April 12, 2019 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. Carnival plc must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential  information;  
• the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or  
• it is undesirable in the interests of Carnival plc or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.   
[END TABLE]
Documents available for inspection 
Copies of all service agreements (including letters of appointment) between each Director and Carnival plc will be available for inspection during normal business hours on any weekday (public holidays excluded) at the registered office of Carnival plc from the date of this notice until and including the date of the meeting and at the place of the meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.

There are 20 Proposals that require shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting this year. The Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favor of Proposals 1 through 20 (inclusive). The Directors encourage you to submit your vote using one of the voting methods described herein. Submitting your voting instructions by any of these methods will not affect your right to attend the meeting in person should you so choose. 
Website materials 
This Proxy Statement and other information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act have been posted on our website at www.carnivalcorp.com and www.carnivalplc.com.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the audit of Carnival plc's accounts (including the auditor's report and the conduct of the audit) that are to  be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or  
• any circumstance connected with an auditor of Carnival plc ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which  annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Companies Act.  
[END TABLE]
Carnival plc may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act. Where Carnival plc is required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 of the Companies Act, it must forward the statement to Carnival plc's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that Carnival plc has been required under Section 527 of the Companies Act to publish on a website.

   GOVERNANCE   
   GOVERNANCE   
   GOVERNANCE   
[END TABLE]
We are committed to governance policies and practices so that shareholder and other stakeholder interests are represented in a thoughtful and independent manner. Sound principles of corporate governance are critical to obtaining and retaining the trust of investors. They are also vital in securing respect from other key stakeholders and interested parties, including our workforce, guests and suppliers, the communities in which we conduct business, government officials and the public-at-large. 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate under a dual listed company structure with primary stock listings in the United States ("U.S.") and the United Kingdom ("UK"). Accordingly, we have implemented a single corporate governance framework consistent, to the extent possible, with the governance practices and requirements of both countries. While there are customs or practices that differ between the two countries, we believe our corporate governance framework effectively addresses the corporate governance requirements of both the U.S. and the UK. 
Our corporate governance principles are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of our Board Committees. The actions described in these documents, which the Boards have reviewed and approved, implement applicable requirements, including the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements and, to the extent practicable, the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in April 2016 (the "UK Corporate Governance Code"), as well our own vision of good governance. 
We will continue to monitor governance developments in the U.S. and the UK to ensure a vigorous and effective corporate governance framework of the highest international standards. 
A new corporate governance code was published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in July 2018 (the "New UK Corporate Governance Code"). The New UK Corporate Governance Code only applies to financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2019. This means that the new requirements will apply to Carnival Corporation & plc for its fiscal year beginning December 1, 2019. We will continue to implement the systems and procedures that will need to be in place to ensure our compliance, to the extent practicable, with these requirements. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, copies of the charters of our Board Committees and our organizational documents are available under the "Governance" section of our website at www.carnivalcorp.com and www.carnivalplc.com. 
PROPOSALS 1-12 
ELECTION OR RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Boards are elected by the shareholders to exercise business judgment to act in what they reasonably believe to be in the best interests of Carnival Corporation & plc and its shareholders. The Boards select and oversee the members of senior management, who are charged by the Boards with conducting the business of the company. 
Nominations of Directors 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are two separate legal entities and, therefore, each has a separate Board of Directors, each of which in turn has its own Nominating & Governance Committee. As the dual listed company ("DLC") arrangement requires that there be identical Boards of Directors, the Nominating & Governance Committees make one set of determinations in relation to both companies.

GOVERNANCE 
Election or Re-Election of Directors 
The Nominating & Governance Committees actively seek individuals qualified to become Board members and recommend to the Boards the nominees to stand for election as Directors at the Annual Meetings of Shareholders or, if applicable, at a Special Meeting of Shareholders. 
When evaluating prospective candidates for Director, regardless of the source of the nomination, the Nominating & Governance Committees will consider, in accordance with their charters, such factors as they deem appropriate, including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's judgment;  
• the candidate's skill;  
• diversity considerations;  
• the candidate's experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size;  
• the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other members of the Boards; and   
• the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Boards and any Committees of the Boards.   
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines dictate that diversity should be considered by the Nominating & Governance Committees in the director identification and nomination process. This means that the Nominating & Governance Committees seek nominees who bring a variety of business backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to the Boards. The Boards believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of the Directors, considered as a group, should provide a broad diversity of experience, professions, skills, geographic representations, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Boards to fulfill their responsibilities and the Nominating & Governance Committees assess the effectiveness of this approach as part of the annual evaluations of our Boards of Directors. 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, 33% of the members of the Boards are women (being four of 12 members). 
The Nominating & Governance Committees will also use their best efforts to see that the composition of the Boards adheres to the independence requirements applicable to companies listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. The Nominating & Governance Committees and the Boards utilize the same criteria for evaluating candidates regardless of the source of the referral. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for Director nominees. 
The Nominating & Governance Committees identify nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Boards willing to continue in service. As part of director succession planning, current members of the Boards with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Boards with that of obtaining a new perspective. If any member of the Boards does not wish to continue in service or if the Nominating & Governance Committees or the Boards decide not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Nominating & Governance Committees identify the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Nominating & Governance Committees and the Boards are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria of the Nominating & Governance Committees. The Nominating & Governance Committees may consider candidates proposed by management, but are not required to do so. The Nominating & Governance Committees may engage a third party search firm to identify and attract potential nominees. In the case of Katie Lahey, several board members who interacted with her while she served as Executive Chair of Carnival Australia identified her as a potential board member. 
GOVERNANCE 
Election or Re-Election of Directors 
2019 Nominees for Election or Re-Election to the Boards 
The DLC arrangement requires the Boards of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc to be identical. Shareholders are required to approve the election or re-election of Directors to each Board. There are 12 nominees for election or re-election to each Board of Directors. Each nominee currently serves as a Director of both companies. All nominees for Director are to be elected or re-elected to serve until the next Annual Meeting and until their successors are elected. 
All of the nominees have indicated that they will be willing and able to serve as directors. 
With respect to each Board nominee set forth below, the information presented includes such person's age, the year in which such person first became a Director, any other position held with Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, such person's principal occupations during at least the past five years, any directorships held by such nominee in public or certain other companies over the past five years and the nominee's qualifications, including particular areas of expertise, to serve as a Director. 
The Nominating & Governance Committees conducted performance evaluations on the members of our Boards of Directors serving during fiscal 2018 and reported the results to the Boards. The Boards determined that each nominee was an effective and committed member of the Boards and the Board Committees on which each serves. In addition, in 2016, the Nominating & Governance Committees engaged a third-party governance expert to perform an assessment of the effectiveness of the Boards. The third-party governance expert interviewed each Director and members of senior management who interact substantially with the Boards, reviewed the results of the assessment with the Senior Independent Director, and then organized and summarized the assessment for discussion with the full Boards. 
Accordingly, the Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the election or re-election of each of the following Director nominees:

Board Meetings 
During the year ended November 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc held a total of six meetings. Each Carnival Corporation Director and each Carnival plc Director attended either telephonically or in person at least 75% of all Carnival Corporation & plc Board of Directors and applicable Board Committee meetings held during the period that he or she served in fiscal 2018. 
All Board members are expected to attend our Annual Meetings of Shareholders. At the 2018 Annual Meetings, all 11 incumbent Board members of each company were in attendance, except for Sir John Parker who missed due to illness. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Boards of Directors are led by our executive Chair, Mr. Arison. The Chief Executive Officer position is currently separate from the Chair. The Boards maintain the flexibility to determine whether the roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer should be combined or separated, based on what it believes is in the best interests of Carnival Corporation & plc at a given point in time. We believe that the separation of the Chair and Chief Executive Officer positions is appropriate corporate governance for us at this time, and that having Mr. Arison as our executive Chair enables Carnival Corporation & plc and the Boards to continue to benefit from Mr. Arison's skills and expertise, including his extensive knowledge of our business. 
Our Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are independent, meet privately in executive session at least quarterly. The Presiding Director leads those meetings and also acts as the Senior Independent Director under the UK Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Presiding Director serves as the principal liaison to the Non-Executive Directors, reviews and approves meeting agendas for the Boards and reviews meeting schedules. Our Non-Executive Directors, acting in executive session, elected Mr. Weisenburger in July 2017 as the Presiding Director and Senior Independent Director. 
GOVERNANCE 
Board and Committee Governance 
The structure of our Boards facilitates the continued strong communication and coordination between management and the Boards and enables the Boards to fulfill their risk oversight responsibilities, as further described below. 
Board Committees 
The Boards delegate various responsibilities and authority to different Board Committees. The Board Committees regularly report on their activities and actions to the full Boards. The Board of Directors of each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc has established standing Committees, which are each comprised of the same Directors for each company, as follows:

Board and Committee Governance 
Compensation Committees. The Compensation Committees have authority for reviewing and determining salaries, performance-based incentives, and other matters related to the compensation of our executive officers, and administering our stock incentive plans, including reviewing and granting equity-based grants to our executive officers and other employees. The Compensation Committees also review and determine various other compensation policies and matters, including making recommendations to the Boards with respect to the compensation of the Non-Executive(non-employee) Directors, incentive compensation and equity-based plans generally, and administering the employee stock purchase plans. For more information on the responsibilities and activities of the Compensation Committees, including the Committees' processes for determining executive compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation" sections and the Compensation Committees' charter. 
Executive Committees. The Executive Committees may exercise the authority of the full Boards between meetings of the Boards, except to the extent that the Boards have delegated authority to another Committee or to other persons, and except as limited by applicable law. 
HESS Committees. The HESS Committees review and recommend policies relative to the protection of the environment and the health, safety and security of employees, contractors, guests and the public. The HESS Committees also supervise and monitor health, environmental, safety, security and sustainability policies and programs and review with management significant risks or exposures and actions required to minimize such risks. For more information on the responsibilities and activities of the HESS Committees, see the HESS Committees' charter. 
Nominating & Governance Committees. The Nominating & Governance Committees review and report to the Boards on a periodic basis with regard to matters of corporate governance, including succession planning. The Nominating & Governance Committees also review and assess the effectiveness of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, make recommendations to the Boards regarding proposed revisions to these guidelines, and make recommendations to the Boards regarding the size and composition of the Boards and their Committees. For more information on the responsibilities and activities of the Nominating & Governance Committees, see "Nominations of Directors" and "Procedures Regarding Director Candidates Recommended by Shareholders" sections and the Nominating & Governance Committees' charter. Additional information with respect to Carnival plc's corporate governance practices during fiscal 2018 is included in the Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report attached as Annex C to this Proxy Statement. 
Board and Committee Independence 
Under New York Stock Exchange standards of independence for directors, the Board must determine that a Director does not have any material relationship with Carnival Corporation & plc or its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Carnival Corporation & plc) and meet certain bright-line tests. The Boards of Directors have determined that each of Sir Jonathon Band, Jason Glen Cahilly, Helen Deeble, Richard J. Glasier, Debra Kelly-Ennis, Katie Lahey, Sir John Parker, Stuart Subotnick, Laura Weil and Randall J. Weisenburger is an "independent director" in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange standards of independence for directors and that all members of the Audit Committees and Compensation Committees meet the heightened independence criteria applicable to Directors serving on those Committees under SEC rules and New York Stock Exchange listing standards. Accordingly, a majority of the Directors of each company, all of our Non-Executive Directors and all of the members of the Audit Committees, Compensation Committees, HESS Committees and Nominating & Governance Committees of each company are independent (as defined by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, SEC rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code).

Board and Committee Governance 
Risk Oversight 
Our Boards use their Committees to assist in their risk oversight function as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Audit Committees are responsible for oversight of our financial, operational and  non-HESS controls and compliance activities, including those related to information technology operations, cybersecurity and privacy. In connection with its risk oversight role, the Audit Committees regularly  meet privately with representatives from Carnival Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, the Carnival plc independent auditor, the Chief Audit Officer and the General Counsel.  
• Our Compensation Committees are responsible for oversight of risk associated with our executive compensation structure,  policies and programs.  
• Our HESS Committees are responsible for oversight of risk associated with the health, environment, safety and security  of employees, contractors, guests and the public.  
• Our Nominating & Governance Committees are responsible for oversight of risk associated with Board processes  and corporate governance, including succession planning.  
[END TABLE]
Each Committee Chair presents on its area of risk oversight to the full Boards for review. 
Discussions between management and the Boards regarding the Carnival Corporation & plc strategic plan, consolidated business results, capital structure, and other business-related activities include a discussion of the risks associated with the particular item under consideration. 
The Boards believe that the structure and assigned responsibilities provides the appropriate focus, oversight and communication of principal risks faced by our companies. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
Carnival Corporation & plc's management, in conjunction with the Compensation Committees' independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), conducted a thorough review of our compensation programs, including those programs in which our Named Executive Officers participate, to determine if aspects of those programs contribute to excessive risk-taking. Based on the findings from this review and the annual reassessment, the Compensation Committees continue to believe that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Carnival Corporation & plc. 
To reach this conclusion, key elements of our compensation programs were assessed to determine if they exhibited excessive risk. These elements included pay mix (cash vs. equity) and pay structure (short vs. long-term focus), performance metrics, performance goals and ranges, the degree of leverage, incentive maximums, payment timing, incentive adjustments, use of discretion and stock ownership requirements. Our assessment reinforced the Compensation Committees' belief that our compensation programs are not contributing to excessive risk-taking, but instead contain many features and elements that help to mitigate risk. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay Structure. Our compensation programs emphasize both short and long-term  performance through our annual bonus program (delivered in cash) and through the delivery of long-term incentives (equity) in a balanced approach (approximately 46% through base salary and bonus and 54% in long-term equity grants). The mix of our  pay program is intended to motivate management to consider the impact of decisions on shareholders in the short, intermediate and long-term.  
• Incentive Limits. Our annual bonus plans do not allow for unlimited payouts. Bonuses  cannot exceed 200% of target levels. The performance-based share grants made in fiscal 2018 limit the

   payouts to 200% (in the case of PBS and MTE grants as described below) or 600% (in the case of SEA grants as described below) of  target.  
• Performance-Based Share Grants. To strengthen the relationship between pay and  performance, all of our equity grants to senior executives for fiscal 2018 service have been in the form of performance-based share grants.  
• Performance Measurement. For corporate officers, the performance measurement used  when determining their annual bonus is based on the performance of Carnival Corporation & plc. For officers of our operating units, the performance measurements used when determining their bonus is based 50% on the performance of their  operating unit, with the remaining balance being based on the performance of Carnival Corporation & plc to enable a continued focus on the overall success of Carnival Corporation & plc.  
• Stock Ownership Policy. All senior executives who are designated as reporting  officers under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including our Named Executive Officers, are subject to a stock ownership policy which specifies target ownership levels of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc shares in terms of the value of the  equity holdings as a multiple of each officer's base salary.  
• Clawback Policy. The Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan (which was approved by  shareholders in 2011), the Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan (which was approved by shareholders in 2014) and the incentive plan used to determine annual bonuses contain clawback provisions, which authorize us to recover incentive-based  compensation granted under those plans in the event Carnival Corporation & plc is required to restate their financial statements due to fraud or misconduct.

Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines address various governance issues and principles, including Director qualifications and responsibilities, access to management personnel, Director compensation, Director orientation and continuing education and annual performance evaluations of the Boards, their Committees and individual Directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are posted on our website at www.carnivalcorp.com and www.carnivalplc.com. 
Chief Executive Officer Succession Planning 
Our Boards believe that planning for the succession of our Chief Executive Officer is an important function. Our multi-brand structure enhances our succession planning process. At the corporate level, a highly-skilled management team oversees a collection of cruise brands. At both the corporate and brand levels, we continually strive to foster the professional development of senior management. As a result, Carnival Corporation & plc has developed a very experienced and strong group of leaders, with their performance subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, as potential successors to all of our senior executive positions, including our Chief Executive Officer. 
The Boards and the Nominating & Governance Committees are responsible for succession planning, including emergency succession planning. The independent Non-Executive Directors meet with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (both together and individually) at least quarterly to plan for the succession of the Chief Executive Officer, including plans in the event of an emergency. During those sessions, each of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer discusses his recommendations of potential successors, along with an evaluation and review of any development plans for such individuals. As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating & Governance Committees will, when appropriate, make recommendations to the Boards with respect to potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer. All members of the Boards will work with the Nominating & Governance Committees to see that qualified candidates are available and that development plans are

Board and Committee Governance being utilized to strengthen the skills and qualifications of the candidates. When assessing the qualifications of potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer, the Boards and the Nominating & Governance Committees will take into account our business strategy as well as any other criteria they believe are relevant. 
Procedures Regarding Director Candidates Recommended by Shareholders 
The Nominating & Governance Committees will also consider shareholder recommendations of qualified Director nominees when such recommendations are submitted in accordance with the procedures below. In order to recommend a candidate for consideration by the Nominating & Governance Committees for election at the 2019 Annual Meetings, a shareholder must provide the same information as is required for shareholders to submit Director nominations under the advance notice provision set forth in Carnival Corporation's By-laws. Specifically, any such recommendation must include, in addition to any other informational requirements specifically set forth in Carnival Corporation's and Carnival plc's governing documents: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name and address of the candidate;  
• a brief biographical description, including his or her occupation and service on Boards of Directors of any public  company or registered investment company for at least the last five years;  
• a statement of the particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of the candidate, taking into account the  qualification requirements set forth above; and  
• the candidate's signed consent to serve as a Director if elected and to be named in the Proxy Statement.   
[END TABLE]
Once we receive the recommendation, we may deliver to the candidate a questionnaire that requests additional information about the candidate's independence, qualifications and other matters that would assist the Nominating & Governance Committees in evaluating the candidate, as well as certain information that must be disclosed about the candidate in our Proxy Statement or other regulatory filings, if nominated. Candidates must complete and return the questionnaire within the time frame provided to be considered for nomination by the Nominating & Governance Committees at the Annual Meetings. For our 2020 Annual Meetings of Shareholders, the Nominating & Governance Committees will consider recommendations received by our Secretary at our headquarters no later than November 8, 2019. 
Communications between Shareholders or Interested Parties and the Boards 
Shareholders or interested parties who wish to communicate with the Boards, the Presiding Director, the Non-Executive Directors as a group or any individual Director should address their communications to the attention of the Secretary of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc at 3655 N.W. 87th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33178 U.S.A. The Secretary will maintain a log of all such communications, promptly forward to the Presiding Director those which the Secretary believes require immediate attention, and also periodically provide the Presiding Director with a summary of all such communications and any responsive actions taken. The Presiding Director will notify the Boards or the Chairs of the relevant Board Committees as to those matters that he believes are appropriate for further action or discussion.

Non-Executive Directors receive annual restricted share grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan. In April 2018, the Non-Executive Directors received grants with a dollar value equal to approximately $175,000. As a result, a grant of 2,749 Carnival Corporation restricted shares was made to each Non-Executive Director elected or re-elected on April 11, 2018 based on the closing price of a share on that date of $63.64. 
Grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan are released from restriction on the third anniversary of the grant date (and are not forfeitable provided the Director has served at least a full year). Grants of restricted shares have the same rights with respect to dividends and other distributions as all other outstanding shares of Carnival Corporation common stock. Generally, Non-Executive Directors will receive their annual grants initially upon their election to the Boards and subsequently at the time of their annual re-election to the Boards.

The following policies also apply to our Non-Executive Directors:

• Stock Ownership Policy. The stock ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors provides that all Non-Executive Directors are required to own shares (inclusive of unvested restricted shares, restricted stock units  ("RSUs") and shares in a trust beneficially owned by the Director) of either Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares with a value equal to a multiple of the cash retainer. During fiscal 2018, the Board increased  the target ownership level from four times the cash retainer to five times the cash retainer. New Directors must achieve this requirement no later than five years from the date of their initial election to the Boards by the shareholders. Other than  Ms. Deeble and Mr. Cahilly who were initially elected at the 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, respectively, and Ms. Lahey, who was appointed to the Boards in January 2019 and is proposed for election at the 2019 Annual Meetings, each of  the Non-Executive Directors elected has achieved this Board-mandated requirement.  
• Product Familiarization. All Non-Executive  Directors are encouraged to take a cruise(s) for up to a total of 14 days per year for product familiarization and pay a fare of $35 per person per day for such cruises (or $50 per day in the case of Seabourn), plus taxes, fees and port expenses.  All other charges associated with the cruise (e.g., air, ground transfers, gratuities, tours and fuel supplements, if any) are the responsibility of the Non-Executive Director.

• a Services Agreement with AFO, LLC (the "Services Agreement" and together with the Services Agreement, the  "Aircraft Agreements").  
[END TABLE]
Both AD Astra I, LLC and AFO, LLC are companies directly or indirectly controlled by a trust of which Mr. Arison is a beneficiary. 
Under the terms of the Lease Agreement, Carnival Corporation leases an aircraft beneficially owned by AD Astra I, LLC for additional flight capacity from time-to-time in exchange for an hourly rent of $4,500 plus applicable taxes, which is based on market charter rates for similar aircraft as adjusted for costs of operations borne by Carnival Corporation (i.e., fuel, crew costs and line maintenance during its operation of the aircraft) and hourly service plan expenses. 
Under the terms of the Service Agreement, Carnival Corporation provides aircraft management services to AFO, LLC with respect to the aircraft, including overseeing its operation, maintenance, and staffing, and is paid an annual fee of $216,000 (which is based on market rates for similar arrangements) (the "Service Fee"). In addition, Carnival Corporation will be reimbursed for operating, maintenance and personnel costs and related third party costs incurred in connection with the services ("Service Costs"). The terms of the Aircraft Agreements are one year and renew automatically for one-year periods, unless terminated sooner by either party upon 30 days' written notice. 
During fiscal 2018, Carnival Corporation paid AD Astra I, LLC $789,000 under the Lease Agreement, and AFO, LLC paid Carnival Corporation $216,000 for the Service Fee and reimbursed Carnival Corporation $1,733,000 for the Service Costs. 
The Boards have reviewed and approved or ratified these transactions.

PROPOSAL 13 
ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our shareholders are being provided with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve our executive compensation. We refer to this vote as the "say-on-pay" vote. Although this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Boards, the Compensation Committees will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
The "say-on-pay" vote is required to be offered to our shareholders at least once every three years. In 2017, our Boards recommended that we provide shareholders with the opportunity to cast their "say-on-pay" vote each year and our shareholders agreed. As a result, the next "say-on-pay" vote is expected to occur at the 2020 Annual Meetings. 
The Boards are committed to corporate governance best practices and recognize the significant interest of shareholders in executive compensation matters. The Compensation Committees seek to balance short-term and long-term compensation opportunities to enable Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc to meet short-term objectives while continuing to produce value for their shareholders over the long-term. They also promote a compensation program designed to attract, motivate and retain key executives. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committees believe that our current executive compensation program directly links executive compensation to our performance and aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation philosophy places more emphasis on variable elements of compensation (such as annual bonuses and  equity-based compensation) than fixed remuneration.  
• In accordance with the Compensation Committees' focus on long-term shareholder return, they approved  performance-based share grants for our Named Executive Officers which vest based upon the extent to which certain pre-grant or post-grant performance criterion are attained. These grants also have maximum  payout limitations. Performance criterion may include annual operating income, return on invested capital ("ROIC"), absolute total shareholder return ("TSR") and/or TSR rank relative to the Peer Group (defined below).   
• To further promote long-term shareholder alignment, we require our Named Executive Officers to meet and maintain stock  ownership requirements.  
• The Compensation Committees review the position of each element of total direct compensation relative to the competitive  market, and use the range of total direct compensation levels in the competitive market to assess the extent to which the compensation provided to our Named Executive Officers is generally consistent with that offered by the competitive market to  their named executive officers.  
• Carnival Corporation & plc does not offer U.S. executives excise tax  gross-up protections.  
[END TABLE]
We encourage you to read our Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained within this Proxy Statement for a more detailed discussion of our compensation policies and procedures. 
Our shareholders have the opportunity to vote for or against, or to abstain from voting on, the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement)." 
COMPENSATION 
Approval of Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR approval of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement). 
PROPOSAL 14 
APPROVAL OF CARNIVAL PLC DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT 
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the "LMCG Regulations"), shareholders are voting to approve adoption of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. The Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is in two parts. Part I also constitutes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as required by regulations promulgated by the SEC, and includes information that Carnival plc is required to disclose in accordance with the LMCG Regulations. Part II of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is set forth as Annex B to this Proxy Statement and includes the additional information that Carnival plc is required to disclose in accordance with the LMCG Regulations, including certain information which has been audited for the purposes of the Carnival plc Annual Report. 
UK law only requires an advisory vote on the substance and content of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. Accordingly, disapproval of this Proposal 14 will not require us to amend the report or require any Director to repay any amount. However, the Boards and Compensation Committees are expected to take into account both the voting result and the views of our shareholders in their application, development and implementation of remuneration policies and plans. 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the approval of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
and 
CARNIVAL PLC DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT – PART I 
Introduction 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are separate legal entities (together referred to in this Report as "Carnival Corporation & plc") and each company has its own Board of Directors and Compensation Committee. However, as is required by the agreements governing the DLC arrangement, the Boards of Directors and members of the Committees of the Boards, including the Compensation Committees, are identical and there is a single senior management team. 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are subject to disclosure regimes in the U.S. and UK. While some of the disclosure requirements are the same or similar, some are very different. As a result, the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is in two parts. The information contained in this Part I constitutes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as required by regulations promulgated by the SEC, and includes information that Carnival plc is required to disclose in accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the "LMCG Regulations"). Part II of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is set forth as Annex B to this Proxy Statement and includes the additional information that Carnival plc is required to disclose in accordance with the LMCG Regulations, including certain information that has been audited for the purposes of the Carnival plc Annual Report.

Our executive compensation program is designed to reward financial results and effective strategic leadership through use of both short-term rewards and long-term incentives and to promote alignment of the financial interests of our executive officers with our shareholders. We seek to provide total direct compensation (salary, bonus and equity grants) that allows us to be competitive in the labor markets where we compete for executive talent, adjusted as necessary to take into consideration factors including the senior executive's performance, experience and responsibilities. We believe our compensation program's performance measures align the interests of our shareholders and senior executives by linking actual pay to operating performance and shareholder outcomes. 
Our compensation philosophy has historically been to emphasize at risk incentive pay in order to drive a pay-for-performance culture. In furtherance of this philosophy, all direct compensation for our Named Executive Officers, other than base salary, is 100% at risk and performance-based. 
Most of our executive officers are located in the U.S., with others based in Europe. As a global entity, it is challenging to establish consistent compensation practices across geographic and operating company units that satisfy the particular requirements of all jurisdictions and local market demands. Since the largest presence of executive officers is in the U.S., our compensation policies primarily reflect U.S. market practices. However, the Compensation Committees seek to incorporate UK compensation principles, including those contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code, to the degree practicable.

Shareholder Engagement 
Carnival Corporation & plc has a long-standing shareholder outreach program and routinely interacts with shareholders on a number of matters, including executive compensation. The Compensation Committees consider all feedback received about executive compensation. 
In April 2018, shareholders approved our "say-on-pay" proposal with 92.4% of the votes cast in favor of the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. During the past year, we have continued to engage with shareholders and seek feedback on our compensation program and incorporate the results of that feedback in our compensation decisions. As a result, the Compensation Committees did not make any changes to the executive compensation program specifically as a result of the 2018 "say-on-pay" vote. 
The Compensation Committees have and will continue to consider results from the annual shareholder advisory votes, including the next vote in April 2019, as well as other shareholder input, when reviewing executive compensation programs and policies.

Process for Making Compensation Determinations 
The Compensation Committees determine the compensation policy and the compensation payable to all of our executive officers. The Compensation Committees interact with the management of Carnival Corporation & plc on compensation issues primarily through communications, meetings and discussions with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Boards of Directors and the Chief Human Resources Officer, who also attend meetings of the Compensation Committees as requested by the Compensation Committees. As part of the fiscal 2018 annual compensation determination process, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors recommended to the Compensation Committees key initiatives and goals for Carnival Corporation & plc at the beginning of the fiscal year. After the fiscal year was completed, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors reviewed with the Compensation Committees the results of those initiatives, progress towards goals and other material items relating to overall Carnival Corporation & plc performance. The Chief Executive Officer reviewed the annual competitive market analysis provided by the independent consultant, as well as individual performance of each Named Executive Officer and the results of the group of brands or company-wide results, as appropriate, and provided the Compensation Committees with recommended total target compensation levels for each Named Executive Officer, except for his own. The compensation for our Named Executive Officers' was then determined by the Compensation Committees using their discretion to evaluate the individual performance of our Named Executive Officers and the overall performance of Carnival Corporation & plc. 
The Compensation Committees believe that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behavior, and that risks arising from Carnival Corporation & plc's compensation policies and practices for their workforce are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Carnival Corporation & plc. Please refer to the "Compensation Risk Assessment" section for additional information. 
Independent Compensation Consultants. The Compensation Committees have engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") (together with its UK affiliated firm, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP ("FIT")) to assist in their annual review of our executive and Director compensation programs. The Compensation Committees believe that FW Cook and FIT provided objective advice to the Compensation Committees. FW Cook and FIT provide no other services to Carnival Corporation & plc. 
During fiscal 2018, a consultant from FW Cook attended meetings of the Compensation Committees and provided FW Cook's views on proposed actions by the Compensation Committees. 
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committees also engaged Willis Towers Watson ("WTW") to assist the Compensation Committees with the CEO Pay Ratio calculation and disclosure. 
In accordance with the New York Stock Exchange rules relating to compensation consultant independence, the Compensation Committees have determined that FW Cook, FIT and WTW and their consultants are independent after taking into consideration the factors set forth in the New York Stock Exchange rules. Pursuant to the foregoing factors, the Compensation Committees have determined that FW Cook's, FIT's and WTW's work raised no conflicts of interest. 
Peer Group Characteristics. The Compensation Committees perform an annual review of the compensation practices of certain other publicly-listed companies with the assistance of their consultant. This annual market assessment consists of an analysis of executive pay at a group of publicly-listed peer companies. 
The peer group listed below (the "Peer Group") was used when assessing the fiscal 2018 compensation for our Named Executive Officers, which was unchanged from the peer group developed

in October 2016 (except for the removal of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. as a result of its acquisition by Marriott International, Inc.). The Peer Group consists of 19 publicly-listed companies from diverse industries that exhibit similar size and business characteristics with Carnival Corporation & plc and reflect the market in which we may compete for business, investor capital and/or executive talent. The Peer Group reflects a balanced group of companies in the consumer discretionary sector, including media, retailing, services and transportation companies.

These analyses suggest that, in the aggregate, total direct compensation levels for our Named Executive Officers are competitively positioned. The Compensation Committees, as advised by FW Cook, consider total direct compensation to be generally competitive when within a range of 15% above or below the market median. Actual pay positioning can vary based on factors including job responsibilities, experience, impact of role and individual performance. 
Consistent with the approach that the Compensation Committees take in reviewing each element of total direct compensation, the Compensation Committees utilize these analyses to assess the extent to which the compensation provided to our Named Executive Officers is generally consistent with that offered by companies with whom Carnival Corporation & plc competes for executive level talent. The Compensation Committees do not use these analyses to peg any particular element of compensation (or total compensation) to any specific targeted Peer Group level. 
Named Executive Officer Compensation Design, Elements and Pay Mix 
The compensation elements for our Named Executive Officers consist of base salary, an annual bonus, equity-based compensation, retirement benefits and perquisites. 
The compensation practices for each of our Named Executive Officers vary in order to reflect the organizational structure of Carnival Corporation & plc. Three of our Named Executive Officers (Messrs.

In determining the amount of any particular compensation element, the Compensation Committees consider the impact of such an element on total compensation (and thus, each element affects the amount paid in respect of other elements of compensation). For example, the Compensation Committees consider the amount of the base salary and annual bonus that may be earned by a Named Executive Officer when making an equity grant. However, the annual bonus and equity-based compensation grants are set independently on the basis of dollar values (and are not set or determined as a fixed percentage of base salary). 
As reflected in our target pay mix below, all direct compensation of our Named Executive Officers, other than base salary, is 100% at risk and performance-based in line with our philosophy to place greater emphasis on performance-based pay elements.

2018 Compensation Recommendations and Rationale 
As previously disclosed, the Compensation Committees undertook a fundamental restructuring of the compensation program for the Named Executive Officers in 2017. The restructured program, which strengthened the performance-based focus of compensation to our Named Executive Officers and enhanced the alignment between executive rewards and long-term gains for Carnival Corporation & plc and its shareholders, was continued for fiscal 2018. This compensation structure consists of base

salary, performance-based annual bonus and three performance-based equity components tied to achievement of business objectives and total shareholder return. Therefore, every component of the compensation program, with the exception of base salary, is performance-based and at risk. This compensation philosophy continues to extend beyond our Named Executive Officers to include other key executives, reflecting the Compensation Committees' commitment to aligning compensation with the success of Carnival Corporation & plc.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report—Part I 
Please refer to the following discussion and the "Compensation Tables" section for additional information on total direct compensation. 
Base Salaries 
Base salaries are intended to provide a level of fixed compensation that is reflective of each Named Executive Officer's level of responsibility. Base salaries of our Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018 are reported in the "Summary Compensation Table." The Compensation Committees annually review each Named Executive Officer's performance and may increase the base salary of a Named Executive Officer at their discretion if merited by performance or other market factors necessary to attract and retain our executives. 
Salaries for fiscal 2018 were established for our Named Executive Officers in January 2018 after performance results for the prior fiscal year were available. There was no increase in the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018. 
Annual Bonuses 
In fiscal 2018, each Named Executive Officer's target bonus comprised a significant portion of their respective total cash compensation opportunity, supporting Carnival Corporation & plc's objective to emphasize pay for performance. Annual bonus payments are intended to reward short-term individual, corporate, and a group of brands' performance results and achievements. The emphasis on the annual bonus as compared to base salary allows Carnival Corporation & plc to more closely link financial results to individual and overall company performance. Fiscal 2018 bonuses for our Named Executive Officers are reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" under the column labeled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." 
For fiscal 2018, the annual bonuses for our Named Executive Officers were determined in accordance with the Carnival Corporation & plc Management Incentive Plan (the "Management Incentive Plan") described below. 
The Management Incentive Plan is designed to focus the attention of our executives, including our Named Executive Officers, on achieving outstanding performance results as reflected by income from the operations of Carnival Corporation & plc as well as other relevant measures. For the Named Executive Officers who are Chief Executive Officers of a group of brands, the Management Incentive Plan is designed to also focus their attention on achieving outstanding performance results as reflected in the operating income of the group of brands they oversee. 
Under the Management Incentive Plan, the Corporation Operating Income Target, Brand Operating Income Target and target bonus for each executive are established by the Compensation Committees for each plan year. The respective operating income targets are the adjusted U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles net income of Carnival Corporation & plc, or the respective brand (or group of brands), excluding interest income and expense, other nonoperating income and expense, and income taxes, as reported by Carnival Corporation & plc, or the respective brand (or group of brands), as applicable, for the plan year. 
The "Corporation Operating Income Target" and "Brand Operating Income Target" for each year is established by the Compensation Committees taking into account historical performance, company/industry growth, Carnival Corporation & plc's annual plan, consultation with management, investor guidance (as to the Corporation Operating Income Target), the brand's annual plan (as to the Brand Operating Income Target) and such other factors as the Compensation Committees deem appropriate. In order to measure management's controllable operating contribution to the company, the Corporation and Brand Operating Income Targets and the actual Corporation and Brand Operating Income

achieved for fiscal 2018 were measured using a constant fuel price per ton and constant currency exchange rates. 
In January 2018, the Compensation Committees set the Corporation Operating Income Target for fiscal 2018 at $3.335 billion, which was 7.2% more than the actual Corporation Operating Income achieved in fiscal 2017 when normalized for fuel price and currency exchange rate impact, consistent with historical methodology. The Compensation Committees believed that this target represented a challenging performance goal. 
Under the Management Incentive Plan, the preliminary bonus amounts payable were dependent upon the amount of Corporation Operating Income achieved as compared to the Corporation Operating Income Target as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporation Operating Income (in billions)     Performance Level (% of Target Achievement)     Payout     Percentage(1)       
 Corporation Operating Income (in billions)     Performance Level (% of Target Achievement)     Payout     Percentage(1)

   $3.565    Maximum (106.9%)    200.0% 
(1)  The payout curve includes four linear slopes. Payouts between these points are calculated using interpolation.

Bonus funding under the Management Incentive Plan for the Named Executive Officers who are Chief Executive Officers of a group of brands was calculated by reference to a bonus schedule that calibrates the respective weighted Brand Operating Income Target of 50% (proportionally weighted by the size of each brand, when more than one brand is under the scope of the Named Executive Officer) and Corporation Operating Income Target of 50% for the fiscal 2018 plan year with the target bonus. 
The Compensation Committees considered the attainment of each brand's Brand Operating Income Target for fiscal 2018 to be achievable but challenging given each brand's fiscal 2017 performance. 
The fiscal 2018 Brand Operating Income Target for the Holland America Group and Carnival UK (both applicable to Mr. Kruse) were 9.8% and 11.3%, respectively, and the Costa Group (applicable to Mr. Thamm) was 11.1% more than the actual Brand Operating Income achieved in fiscal 2017 when normalized for fuel price and currency exchange rate impact. The Compensation Committees believed that these targets represented challenging performance goals and were both higher than the normalized actual results for fiscal 2017. 
In January 2018, Mr. Donald provided the Compensation Committees with his recommendations regarding the fiscal 2018 target bonus amounts under the Management Incentive Plan for our Named Executive Officers (other than himself), in which there was no increase from their fiscal 2017 target bonuses. The Compensation Committees accepted Mr. Donald's recommendations. The fiscal 2018 target bonuses were, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Arnaldo Perez        $   450,000

These amounts were established by the Compensation Committees after taking into consideration the competitive market analysis (described above), historical bonus payout levels, the challenging

Corporation Operating Income Target established by the Compensation Committees for fiscal 2018 and the Compensation Committees' continued philosophy to place emphasis on performance-based pay elements. 
Following the end of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committees reviewed actual Corporation Operating Income and Brand Operating Income results achieved during fiscal 2018, inclusive of adjustments deemed relevant to the performance of Carnival Corporation & plc and the individual brands, under the terms of the Management Incentive Plan. 
After taking these adjustments into consideration, the Compensation Committees certified an adjusted Corporation Operating Income amount for fiscal 2018 that was 103.8% of the fiscal 2018 Corporation Operating Income Target and resulted in a preliminary bonus funding. 
One factor further modifying the bonus funding percentage was our HESS performance, as determined by the HESS Committees. To make this annual determination, the HESS Committees met regularly with members of the Carnival Corporation & plc Maritime Policy & Analysis Department and senior management to review an extensive analysis of each brand's and Carnival Corporation & plc's enterprise-wide performance in HESS-related areas tracked throughout the course of the fiscal year. When applied, the result was a preliminary funding Based on the Corporation's 2018 results and the HESS modifier recommended by the HESS Committees, the Compensation Committees approved to the bonus funding equal to equal to 156.3% of Messrs. Donald, Bernstein and Perez's target bonus. 
The adjusted Corporation Operating Income, performance levels and resulting actual performance level payouts for fiscal 2018 as approved by the Compensation Committees were as follows:

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committees also certified an adjusted Brand Operating Income amount for the Holland America Group, Carnival UK and Costa Group for fiscal 2018 that were 103.5%, 108.3% and 100.5% of their respective 2018 Brand Operating Income Targets. Based on these 2018 brand results, their respective HESS modifiers recommended by the HESS Committees, and the adjusted Corporate Operating Income results described above, the result was bonus funding for Messrs. Kruse and Thamm, equal to 150.7% and 132.6% of their respective target bonuses. 
Mr. Donald made recommendations to the Compensation Committees for all Named Executive Officer annual bonuses except for his own. The recommendations included a subjective review of the applicable fiscal year overall performance of each Named Executive Officer. Mr. Donald also submitted his self-assessments to the Compensation Committees summarizing his own activities and results as compared to his goals, as well as Carnival Corporation & plc's overall performance. 
Final bonus amounts were then determined by the Compensation Committees, taking into account Mr. Donald's recommendations and input from FW Cook. In making their determinations, including whether to vary bonuses from the amount determined under the bonus schedule included in the Management Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committees considered the factors summarized in the "Executive Summary" section above, in addition to the competitive market compensation for each Named Executive Officer and their subjective overall assessment of individual performance in fiscal 2018. After taking into account the factors referred to above, together with an assessment of the individual performance of each of the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committees determined not to vary the final bonus amounts determined by the bonus schedule in the Management

Equity-Based Compensation 
A.    General 
The Compensation Committees grant equity-based compensation to our Named Executive Officers to provide long-term incentives and align management and shareholder interests. The Compensation Committees believe that a substantial portion of compensation should be equity-based. The equity-based compensation program is designed to recognize scope of responsibilities, reward demonstrated performance and leadership, motivate future superior performance and align the interests of the executive with our shareholders. To further augment these views the equity program for fiscal 2018 was 100% performance-based for our Named Executive Officers and other key executives within Carnival Corporation & plc. For fiscal 2018, this includes three different types of performance-based equity grants: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management Incentive Plan-Tied Equity ("MTE") grants;  
• Performance-Based Share ("PBS") grants; and  
• Shareholder Equity Alignment ("SEA") grants.  
[END TABLE]
These equity grants provide for performance-based vesting or granting criteria and align our senior management team's long-term compensation opportunities with Carnival Corporation & plc's long-term performance. In addition, the value of these equity grants serve to link pay and performance in two ways: they have pre- or post-grant performance criteria to determine the number of shares earned and the value of the shares earned appreciate or depreciate based on the trading price of our shares. 
Our equity-based compensation grants are made pursuant to the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan or the Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan, which have been approved by Carnival Corporation & plc's shareholders. Messrs. Donald, Bernstein, Kruse and Perez received equity grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan. Mr. Thamm received equity grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan and the Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan. 
The specific equity grants made to our Named Executive Officers reflect the desire of the Compensation Committees to link this compensation to performance. The number and form of equity grants made annually to our Named Executive Officers are determined both in the discretion of the Compensation Committees and pursuant to certain agreements with certain Named Executive Officers. Existing ownership levels are not a factor in grant determinations, as the Compensation Committees do not want to discourage executives from holding significant amounts of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc shares. 
The value of equity grants made to our Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Donald was determined by the Compensation Committees after reviewing the recommendation of Mr. Donald and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors and the other elements of the Named Executive Officer's current year compensation, taking into account the position and role of the Named Executive Officer, the individual performance in the preceding fiscal year and historically, and the perceived future value to Carnival Corporation & plc. When reviewing the competitive market assessment provided by FW Cook for total direct compensation, the Compensation Committees also evaluated the long-term and short-term incentive compensation components to confirm that the value of a Named Executive Officer's aggregate equity-based compensation and total direct compensation remains generally competitive. Similar to the approach taken for the other Named Executive Officers, the value of equity grants made to Mr. Donald was determined by the Compensation Committees after consultation with FW Cook, taking into account his position and role, his individual performance, perceived future value and competitive market position.

B.    Disclosure and the Timing of Equity-Based Compensation 
The Compensation Committees met in January 2018 to determine the target values of the MTE grants, in February 2018 to determine the PBS grants and in April 2018 to determine the SEA grants, all of which are part of the equity-based compensation for key executives in fiscal 2018. 
The fiscal 2018 MTE grant was made in January 2019 once the Management Incentive Plan performance result was assessed and verified. Because the MTE grants are based on 2018 performance, the Compensation Committees believe that the discussion of these equity-based grants made after fiscal year end is important to understanding the overall Named Executive Officer compensation for the preceding year. 
Accordingly, we describe below the MTE grants made in early 2019 and the MTE grants made in early 2018 (which were discussed previously in last year's Proxy Statement but first appear in the "Summary Compensation Table" and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2018" table in this year's Proxy Statement). 
C.    Fiscal 2018 Annual Grants 
2018 MTE Grants. In January 2018, the Compensation Committees approved an MTE target grant value for each of our Named Executive Officers and certain other executives. Each target grant value was determined after consideration of recommendations received from Mr. Donald and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors, as well as reviewing the scope of the Named Executive Officer's responsibilities, performance and long-term retention considerations. There was no increase in the MTE target for the Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018. 
Following the end of fiscal 2018, the actual 2018 Management Incentive Plan payout percentage is applied to the MTE target grant value to determine the actual MTE grant values, which may be from zero to 200% of target. In January 2019, the actual MTE grant value earned was converted into a number of RSUs that cliff vest two years from the date of grant. The MTE grants do not receive dividends or have voting rights. Each MTE RSU is credited with dividend equivalents equal to the value of cash and stock dividends paid on Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares. The dividend equivalents will be distributed upon the settlement of the MTE RSUs only upon vesting. Please see the "Equity Grants Made During Fiscal 2019 as Compensation for Fiscal 2018" table for additional MTE grant details. 
The MTE grants made to our Named Executive Officers in January 2019 were as follows:

Perquisites and Other Compensation 
Our Named Executive Officers are provided various perquisites believed by the Compensation Committees to be representative of common practices for executives in their respective countries. Some of Messrs. Donald's and Thamm's perquisites and other benefits are provided pursuant to terms of their employment agreements. The Compensation Committees, with the assistance of FW Cook, review perquisites provided to our Named Executive Officers on a periodic basis and take into account each Named Executive Officer's particular circumstances and overall level of compensation, and believe that perquisites provided by Carnival Corporation & plc continue to be an appropriate element of the overall compensation package used to attract and retain such officers. 
COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report—Part I 
The Compensation Committees have approved a policy to establish procedures and controls as to the authorized use of aircraft owned or chartered by Carnival Corporation & plc (the "Aircraft"). According to the policy, the Aircraft can only be used for business purposes. Guests may accompany these executives when traveling. The Compensation Committees have also agreed to allow Mr. Donald to use the Aircraft for personal use so long as the incremental cost to Carnival Corporation & plc does not exceed $200,000 per year. Once that threshold is reached, Mr. Donald will reimburse us for those costs. The Compensation Committees determined that the Aircraft usage policy and levels of usage and costs were consistent with those offered by large multinational companies like Carnival Corporation & plc. 
The perquisites received by each Named Executive Officer in fiscal 2018, as well as their incremental cost to Carnival Corporation & plc, are reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" and its accompanying footnotes. 
Post-Employment Compensation Obligations 
Carnival Corporation & plc does not have any change of control agreements that provide cash severance to our Named Executive Officers upon a change of control of Carnival Corporation & plc, with the exception of the employment agreement with Mr. Donald. Carnival Corporation & plc does not have employment agreements with any of our Named Executive Officers that provide cash severance benefits in connection with the termination of the executive's employment, with the exception of employment agreements with Messrs. Donald and Thamm. 
Mr. Donald's employment agreement is subject to renewal annually on October 14th of each year. If Mr. Donald wishes to leave prior to the end of the current term, he would generally need to provide at least 60 days' written notice. The payments to Mr. Donald in the event of termination are set forth in the "Post-Employment Cash Compensation Obligations to Mr. Donald" section. 
Mr. Thamm's employment agreement provides that he is generally entitled to an amount equal to 50% of his total remuneration most recently received by him as compensation for his agreement not to engage in competition with us. The Compensation Committees believe that the severance benefits provided to Mr. Thamm under his employment agreement are reasonable and in accordance with market practice in European Union. 
Upon termination of employment for certain circumstances or upon a change of control, our Named Executive Officers may be entitled to retain or receive accelerated vesting of equity grants. Under the terms of the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan and the Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan, however, the default provision upon a change in control would provide only for a "double trigger" acceleration of equity grants (such that no acceleration would occur unless the participant's employment were subsequently terminated by Carnival Corporation & plc (or its successor) without cause). These benefits are provided under the terms of the plans pursuant to which the equity grants were made, the grant agreement and under individual agreements with certain Named Executive Officers. However, none of our Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive any tax gross-up payments in respect of their severance benefits or accelerated equity grants. The benefits that our Named Executive Officers may be eligible to receive in connection with the termination of their employment or upon a change of control are described in detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" section. 
The Compensation Committees believe that these arrangements are reasonable and encourage an executive to comply with post-termination non-compete and other restrictive covenants and to cooperate with us both before and after their employment is terminated.

COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report—Part I 
Pensions and Deferred Compensation Plans 
As part of the overall compensation program, Carnival Corporation & plc operates various group pension programs for certain of their executives. Under the Carnival Corporation pension programs, base salaries and annual bonuses were used to determine pension benefits. 
Until December 31, 1997, Mr. Perez participated in the Carnival Corporation Nonqualified Retirement Plan for Highly Compensated Employees (the "Retirement Plan"), which is a nonqualified defined benefit plan. His benefit accruals under the Retirement Plan then ceased and he began earning benefits under the Carnival Corporation Fun Ship Nonqualified Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"), which is a nonqualified defined contribution plan whereby certain executives were able to defer salary and/or bonus amounts into the Savings Plan. Until January 1, 2009, Messrs. Bernstein and Perez participated in the Savings Plan. 
Additional information regarding the Retirement Plan is included in the "Pension Benefits" table and the narrative which follows. Additional information regarding the Savings Plan is in the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal 2018" table and the narrative which follows. 
In accordance with Section 457A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Carnival Corporation paid out all benefits accrued under the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan in December 2017. 
In lieu of participation in the Savings Plan, the Compensation Committees approved payment of an additional annual bonus directly to these employees in an amount equal to what would have been deposited on behalf of those employees into those plans, less, as described below, any amount Carnival Corporation contributes to the Carnival Corporation Fun Ship Savings Plan, a 401(k) plan (the "401(k) Plan"). These payments are taxable as ordinary income. 
Beginning with the 2010 calendar year, the 401(k) Plan was amended and currently allows Messrs. Donald, Bernstein and Perez (as well as all other highly compensated employees) to defer a limited amount of compensation into the 401(k) Plan subject to nondiscrimination testing. Similarly, Carnival Corporation shall make a matching contribution to the 401(k) Plan under the plan's formula, subject to nondiscrimination testing. 
Stock Ownership Requirements 
Our Boards of Directors and Compensation Committees believe it is important for executive officers and Directors to build and maintain a long-term ownership position in Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc shares in order to align their financial interests with those of our shareholders and to encourage the creation of long-term value. Our compensation structure provides for a significant percentage of compensation to be equity-based, which places a substantial portion of compensation at risk over a long-term period. Accordingly, our Section 16 Officers, including our Named Executive Officers, are subject to a stock ownership policy. The policy specifies target ownership levels of Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc shares for each executive expressed in terms of the value of the equity holdings (excluding PBS and SEA grants which have not vested) as a multiple of each Section 16 Officer's base salary. The target ownership levels are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Officers       Ownership Target     Multiple of Base Salary     
  Officers       Ownership Target     Multiple of Base Salary     
   Chair and/or Chief Executive Officer      6X salary   
   Vice Chair and/or Chief Operating Officer      4X salary   
   Other Section 16 Officers      3X salary   
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION 
Report of the Compensation Committees 
Individuals who are newly designated as Section 16 Officers are expected to be in compliance with the stock ownership policy within five years of the date of becoming a Section 16 Officer. All of our Named Executive Officers are in compliance with the stock ownership policy. Our Section 16 Officers are restricted from trading call and put options and entering into any hedging transactions with respect to our shares. Carnival Corporation & plc does not make any commitment to any persons covered by the stock ownership policy that they will receive any particular level of equity-based grants. 
The stock ownership policy provides that Section 16 Officers be required to retain at least 50% of the shares received upon release after deducting withholding taxes, until their target ownership is achieved. 
Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Compensation 
In making determinations regarding executive compensation, the Compensation Committees consider relevant issues relating to accounting treatment, tax treatment (both company and individual) and regulatory requirements. The global nature of Carnival Corporation & plc's operations necessarily means that monitoring these technical issues and considering their potential impact on the appropriate design and operation of executive remuneration programs is an increasingly complex exercise. Technical issues are evaluated in light of Carnival Corporation & plc's philosophy and objectives for executive compensation and their corporate governance principles, as described earlier in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES 
The Compensation Committees have reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and discussed it with the management of Carnival Corporation & plc. Based on their review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committees recommended to our Boards of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be incorporated by reference into the Carnival Corporation & plc 2018 joint Annual Report on Form 10-K and included in the Carnival Corporation & plc 2019 Proxy Statement. This Report is provided by the following independent Directors, who comprise the Compensation Committees:

The Compensation Committees are comprised entirely of three independent Directors listed above. No member of the Compensation Committees is a current, or during fiscal 2018 was a former, officer or employee of Carnival Corporation, Carnival plc or any of their subsidiaries. During fiscal 2018, no member of the Compensation Committees had a relationship that must be described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of related person transactions. In fiscal 2018, none of our executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on the Board or the Compensation Committee of Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc.

(1)  No stock option grants were made in fiscal 2016 through 2018. The amounts included in the "Summary Compensation  Table" reflect the grant date fair value, assuming no risk of forfeiture of the grants of Carnival Corporation restricted shares and Carnival plc RSUs made to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018, calculated in accordance with ASC 718.  The valuation of share-based grants is discussed in Notes 2 and 12 to the financial statements in the Carnival Corporation & plc joint Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30,  2018. The amounts reflect the grant date fair value (100% of target) of the annual SEA grants made in January 2018 and PBS grants made in April 2018, calculated in accordance with ASC 718. The grant date fair value of the annual SEA grants and PBS  grants assuming combined maximum performance (being 600% and 200% of target, respectively) is $17,037,990 for Mr. Donald, $4,853,732 for Mr. Bernstein, $6,184,421 for Mr. Kruse, $1,788,350 for Mr. Perez and $6,525,700 for  Mr. Thamm. For the proceeds actually received by the Named Executive Officers upon the vesting of restricted shares or RSUs, see the "Stock Vested for Fiscal 2018" table. For the grant date fair value of equity grants made to our  Named Executive Officers as compensation for fiscal 2018, which grants were made in January 2019, see the "Equity Grants Made During Fiscal 2019 as Compensation for Fiscal 2018" table.

Compensation Tables 
The amounts set forth in the column entitled Stock Awards in the "Summary Compensation Table" do not represent the equity-based compensation granted as compensation for fiscal 2018. As required by SEC rules and as described in Note 1 to the "Summary Compensation Table," the amounts reported in this column only reflect the PBS, SEA and MTE grants made during fiscal 2018. The amounts reported in this column do not include value associated with MTE grants made in January 2019 that are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The MTE grants made to our Named Executive Officers in January 2019 as compensation for fiscal 2018 are as follows:

The  value for Carnival plc ordinary shares has been converted from sterling into U.S. dollars based on the January 14, 2019 exchange rate of $1.29:£1. The full grant date fair value for a grant is the amount that Carnival  Corporation & plc will expense in their financial statements over the grant's vesting period or until the retirement eligibility date, if such date is earlier than the vesting date, when vesting is not contingent upon any future  performance. The full grant date fair value may not correspond to the actual value that will be realized.

Until December 31, 2008, Messrs. Bernstein and Perez could defer salary and/or bonus amounts into the Savings Plan, which is a nonqualified defined contribution plan for U.S. tax purposes. As described in the "Pensions and Deferred Compensation Plans" section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, effective January 1, 2009, they could no longer defer any salary or bonus amounts into the Savings Plan. Although the Savings Plan is unfunded, Carnival Corporation had established a "rabbi trust" that held any executive deferrals and company contributions to the Savings Plan. 
Benefits were paid based on the participant's form and timing elections made in accordance with applicable Section 409A Treasury Regulations. Benefits were based on the participant's deferrals of cash compensation and associated earnings and losses based on the investment allocation selected by the participant. The investment options available to participants in the Savings Plan were identical to those available to participants in the 401(k) Plan, except for the Standard & Poor's index fund and money market investment options. A participant could have changed his or her investment allocation at any time. 
For every dollar Messrs. Bernstein and Perez deferred into the Savings Plan prior to January 1, 2009, Carnival Corporation matched 50% up to the lower of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service qualified plan limitation; or  
• 6% of his eligible pay.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
"Eligible pay" includes regular pay (before any pre-tax contributions from his pay and taxes) and bonus. Carnival Corporation also made profit sharing contributions into the Savings Plan based upon their eligible pay and years of service according to the following schedule: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Years of Service     Award (% of Eligible Pay) 
Years of Service     Award (% of Eligible Pay) 
[END TABLE]
Following the promulgation of Section 457A, salary and bonus deferrals into the Savings Plan are no longer permitted. As a result, Messrs. Donald, Bernstein and Perez and all other Savings Plan participants and those who are deemed highly compensated employees under IRS regulations are paid the equivalent of their annual matching award (less any amount actually contributed by Carnival Corporation to the 401(k) Plan on their behalf as a matching contribution) and profit sharing contribution as additional cash compensation. The effect of this provision will result in no additional benefit for Messrs. Donald, Bernstein and Perez and will not result in a material incremental cost to Carnival Corporation. As of November 30, 2018, Messrs. Donald, Bernstein and Perez had 6, 21 and 27 years of service, respectively. 
In accordance with Section 457A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Carnival Corporation paid out all benefits accrued under the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan in December 2017. 
Additional information with respect to pension plan arrangements for Carnival plc for the year ended November 30, 2018 is included in Part I of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report included in this Proxy Statement as the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Part II of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report, which is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.

In addition to benefits described below, our Named Executive Officers will be eligible to receive any benefits accrued under Carnival Corporation & plc broad-based benefit plans, such as distributions under life insurance and disability benefits and accrued vacation pay, in accordance with those plans and policies.

The Compensation Committees will continue to consider the individual circumstances of each case taking account of best practice in the UK and the U.S. and the expected cost to Carnival Corporation & plc of any termination of an executive's employment arrangements. 
Accordingly, Messrs. Bernstein, Kruse and Perez have no employment agreements and no entitlement to severance except for possible retention of unvested restricted share grants depending on the circumstances of their separation of employment discussed below. 
Messrs. Donald and Thamm are our only Named Executive Officers with employment agreements providing cash severance and other benefits.

Equity-Based Compensation 
Vesting of restricted shares and RSUs upon termination of a Named Executive Officer's employment is dependent upon the reasons his employment is terminated, the terms of the respective equity plan and the associated equity grant agreement. Equity grants made to our Named Executive Officers are subject to the same terms as all other participants generally, except as described below. 
Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan. All our Named Executive Officers received SEA grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan, In addition, all our Named Executive Officers except Mr. Thamm received MTE and PBS grants under the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan. The terms of the Carnival Corporation 2011 Stock Plan and the equity grant agreements applicable to participants generally provide that upon termination for death or disability, all unvested equity grants will immediately vest. The terms of the equity grants to Named Executive Officers provide that if their employment is terminated without cause or they voluntarily terminate due to a diagnosis of a terminal medical condition, the restricted share and MTE grants will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedule and remain subject to confidentiality and non-competition provisions. The SEA grants will also be retained if employment is terminated without cause. For the purposes of the agreement, "cause" is defined as any action or inaction which constitutes fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, dishonesty, breach of trust, a felony or moral turpitude, as determined by the Boards of Directors. 
Upon retirement, restricted share and MTE grants continue to vest according to their terms as though employment had not ended; provided, however, that as each participant reaches retirement age, 50% of the grant will immediately vest, if such participant becomes subject to tax withholding at that time. Retirement is defined as voluntary termination of an employee being at least 60 years of age with 15 years of service or at least 65 years of age with five years of service. Upon involuntary termination within 12 months after a change of control, the restricted period on all restricted shares and RSUs immediately expires. 
Change of control means the occurrence of any of the following:

• the acquisition by any individual, entity or group of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of either (A) the then  outstanding shares of common stock of Carnival Corporation or (B) the combined

All of the equity grants made to participants, including our Named Executive Officers, contain clawback and forfeiture provisions in the event of a violation of confidentiality or non-compete provisions (which restrict them from competing with Carnival Corporation & plc for the remainder of the grant's vesting period) or fraud or conduct contributing to any financial restatements or irregularities. 
Carnival plc Employee Share Plans. Mr. Thamm is the only Named Executive Officer who received grants under the Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan. Mr. Thamm receives the same treatment under the plans as other participants generally, except that if his employment is terminated without cause or he voluntarily terminates due to diagnosis of a terminal medical condition, all time-based share ("TBS") and MTE grants will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedule and remain subject to confidentiality and non-competition provisions. All grants vest upon termination of employment for death or disability. Upon retirement, all TBS and MTE grants will continue to vest according to their terms as if the employment had not been terminated. Retirement is defined as voluntary termination of an employee being at least 60 years of age with 15 years of service or at least 65 years of age with five years of service. Upon involuntary termination within 12 months after a change of control, the restricted period on all RSUs immediately expires.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• a person (either alone or together with any person acting in concert with him) obtaining control of Carnival plc as a  result of a general offer or otherwise for the whole of the share capital of Carnival plc (other than those shares which are already owned by him and/or any person acting in concert with him);  
• the acquisition by any individual, entity or group of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of either (A) the then  outstanding shares of Carnival plc or (B) the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of Carnival plc entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors, except that this provision does not apply to affiliated  companies or members of the Arison family;

CEO PAY RATIO 
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee. The 2018 annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table is $13,515,884, the 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee is $16,622, and the ratio of these amounts is 813 to 1. Our median compensated employee population consists of ship-based personnel who work fewer than twelve months of the year. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our global human resources and payroll systems of record and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to

COMPENSATION 
CEO Pay Ratio apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
To identify our median employee, we used total cash compensation for our estimated employee population of 154,161 as of October 31 2018 and excluded 7,492 employees from the following 30 foreign jurisdictions: Albania (38), Algeria (1), Armenia (1), Bangladesh (26), Belize (13), Bhutan (18), Bosnia & Herzegovina (448), Brazil (1,188), Cambodia (1), China (1,785), Georgia (53), Guinea (1), Honduras (972), Kazakhstan (12), Kenya (44), Kyrgyzstan (32), Malaysia (180), Moldova (155), Myanmar (498), Namibia (18), Nepal (217), Nicaragua (350), Pakistan (160), Paraguay (4), South Korea (73), Sri Lanka (623), St Vincent & The Grenadines (84), Vanuatu (290), Vietnam (198) and Zambia (9). Our workforce includes a large number of ship-based employees who typically work six to eleven months of the year and we did not annualize the pay for our employees when identifying our median. 
We then applied a valid statistical sampling methodology to the remaining 149,669 employees to identify employees who were paid within a 5% range of the median. From these employees, we then selected a subset of 21 employees who were at or substantially similar to the median, identified a representative median employee from this group and calculated that employee's annual total compensation in fiscal 2018 consistent with Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K. This figure includes gratuities directly billed to our guests, but excludes any cash gratuities paid directly to the employee by guests. It also excludes room and meals, transportation to and from the ship and medical care, which are provided to our crew members without charge.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEES 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are two separate legal entities and, therefore, each has a separate Board of Directors, each of which in turn has its own Audit Committee. In accordance with their charter, each Audit Committee assists the relevant Board of Directors in carrying out its oversight of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of the relevant financial statements;  
• Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, other than requirements  related to HESS;  
• the auditors' qualifications and independence;  
• the performance of Carnival Corporation & plc's internal audit functions and independent auditors; and   
• relevant elements of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc's risk management programs.  
[END TABLE]
Both Audit Committees are subject to the audit committee independence requirements under the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange and relevant SEC rules, and the Audit Committee of Carnival plc is also subject to the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The two Audit Committees have identical members and each currently consists of five independent (as defined by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, SEC rules and the UK Corporate Governance Code) Non-Executive Directors. The Carnival Corporation Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committees is both "independent" and an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by SEC rules and New York Stock Exchange listing standards. In addition, the Carnival plc Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committees has "recent and relevant financial experience" for purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code and that the Audit Committees as a whole have competence relevant to the sector in which Carnival Corporation & plc operate. 
Management has primary responsibility for Carnival Corporation & plc's financial reporting process, including their system of internal control, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements. Carnival Corporation & plc's independent auditor is responsible for performing an independent audit of those financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committees are responsible for monitoring and overseeing the financial reporting process and the preparation of consolidated financial statements and for supervising the relationship between Carnival Corporation & plc and its independent auditor, as well as reviewing the group's systems of internal controls and compliance with the group Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Audit Committees have met and held discussions with management of Carnival Corporation & plc and the independent auditor. In this context, management represented to the Audit Committees that Carnival Corporation & plc's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Audit Committees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed Carnival Corporation & plc's audited consolidated financial statements for the year  ended November 30, 2018 with Carnival Corporation & plc's management and with Carnival Corporation & plc's independent auditor;

The Audit Committees have adopted Key Policies and Procedures which address, among other matters, pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Key Policies and Procedures require that all services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm must be approved by the Audit Committees prior to the performance of such services. The Audit Committees consider whether the services requested are consistent with the rules of the SEC and UK Financial Reporting Council on auditor independence. 
PROPOSALS 15 & 16 
RE-APPOINTMENT AND REMUNERATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS OF CARNIVAL PLC AND RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF CARNIVAL CORPORATION 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Carnival plc has selected the UK firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Carnival plc's independent auditors for the year ending November 30, 2019. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Carnival Corporation has selected the U.S. firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Carnival Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending November 30, 2019. Representatives of both the U.S. and UK firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meetings, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
Proposal 15 would re-appoint the UK firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent auditors of Carnival plc until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of Carnival plc. It is a requirement of Section 489(2) of the Companies Act that Carnival plc appoint its independent auditors before the end of a general meeting at which its annual accounts and reports are laid (which occurs at its Annual General Meeting). Proposal 15 would also ratify the selection of the U.S. firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of Carnival Corporation. 
Although ratification by our shareholders of the appointment of an independent public accounting firm of Carnival Corporation is not legally required, our Boards of Directors believe that such action is desirable. If our shareholders do not approve Proposal 15, the Audit Committees will consider the selection of another accounting firm for 2020 and future years. 
Under Proposal 16, you are being asked to authorize the Audit Committee of Carnival plc to determine the remuneration of the UK firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors of Carnival plc. 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the re-appointment of the UK firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Carnival plc's independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year, the ratification of the selection of the U.S. firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Carnival Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year and the authorization of the Audit Committee of Carnival plc to determine the remuneration of the UK firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.

PROPOSAL 17 
RECEIPT OF ACCOUNTS AND REPORTS OF CARNIVAL PLC 
The Directors of Carnival plc are required by the Companies Act to present Carnival plc's financial statements, the UK statutory Directors' Report, the UK statutory Strategic Report and the auditors' report relating to those accounts to the Carnival plc shareholders. Accordingly, the Directors of Carnival plc lay before the Annual Meetings the Carnival plc accounts and the reports of the Directors and auditors for the year ended November 30, 2018, which have been approved by and signed on behalf of Carnival plc's Board of Directors and will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in the UK following the Annual Meetings. Shareholders are voting to approve receipt of these documents, as UK law does not require shareholder approval of the substance and content of these documents. The UK statutory Directors' Report is attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement and the UK statutory Strategic Report is included within the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements. The full accounts and reports of Carnival plc will be available for inspection prior to and during the Annual Meetings. 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the receipt of the accounts and reports of Carnival plc for the year ended November 30, 2018. 
PROPOSALS 18 & 19 
APPROVAL OF THE GRANT OF AUTHORITY TO ALLOT NEW CARNIVAL PLC SHARES AND THE DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS APPLICABLE TO THE ALLOTMENT OF NEW CARNIVAL PLC SHARES 
Summary. Proposal 18 authorizes the Directors of Carnival plc to issue, until the next Annual General Meeting of Carnival plc (or, if earlier, until the close of business on July 15, 2020), a maximum number of Carnival plc ordinary shares (or to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into ordinary shares up to a maximum aggregate amount) without further shareholder approval. Proposal 19 authorizes the Directors of Carnival plc to issue (or sell any ordinary shares which Carnival plc elects to hold in treasury), until the next Annual General Meeting of Carnival plc (or, if earlier, until the close of business on July 15, 2020), a maximum number of Carnival plc ordinary shares for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in accordance with the pre-emption rights that would otherwise be applicable. As is the case with many UK companies, these resolutions are proposed each year as the Directors believe occasions may arise from time to time when it would be beneficial for shares to be allotted without shareholder approval and for shares to be allotted for cash without making a pre-emptive offer. The Carnival plc Directors have no current commitments or plans to allot additional shares of Carnival plc using these authorities. 
Discussion. Under Article 30 of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc, the Directors have, for a "prescribed period," unconditional authority to allot ordinary shares in Carnival plc up to an aggregate nominal amount known as the "allotment amount." 
The power to implement the authority provided by Article 30 is sought each year by the proposal of an ordinary resolution to establish the prescribed period and the allotment amount. By passing this ordinary resolution, shareholders are authorizing the Board of Carnival plc to issue, during the prescribed period, a maximum number of shares having an aggregate nominal value equal to the allotment amount, without further shareholder approval. In the absence of such approval, the issuance of any additional shares would require shareholder approval. 
OTHER PROPOSALS 
Approval of the Grant of Authority to Allot New Carnival plc Shares and the Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights Applicable to the Allotment of New Carnival plc Shares 
Under Article 31 of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc, the Directors have, for the same "prescribed period" referred to above, power to allot a small number of ordinary shares for cash without making a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders, up to an aggregate nominal amount known as the "disapplication amount." 
The power to implement the authority provided by Article 31 is sought each year by the proposal of a special resolution to establish the disapplication amount. By passing this special resolution, shareholders are authorizing the Board of Carnival plc to issue, during the prescribed period, an amount of shares having an aggregate nominal value equal to the disapplication amount, for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders of Carnival plc. 
The Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Carnival Corporation do not contain equivalent provisions and holders of Carnival Corporation common stock do not have pre-emption rights. Accordingly, no action is required in respect of the ability of Carnival Corporation to allot shares or to disapply pre-emption rights. 
In common with many UK companies, resolutions to renew the prescribed period and re-establish the allotment amount and the disapplication amount are normally proposed each year as the Directors believe occasions may arise from time to time when it would be beneficial for shares to be allotted and for shares to be allotted for cash without making a pre-emptive offer. This is the purpose of Proposal 18 (an ordinary resolution) and Proposal 19 (a special resolution). As usual, the prescribed period is the period from the passing of the resolutions until the next Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, until the close of business on July 15, 2020). 
Guidelines issued by the Investment Association, whose members are some of the largest institutional investors in UK listed companies, require the allotment amount to be limited to one-third of the issued ordinary share capital (except in the case of a rights issue). By reference to Carnival plc's issued ordinary share capital on January 17, 2019, the maximum allotment amount in paragraph (a) of Proposal 18 is $106,171,191, which is equal to 63,958,549 new Carnival plc ordinary shares, being one-third of the amount of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares). 
In line with guidance issued by the Investment Association, paragraph (b) of Proposal 18 would give the Directors of Carnival plc authority to allot ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into ordinary shares in connection with a rights issue in favor of ordinary shareholders up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to $212,342,382 (representing 127,917,098 ordinary shares), as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under paragraph (a) of Proposal 18. This amount (before any reduction) represents approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Carnival plc as at January 17, 2019. However, if they do exercise the authorities given to them if Proposals 18 and 19 are passed, the Directors intend to follow the Investment Association's recommendations concerning their use (including as regards the Directors standing for election or re-election in certain cases). 
Guidelines issued by the Pre-Emption Group, a group comprising representatives of UK listed companies, investment institutions and corporate finance practitioners and formed under the support of the London Stock Exchange to monitor the operation of the Guidelines, recommend that a resolution to disapply the statutory pre-emption rights provided by UK company law should be limited to an amount of equity securities not exceeding 5% of the nominal value of the company's issued ordinary share capital. By reference to Carnival plc's issued ordinary share capital on January 17, 2019, the maximum disapplication amount is $15,925,678, which is equal to 9,593,782 new Carnival plc ordinary shares. In respect of this aggregate nominal amount, the Directors of Carnival plc confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of

[END TABLE]
OTHER PROPOSALS 
General Authority to Buy Back Carnival plc Ordinary Shares authorities within a rolling three-year period where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% should not take place without prior consultation with shareholders. 
In summary, if Proposals 18 and 19 were passed, the extent of the authority of the Directors to allot new Carnival plc ordinary shares for cash on terms which would be dilutive to the existing shareholdings of Carnival plc shareholders, without shareholder approval, would be limited to 9,593,782 new Carnival plc ordinary shares, being 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of Carnival plc at January 17, 2019. The Directors have no current commitments or plans to allot additional shares of Carnival plc under these authorities. Furthermore, the adoption of Proposals 18 and 19 would have no material effect on the ability of Carnival plc to undertake or defend against a takeover attempt. 
In addition to the Repurchase Program (described below), we also have programs that allow us to obtain an economic benefit when either Carnival Corporation common stock is trading at a premium to the price of Carnival plc ordinary shares or Carnival plc ordinary shares are trading at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock (the "Stock Swap Programs"). For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event Carnival Corporation common stock trades at a premium to Carnival plc ordinary shares, we may elect to sell  shares of Carnival Corporation common stock, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers' transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of Carnival plc ordinary shares in the UK market.  
• In the event Carnival plc ordinary shares trade at a premium to Carnival Corporation common stock, we may elect to sell  ordinary shares of Carnival plc, at prevailing market prices in ordinary brokers' transactions and repurchase an equivalent number of shares of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U.S.  
[END TABLE]
Any realized economic benefit under the Stock Swap Programs is used for general corporate purposes, which could include repurchasing additional stock under the Repurchase Program. 
Under the Stock Swap Programs effective 2008, the Boards of Directors have made the following authorizations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In January 2017, to sell up to 22.0 million of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U.S. market and repurchase  up to 22.0 million of Carnival plc ordinary shares in the UK market.  
• In February 2016, to sell up to 26.9 million of existing shares of Carnival plc in the UK market and repurchase up  to 26.9 million shares of Carnival Corporation common stock in the U.S. market.  
[END TABLE]
As of January 17, 2019, 25,469,458 Carnival plc ordinary shares are held by Carnival plc in treasury. 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the approval of limits on the authority to allot Carnival plc shares and the disapplication of pre-emption rights for Carnival plc. 
PROPOSAL 20 
GENERAL AUTHORITY TO BUY BACK CARNIVAL PLC ORDINARY SHARES 
The Boards of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $1 billion of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares subject to certain restrictions (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued by our Boards of Directors at any time. 
At January 17, 2019, the remaining availability under the Repurchase Program was $542.6 million. We may repurchase shares of Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares under the Repurchase Program, in addition to repurchases made with net proceeds resulting from the Stock Swap programs described above. 
OTHER PROPOSALS 
General Authority to Buy Back Carnival plc Ordinary Shares 
Shareholder approval is not required for us to buy back shares of Carnival Corporation, but is required under the Companies Act for us to buy back shares of Carnival plc. Accordingly, last year Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc sought and obtained shareholder approval to effect market purchases of up to 20,934,527 ordinary shares of Carnival plc (being approximately 10% of Carnival plc's ordinary shares in issue). That approval expires on the earlier of (i) the conclusion of Carnival plc's 2019 Annual General Meeting or (ii) July 10, 2019. Shareholder approval to effect market purchases (within the meaning of Section 693(4) of the Companies Act) once the current authorization expires of up to 19,187,564 ordinary shares of Carnival plc (being 10% of Carnival plc's ordinary shares in issue as of January 17, 2019) is being sought at this year's Annual Meetings. Since last year's Annual Meetings and through January 17, 2019, 14,664,377 Carnival plc ordinary shares have been purchased under the Repurchase Program and the Stock Swap programs. Carnival Corporation & plc treats any such purchases made by Carnival Corporation or Carnival Investments Limited under the Repurchase Program or the Stock Swap programs as if they were made by Carnival plc under the Carnival plc share buy back authority. 
The Boards of Directors confirm that the authority to purchase Carnival plc's shares under the Repurchase Program and the Stock Swap program will only be exercised after careful consideration of prevailing market conditions and the position of Carnival plc. In particular, the program will only proceed if we believe that it is in the best interests of Carnival Corporation, Carnival plc and their shareholders generally. The Boards of Directors are making no recommendation as to whether shareholders should sell any shares in Carnival plc and/or Carnival Corporation. 
If the Boards of Directors exercise the authority conferred by Proposal 20, we would have the option of holding the shares in treasury, or cancelling them. Shares held in treasury can be re-sold for cash, used for employee share plans or later cancelled. The Boards of Directors think it prudent to maintain discretion as to dealing with the purchased shares. As of January 17, 2019, 25,469,458 Carnival plc ordinary shares are held by Carnival plc in treasury. 
The Boards of Directors consider that any buyback of Carnival plc ordinary shares may include the purchase of its American Depositary Shares ("ADSs"), each representing one Carnival plc ordinary share, with a subsequent cancellation of the underlying ADSs. If the underlying ADSs are so cancelled, Carnival plc will either cancel or hold in treasury the ordinary share represented by such ADSs. 
The minimum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each Carnival plc ordinary share is $1.66, and the maximum price which may be paid is an amount (exclusive of expenses) equal to the higher of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 105% of the average middle market quotations for an ordinary share, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily  Official List, for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which such ordinary share is contracted to be purchased; and  
• the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the London Stock  Exchange at the time the purchase is carried out.  
[END TABLE]
As of January 17, 2019, there are no options outstanding to subscribe for Carnival plc ordinary shares and Carnival plc has issued 413,019 RSUs, which represent in the aggregate less than 1% of Carnival plc's issued share capital. If 19,187,564 ordinary shares of Carnival plc were purchased by Carnival plc and cancelled, these RSUs would represent in the aggregate less than 1% of Carnival plc's issued share capital. 
The authority to purchase Carnival plc ordinary shares will expire at the conclusion of the Carnival plc Annual General Meeting in 2020 or on July 15, 2020, whichever is earlier (except in relation to any purchases of shares the contract for which was entered before the expiry of such authority). 
The Boards of Directors unanimously recommend a vote FOR the general authority to buy back Carnival plc ordinary shares.

Q:  How does the DLC arrangement affect my voting rights?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  On most matters that affect all of the shareholders of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, the shareholders  of both companies effectively vote together as a single decision-making body. These matters are called "joint electorate actions." Combined voting is accomplished through the special voting shares that have been issued by each company.  Certain matters specified in the organizational documents of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc where the interests of the two shareholder bodies may diverge are called "class rights actions." The class rights actions are voted on  separately by the shareholders of each company. If either group of shareholders does not approve a class rights action, that action generally cannot be taken by either company. All of the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meetings are joint  electorate actions, and there are no class rights actions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Generally, what actions are joint electorate actions?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Any resolution to approve an action other than a class rights action or a procedural resolution (described  below) is designated as a joint electorate action. The actions designated as joint electorate actions include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appointment, removal, election or re-election of any Director of either or  both companies;  
• if required by law, the receipt or adoption of the annual accounts of both companies;  
• the appointment or removal of the independent auditors of either company;  
• a change of name by either or both companies; or  
• the implementation of a mandatory exchange of Carnival plc ordinary shares for Carnival Corporation common stock based  on a change in tax laws, rules or regulations.  
[END TABLE]
The relative voting rights of Carnival plc ordinary shares and Carnival Corporation common stock are equalized based on a ratio which we refer to as the "equalization ratio." Based on the current equalization ratio of 1:1, each share of Carnival Corporation common stock has the same voting rights as one Carnival plc ordinary share on joint electorate actions. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Questions Applicable to all Shareholders 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are joint electorate actions voted on?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Joint electorate actions are voted on as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Carnival plc shareholders vote at the Annual General Meeting of Carnival plc (whether in person or by proxy). Voting is  on a poll (or ballot), which remains open for sufficient time to allow the vote at the Carnival Corporation Annual Meeting to be held and reflected in the Carnival plc Annual General Meeting through the mechanism of the special voting share. An  equivalent vote is cast at the subsequent Carnival Corporation Annual Meeting on each of the corresponding resolutions through a special voting share issued by Carnival Corporation; and  
• Carnival Corporation shareholders vote at the Carnival Corporation Annual Meeting (whether in person or by proxy).  Voting is by ballot (or on a poll), which remains open for sufficient time to allow the vote at the Carnival plc Annual General Meeting to be reflected in the Carnival Corporation Annual Meeting through the mechanism of the special voting share. An  equivalent vote is cast on the corresponding resolutions at the Carnival plc Annual General Meeting through a special voting share issued by Carnival plc.  
[END TABLE]
A joint electorate action is approved if it is approved by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a simple majority of the votes cast in the case of an ordinary resolution (or not less than 75% of the votes cast in the  case of a special resolution, if required by applicable law and regulations or Carnival plc's Articles of Association) by the holders of Carnival plc's ordinary shares and the holder of the Carnival plc special voting share voting as a  single class at a meeting at which a quorum was present and acting;  
• a simple majority of the votes cast (or other majority if required by applicable law and regulations or the Carnival  Corporation Articles of Incorporation and By-laws) by the holders of Carnival Corporation common stock and the holder of the Carnival Corporation special voting share, voting as a single class at a meeting  which a quorum was present and acting; and  
• a minimum of one-third of the total votes available to be voted by the combined  shareholders must be cast on each resolution for it to be effective. Formal abstentions (or votes withheld) by a shareholder on a resolution will be counted as having been "cast" for this purpose.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are the Directors of each company elected or re-elected?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Resolutions relating to the election or re-election of Directors are  considered as joint electorate actions. No person may be a member of the Board of Directors of Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc without also being a member of the Board of Directors of the other company. There are 12 nominees for election or re-election to the Board of Directors of each company this year. Each nominee currently serves as a Director of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc. All nominees for Director are to be elected or re-elected to serve until the next Annual Meetings and until their successors are elected.  
[END TABLE]
Carnival plc's Articles of Association currently require Directors to submit themselves for election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting following their initial appointment to the Board of Directors and for re-election thereafter at subsequent Annual General Meetings at intervals of no more than three years. The Boards of Directors have decided, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, to submit all Directors for re-election on an annual basis.

[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of Carnival Corporation common stock and do not provide the shareholder of record with voting instructions, your shares may constitute broker non-votes. 
Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner; and  
• the broker lacks discretionary voting power to vote such shares.  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly if you are a beneficial owner of shares held through intermediaries such as brokers, banks and other nominees, such intermediaries are not permitted to vote without specific instructions from you unless the matter to be voted on is considered "routine." In this Proxy Statement, Proposals 15 and 16 (the re-appointment and remuneration of independent auditors of Carnival plc and the ratification of independent registered public accounting firm of Carnival Corporation), Proposal 17 (the receipt of accounts and reports of Carnival plc), Proposal 18 (allotment of new shares by Carnival plc), Proposal 19 (disapplication of pre-emption rights in relation to the allotment of new shares by Carnival plc) and Proposal 20 (general authority for Carnival plc to buy back Carnival plc ordinary shares) are considered "routine," and therefore, brokers are permitted to vote on these proposals without receiving voting instructions from you. On each of the other proposals (the election or re-election of Directors in Proposals 1-12, the approval of the fiscal 2018 compensation of our Named Executive Officers in Proposal 13, and approval of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report in Proposal 14), your broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares without receiving voting instructions from you. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Generally, what are procedural resolutions?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Procedural resolutions are resolutions of a procedural or technical nature that do not adversely affect the  shareholders of the other company in any material respect and are put to the shareholders at a meeting. The special voting shares do not represent any votes on "procedural resolutions." The Chair of each of the meetings will determine  whether a resolution is a procedural resolution.  
[END TABLE]
To the extent that such matters require the approval of the shareholders of either company, any of the following will be procedural resolutions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• that certain people be allowed to attend or be excluded from attending the meeting;  
• that discussion be closed and the question put to the vote (provided no amendments have been raised);   
• that the question under discussion not be put to the vote (where a shareholder feels the original motion should not be  put to the meeting at all, if such original motion was brought during the course of that meeting);  
• to proceed with matters in an order other than that set out in the notice of the meeting;  
• to adjourn the debate (for example, to a subsequent meeting); and  
• to adjourn the meeting.

Q:  What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meetings?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The quorum requirement for holding the Annual Meetings and transacting business as joint electorate actions at  the meetings is one-third of the total votes capable of being cast by all shareholders of both companies. Shareholders may be present in person or represented by proxy or corporate representative at the  meetings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How is the quorum determined?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  For the purposes of determining a quorum with respect to joint electorate actions, the special voting shares  have the maximum number of votes attached to them as were cast on such joint electorate actions, either for, against or abstained, at the parallel shareholder meeting of the other company, and such maximum number of votes (including abstentions)  constitutes shares entitled to vote and present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at such a meeting.  
[END TABLE]
In order for a quorum to be validly constituted with respect to meetings of shareholders convened to consider a joint electorate action or class rights action, the special voting entities must be present. 
Abstentions (including votes withheld) and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a  manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed to third parties except:

Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet  availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Carnival Corporation is taking advantage of SEC rules that allow it to deliver proxy materials over the  Internet. Under these rules, Carnival Corporation is sending its shareholders a one-page notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy  Materials") instead of a full set of proxy materials, unless they previously requested to receive printed copies. You will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless you specifically request them. Instead, this notice tells you  how to access and review on the Internet all the important information contained in the proxy materials. This notice also tells you how to submit your proxy card on the Internet and how to request to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials.

Q:  What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Shareholder of Record 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Carnival Corporation's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services LLC, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record, and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of printed proxy materials, as applicable, is being sent directly to you by us.

As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder giving you the right to vote the shares.

Directors' Report 
Carnival plc and Carnival Corporation are separate legal entities (together referred to as "Carnival Corporation & plc") and each company has its own Board of Directors and Committees of the Board. However, as is required by the agreements governing the dual listed company ("DLC") arrangement, there is a single senior management team and the Boards of Directors and members of the Committees of the Boards are identical. This Directors' Report has been prepared and presented in accordance with and in reliance upon UK company law and, accordingly, the liabilities of the Directors in connection with this Directors' Report shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions provided by such law. 
In accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, the information to be included in the Annual Report and Accounts, where applicable, under Listing Rule 9.8.4, is set out in this Directors' Report, with the exception of the details regarding interest capitalized, which are set out in the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements, and the details of long-term incentive schemes, which are set out in the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. 
Future developments of the business and business model of Carnival Corporation & plc can be found in the Strategic Report that accompanies the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements under the following sections, respectively: 1.A.II Visions, Goals and Related Strategies and 1.C. Our Global Cruise Business. The financial risk management objectives and policies and exposure to foreign currency risk, fair value risk, cash flow interest rate risk and liquidity risk can be found in Note 23. 
Dividends 
During the year ended November 30, 2018, Carnival plc paid four regular quarterly dividends totaling $1.90 per ordinary share (2017—$1.55). In January 2019, the Boards of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. For this quarterly dividend, the Boards of Directors approved a record date of February 22, 2019, and a payment date of March 15, 2019. 
Although dividends are declared in U.S. dollars, they are paid in sterling to the holders of ordinary shares in Carnival plc unless they elect to receive their dividends in U.S. dollars. Dividends payable in sterling are converted from U.S. dollars into sterling at the U.S. dollar to sterling exchange rate quoted by Bloomberg in London at 12:00 p.m. on the next combined U.S. and UK business day that follows the quarter end. 
Holders of the Carnival plc's American Depositary Shares are paid their dividend in U.S. dollars. 
Since January 2004, Ocorian Trustees (Jersey) Limited, as trustee of the P&O Princess Cruises Employee Benefit Trust, holds shares to satisfy grants made under Carnival plc 2014 Employee Share Plan. The trustee has waived its right to all dividends payable by Carnival plc. Dividends paid during fiscal 2018 over which rights were waived amounted to $405,789. 
Share Capital and Control 
Changes in the share capital of Carnival plc during fiscal 2018 are given in Note 16 to the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements. 
The share capital of Carnival plc at January 17, 2019 includes two allotted and issued subscriber shares of £1 each, 50,000 allotted but unissued redeemable preference shares of £1 each, one allotted

and issued special voting share of £1 and 191,875,647 allotted and issued ordinary shares of $1.66 each. The subscriber shares carry no voting rights and no right to receive any dividend or any amount paid on a return of capital. The redeemable preference shares carry no voting rights, but are entitled to payment of a cumulative preferential fixed dividend of eight percent per annum on the amount paid up on each such share that is in issue. On a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise, the redeemable preference shares rank behind the ordinary shares but ahead of any other class of shares, and are entitled to receive payment of the amount paid up or credited as paid up on each such share. Redeemable preference shares which are fully paid may be redeemed at any time at the election of the holder or of the company, in which case the amount payable on redemption is the amount credited as paid up on each share which is redeemed, together with all arrears and accruals of the preferential dividend. 
Details of restricted stock units granted to employees are given in Note 19 to the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements. 
The Articles of Association of Carnival plc contain provisions which, in certain circumstances, would have the effect of preventing a shareholder (or a group of shareholders acting in concert) from holding or exercising the voting rights attributable to shares in Carnival plc which are acquired by them. These provisions would have effect if a shareholder (or a group of shareholders acting in concert) were to acquire ordinary shares in Carnival plc with the result that the total voting rights exercisable by that shareholder or group of shareholders on matters put to a vote as joint electorate actions under the DLC arrangement would exceed 30 percent of the total voting rights exercisable in respect of any joint electorate action. They would also have effect if a shareholder (or group of shareholders acting in concert) already holding between 30 percent and 50 percent of the total voting rights exercisable in respect of any joint electorate action were to acquire shares in Carnival plc and thereby increase the percentage of voting rights so held. In each such case, the percentage of voting rights held is determined after taking into account voting rights attributable to shares of Carnival Corporation common stock held by such shareholder (or group of shareholders) and also taking into account the effect of the equalization ratio which gives effect to common voting by the shareholders of Carnival plc and Carnival Corporation on joint electorate actions under the DLC arrangement. 
Under the relevant provisions of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc (articles 277 to 287) shares which are acquired by a person and which trigger the thresholds referred to in the foregoing paragraph may be sold at the direction of the Board, and the proceeds remitted to the acquiring shareholder, net of any costs incurred by Carnival plc. Pending such sale any dividends paid in respect of such shares would be paid to a charitable trust, and the trustee of such trust would be entitled to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares. 
The restrictions summarized in the preceding paragraphs would not apply in the case of an acquisition of shares that is made in conjunction with a takeover offer for Carnival plc, which is announced in accordance with the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, for so long as that offer has not lapsed or been withdrawn. However, if such a takeover offer is not made, or lapses or is withdrawn, the restrictions will apply in respect of any acquired shares. 
The foregoing is a summary only of the relevant provisions of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc, and for a complete understanding of their effect, shareholders are recommended to refer to the Articles of Association themselves. A copy of the Articles of Association of Carnival plc is available at Carnival plc's website at www.carnivalplc.com or upon request from the Company Secretary, 3655 N.W. 87th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33178, United States of America. 
There is one significant agreement to which Carnival plc is a party, which may be altered or terminated in the event of a change of control. This is the Amendment and Restatement Agreement dated June 16, 2014 in respect of the Facilities Agreement dated May 18, 2011, as further amended and

extended from time to time, by and among Carnival Corporation, Carnival plc, Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, and various other lenders, which provides for approximately $1.9 billion, €500 million and £169 million revolving credit facilities and which may, under certain circumstances, be cancelled upon a change of control of Carnival plc, other than a change which results in control of Carnival plc being vested in Carnival Corporation or in certain members of the Arison family or trusts related to them. 
Articles of Association 
The Articles of Association of Carnival plc may be amended by the passing of a special resolution of the shareholders. In common with many other corporate actions that might be undertaken by Carnival plc, such a resolution would be proposed as a joint electorate action on which the shareholders of Carnival plc and of Carnival Corporation effectively vote as a single unified body, as contemplated by the DLC arrangement. 
Purchase of Own Shares 
The Boards of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares subject to certain restrictions (the "Repurchase Program"). At January 17, 2019, the availability under the Repurchase Program was $543 million. The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued by the Boards of Directors at any time. 
In addition to the Repurchase Program, the Boards of Directors have authorized the repurchase of up to 22 million Carnival plc ordinary shares and up to 26.9 million shares of Carnival Corporation common stock under the Stock Swap programs described in the Carnival Corporation & plc 2018 joint Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Shareholder approval is not required to buy back shares of Carnival Corporation, but is required under the Companies Act to buy back shares of Carnival plc. At the Annual General Meetings held on April 11, 2018, the authority for Carnival plc to buy back its own shares was approved. This authority enabled Carnival plc to buy back up to 20,934,527 ordinary shares of Carnival plc (being approximately 10 percent of Carnival plc's ordinary shares in issue). Under that authority, 14,664,377 Carnival plc ordinary shares have been purchased through January 17, 2019. That approval expires on the earlier of:

Carnival Corporation & plc treats any such repurchases made by Carnival Corporation or Carnival Investments Limited under the Repurchase Program and the Stock Swap Programs as if they were made by Carnival plc under the Carnival plc buy back authority. 
Directors

Corporate and Social Responsibility 
Health, environmental, safety and security 
The Boards of Directors of Carnival Corporation & plc established Board-level Health, Environmental, Safety & Security ("HESS") Committees comprised of four independent Directors. The principal function of the HESS Committees is to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assist the Boards in fulfilling their responsibility to supervise and monitor Carnival Corporation & plc's  health, environmental, safety, security and sustainability-related policies, programs, initiatives at sea and ashore; and  
• comply with related legal and regulatory requirements relating to health, environmental, safety, security and  sustainability.  
[END TABLE]
The HESS Committees and our management team review all significant risks or exposures and associated mitigating actions. Each of the Chief Executive Officers of our brands attends the meetings of the HESS Committees. 
Carnival Corporation & plc recognizes our responsibility to provide industry leadership and to conduct our business as a responsible global citizen. Our corporate leadership is manifested in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which requires that every employee and member of the Boards use sound judgment, maintain high ethical standards and demonstrate honesty in all business dealings. As a responsible global citizen, Carnival Corporation & plc is committed to achieving and maintaining the highest standards of professional and ethical conduct. 
In addition, Carnival Corporation & plc's HESS Policy describes our commitments to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• protecting the health, safety and security of our passengers, guests, employees and all others working on our behalf,  thereby promoting an organization that strives to be free of injuries, illness and loss;  
• protecting the environment, including the marine environment in which our vessels sail and the communities in which we  operate, striving to prevent adverse environmental consequences and using resources efficiently and sustainably;  
• complying with or exceeding all legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and  sustainability throughout our business activities; and  
• assigning health, environment, safety, security and sustainability matters the same priority as other critical business  matters.  
[END TABLE]
The HESS Policy is published on the Carnival Corporation & plc website at www.carnivalcorp.com or www.carnivalplc.com. 
The Boards recognize that Carnival Corporation & plc needs to ensure that there is a consistent standard of operation throughout their fleet in keeping with their leading position in the cruise industry. In this regard, the Carnival Corporation & plc Maritime Operations Department is headed by a Chief Maritime Officer, with a full-time professional and administrative staff, and is responsible for providing a common, integrated approach to management of HESS matters and for reporting to the HESS Committees on such matters. The Chief Maritime Officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Chair of the HESS Committees. 
Risk Advisory & Assurance Services ("RAAS") is Carnival Corporation & plc's internal audit department and is headed by the Chief Audit Officer, who reports directly to the Chairs of the Audit and HESS Committees. The Chief Audit Officer also has a "dotted" reporting line to the General Counsel. RAAS conducts annual HESS audits of each brand's head office and of each ship in our fleet. These audits are in addition to the audits performed by external third-party certification and regulatory auditors.

[END TABLE]
Carnival Corporation & plc has long been committed to operating responsibly. We believe that sustainability is about preserving our environment, respecting our employees and the communities where we do business and returning value to our shareholders. We voluntarily publish Sustainability Reports that address governance, stakeholder engagement, environmental, labor, human rights, society, product responsibility, economic and other sustainability-related issues and performance indicators. These reports, which can be viewed at www.carnivalsustainability.com, are developed in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines established by the Global Reporting Initiative, the global standard for reporting on environmental, social and governance policies, practices and performance. 
As part of our sustainability strategy, we have voluntarily reported our carbon footprint via the CDP (formerly, the Carbon Disclosure Project) each year since 2006. The CDP rates companies on the depth and scope of their disclosures and the quality of their reporting. We have developed a greenhouse gas inventory management plan in 2010 in accordance with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 14064-1:2006 standard and The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Our submission includes details of our most recently compiled emissions data and reduction efforts, along with the results of an independent, third-party verification of our greenhouse gas emissions inventory. We also disclose our water stewardship through the CDP water program. 
Carnival Corporation & plc's environmental management system is certified in accordance with the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System standard. 
We are committed to reducing our air emissions and improving air quality by evaluating established and new technology solutions. Liquefied natural gas is one of the solutions we are working to implement across our fleet both in port and at sea due to its reduced carbon profile and cleaner emissions. 
We continue our partnership with The Nature Conservancy, one of the world's leading conservation organizations, working across all sectors of industry and society to help advance its mission to protect the natural world and develop relationships that best align to produce clear conservation benefits with lasting, measurable outcomes. Our partnership is supporting their Mapping Ocean Wealth program, which creates maps that show the extent and distribution of benefits that habitats like coral reefs and mangroves provide, including fish production, flood mitigation, erosion control and recreation. 
ANNEX A 
We are tracking our progress against our 2020 sustainability goals, which reinforce our commitment to the environment, our guests, our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are pleased to share that through the commitment of our dedicated and diverse workforce, we reached our carbon reduction goal ahead of schedule and are determining our next target. We are currently defining our sustainability strategy beyond 2020 and are using the United Nations' 2030 sustainable development goals as a framework.

(1)  Greenhouse gas emission data collection and calculations were performed in accordance with our greenhouse gas inventory  management plan, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064-3:2006 standard. Ship fuel emissions represent over 95% of the combined scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled  by Carnival Corporation & plc) and scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam).  
(2)  We measure and report the ship fuel greenhouse gas emission rate in terms of grams of CO2e per available lower berth kilometer ("ALB-KM"). This indicator enables us to make meaningful greenhouse gas emission reduction comparisons that  take into account changes in fleet size, itineraries and passenger capacity.

Our corporate office and individual brands employ a variety of methods, such as intranet sites, management briefings, newsletters and reward programs to encourage employee involvement and to keep employees informed of the performance, development and progress of Carnival Corporation & plc. 
We believe that diversity and inclusion issues, such as the attraction, retention, development and promotion of women and people of color, are not only important topics in corporations and boardrooms world-wide, they are issues critically important to sustaining the success of our business. For years, we have partnered with organizations focused on improving the diversity and inclusiveness of work places and by extension, society in general. We strive to achieve greater performance through capturing the power of employee diversity across all elements such as race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Accordingly, our President and Chief Executive Officer has committed to Catalyst's "Catalyst CEO Champions for Change" initiative to support the advancement of women's leadership and diversity in the workplace and the Executive Leadership Council's "CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion" initiative to support and encourage diversity in the workplace.

Statement of Directors' Responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the group and company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as adopted by the European Union. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Carnival plc and the Carnival plc group and of the net income of the Carnival plc group for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements the Directors are required to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
• state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed for the group and company financial statements, subject to any  material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and  
• prepare the group and parent company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to  presume that the group and company will continue in business.  
[END TABLE]
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain Carnival plc's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of Carnival plc and the Carnival plc group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Carnival plc and the Carnival plc group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Proxy Statement, confirms that, to the best of his or her knowledge: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Carnival plc group and company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs give a true  and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and net income of the Carnival plc group and company; and

[END TABLE]
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for the shareholders of Carnival plc to assess the position and performance, business model and strategy of the Carnival plc group and company.

[END TABLE]
Certain information required to be included in the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is set forth in Part I (which is also known as the Compensation Discussion and Analysis) and in the "Director Compensation" and "Compensation Tables" sections of the Notice of Annual Meetings and Proxy Statement to which this Report is annexed (the "Proxy Statement"). The Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the relevant parts of the Proxy Statement should be read in conjunction with this Part II. 
As explained in Part I, Parts I and II of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report form part of the Carnival plc Annual Report for the year ended November 30, 2018. Carnival plc and Carnival Corporation are separate legal entities (together referred to as "Carnival Corporation & plc") and each company has its own Board of Directors and Compensation Committee. However, as required by the agreements governing the dual listed company ("DLC") arrangement, there is a single management team and the Boards of Directors and members of the Committees of the Boards are identical. Accordingly, consistent with prior years, we have included remuneration paid by Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. The Directors are primarily paid by Carnival Corporation as part of the DLC arrangement. 
Both Parts I and II of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report are in compliance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, as amended (the "LMCG Regulations") and the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in April 2016 (the "Corporate Governance Code"), the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.

The PBS grant made to Mr. Donald in fiscal 2018 is capable of vesting between zero to 200% of target based upon the extent to which operating income, as adjusted for certain fuel price changes and currency exchange rate  impacts, for each of the three fiscal years in the 2018-2020 performance cycle and the average of each annual return on invested capital ("ROIC") result for the three-year performance cycle exceeds the specified performance goals. Under  the terms of the grant, the operating income result is weighted 60% and ROIC result is weighted 40%. The operating income and ROIC targets will be disclosed at the end of the performance period (as these targets are deemed strategic and commercially  sensitive).   In April 2018, the Compensation Committees also  approved an SEA grant to Mr. Donald in the form of 35,000 target shares. The SEA grant is entirely performance-based and the ultimate value is contingent upon Carnival Corporation & plc's absolute TSR as modified by our TSR rank  relative to the Peer Group over the period of December 1, 2017 through November 30, 2020, which may be from zero to 600% of target.   The Compensation Committees approved the long-term equity grants to Mr. Donald after an evaluation of current market practice, the aggregate market  positioning of total direct compensation, and the Compensation Committees' focus on the alignment between Mr. Donald's pay outcomes and Carnival Corporation & plc's long-term performance.   The 2016 PBS grant made to Mr. Donald in April 2016 reached the  end of the performance period at the end of fiscal 2018 and will vest on February 15, 2019.

  2.2  Service Contracts (not audited)  
[END TABLE]
Because Directors, other than Mr. Donald, do not have formal agreements, it is not feasible to include a table with the unexpired terms. Mr. Donald's terms are summarized in the Proxy Statement. As explained more fully in the Proxy Statement, Mr. Donald would generally receive an amount equal to one times his base salary and target bonus upon termination. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed under terms set out in a letter of appointment. They do not have service contracts and their appointments can be terminated (by the Boards) without any compensation on termination. However, they may retain their share grants (if they have already served for at least one year) and may receive a departing gift of up to $25,000 in value.

  2.3  Compensation Committees (not audited)  
[END TABLE]
The membership of the Compensation Committees during the year consisted of three members who are deemed independent by the Boards of Directors: Randall J. Weisenburger (Chair), Richard J. Glasier and Laura Weil. The members of the Compensation Committees are appointed by the Boards based on the recommendations of the Nominating & Governance Committees. Further details 
ANNEX B 
regarding the Compensation Committees (including the number of meetings of the Compensation Committees held in fiscal 2018 and the attendance of the members at such meetings) can be found in the Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report attached as Annex C to the Proxy Statement. 
Details of the Compensation Committees' process for making compensation determinations, including the advice provided by internal colleagues and external advisors are set out in Part I. As stated in Part I, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (together with its UK affiliated firm, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP, which is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, the UK professional body, and complies with its code of conduct) were appointed by the Compensation Committees as their external advisors. The advisors were appointed following a tender process and are subject to an ongoing periodic review by the Compensation Committees of their independence and quality. They provide no other services to Carnival Corporation & plc and, accordingly, are considered independent by the Compensation Committees and to provide objective advice. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committees also engaged Willis Towers Watson to assist the Compensation Committees with the CEO Pay Ratio calculation and disclosure. 
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP and Willis Towers Watson have each provided their written consent to the form and content of their references in the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report and the Proxy Statement. 
Fees paid to the Compensation Committees' external advisors in fiscal 2018 were $400,862, such fees being charged on these firms' standard terms of business for advice provided.

ANNEX B 
Carnival Corporation & plc has a long-standing shareholder outreach program and routinely interacts with shareholders on a number of matters, including executive compensation. The Compensation Committees consider all constructive feedback received about executive compensation. 
In April 2018, shareholders approved our remuneration proposals. Following their review of the 2018 and prior voting results, the Compensation Committees decided that all compensation of Mr. Donald, other than base salary, pensions and benefits, will continue to be 100% at risk and performance-based. We continued to seek and incorporate shareholder feedback in our compensation deliberations. The Compensation Committees have and will continue to consider results from the annual shareholder advisory votes, including the next vote in April 2019, as well as other shareholder input, when reviewing executive compensation programs and policies.

(2)  Face values for all grants are calculated using the closing share prices at the relevant grant dates being: $68.52 at  January 16, 2018, $68.77 at February 12, 2018, $63.10 at April 10, 2018 and $63.64 at April 11, 2018.  
(3)  MTE grants have only pre-grant performance measures. SEA and PBS grants have  post-grant performance measures. These are described in Part I of the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report. Consistent with U.S. practice, these have been included at their target values. To comply with the LMCG Regulations, a column for  the maximum percentage (before dividend accrual) has been included and the UK face values should be taken as the reported figure multiplied by those percentages. Similarly, the threshold percentages are expressed as a percentage of target rather  than maximum. The performance period for the SEA grants is December 1, 2017-November 30, 2020 and the performance period for the PBS grants is fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020.

[END TABLE]
Details of Carnival Corporation & plc's stock ownership requirements for Executive Directors are set out in Part I. Messrs. Arison and Donald comply with the policy, which require each of them to own Carnival Corporation or Carnival plc shares with a value equivalent to six times his salary. 
The stock ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors provides that all Non-Executive Directors are required to own shares (inclusive of unvested restricted stock, RSUs and shares in a trust beneficially owned by the Director) of either Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares with a value equal to five times the cash retainer. New Directors must achieve this requirement no later than five years from the date of their initial election to the Boards by the shareholders. Other than Ms. Deeble and Mr. Cahilly, who were elected in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and Ms. Lahey, who was appointed in January 2019, each of the Non-Executive Directors has already achieved this Board-mandated requirement.

*  For consistency with Part I, the above table includes restricted stock (but not RSUs) held.  
**  As part of the establishment of the DLC arrangement, Carnival plc issued a special voting share to Carnival  Corporation, which transferred such share to the trustee of the P&O Princess Special Voting Trust (the "Trust"), a trust established under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Shares of beneficial interest in the Trust were transferred to  Carnival Corporation. The trust shares represent a beneficial interest in the Carnival plc special voting share. Immediately following the transfer, Carnival Corporation distributed such trust shares by way of a dividend to holders of shares of  common stock of Carnival Corporation. Under a pairing agreement, the trust shares are paired with, and evidenced by, certificates representing shares of Carnival Corporation common stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, under the pairing agreement, when a share of Carnival Corporation common stock is issued to a person after the implementation of the DLC arrangement, a paired trust share will  be issued at the same time to such person. Each share of Carnival Corporation common stock and the paired trust share may not be transferred separately. The Carnival Corporation common stock

[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance 
Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc (together referred to as "Carnival Corporation & plc") operate under a dual listed company ("DLC") arrangement with primary listings in the U.S. and the UK. Accordingly, Carnival Corporation & plc has implemented a single corporate governance framework consistent, to the extent possible, with the governance practices and requirements of both countries. Where there are customs or practices that differ between the two countries, Carnival Corporation & plc has nonetheless sought to be compliant with UK best practices whenever possible. Carnival Corporation & plc believes that their resulting corporate governance framework effectively addresses the corporate governance requirements of both the U.S. and the UK. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Carnival Corporation & plc has adopted corporate governance guidelines (the "Guidelines") that set forth the general governance principles approved by the Boards of Directors. The Guidelines are available on Carnival Corporation & plc's website and are summarized as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of the members of each of the Boards must be independent in accordance with the corporate governance rules  applicable to companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.  
• The Boards will each have at all times an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Health, Environmental,  Safety & Security ("HESS") Committee and a Nominating & Governance Committee (collectively, the "Committees"). All the members of the Committees will be independent Directors under the criteria applicable to  companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Each Committee has its own written charter, which principally sets forth the purposes, goals and responsibilities of the  Committees.  
• The Nominating & Governance Committees will review with the Boards, on an annual basis, the requisite skills  and characteristics of new Board members, as well as the composition of the Boards as a whole. The Nominating & Governance Committees will assess and recommend Board candidates for appointment as Directors.  
• The responsibilities of the Directors are laid out in the Guidelines and cover matters such as the Directors'  duties to Carnival Corporation & plc and its shareholders, attendance at meetings and the annual review of Carnival Corporation & plc's long-term strategic plans and the principal issues that Carnival Corporation &  plc may face in the future.  
• The Non-Executive Directors shall appoint a Senior Independent Director to  preside at meetings of the Non-Executive Directors and at Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman, and to serve as the principal liaison for Non-Executive  Directors.  
• Directors have free and full access to officers and employees of Carnival Corporation & plc, to the advice and  services of the Company Secretary to the Boards and to independent professional advice at the expense of Carnival Corporation & plc.  
• The Compensation Committees will recommend the form and amount of Director and senior executive compensation in  accordance with the policies and principles set forth in their charter and conduct an annual review thereof. In particular, the Compensation Committees will annually review the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and his performance to  enable the Chief Executive Officer to provide strong leadership for Carnival Corporation & plc in the short and long-term.

• The Boards and the Nominating & Governance Committees are responsible for Chief Executive Officer and board  succession planning.  
• The Nominating & Governance Committees will maintain orientation programs for new Directors and continuing  education programs for all Directors.  
• The Boards will conduct an annual performance evaluation to determine whether they, their Committees and individual  Directors are functioning effectively.  
• The Non-Executive Directors will meet at least annually under the direction of  the Senior Independent Director to conduct an appraisal of the Chairman's performance.  
• All shareholders may communicate with the Boards by addressing all communications to the Company Secretary, who must  forward any item requiring immediate attention to the Senior Independent Director, who must in turn notify the Boards of any matters for discussion or action as appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
Carnival Corporation & plc monitors governance developments in the U.S. and the UK to support a vigorous and effective corporate governance framework. 
Set out below is a statement of how Carnival Corporation & plc has applied the main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in April 2016 (the "Corporate Governance Code") during the year ended November 30, 2018. A copy of the Corporate Governance Code is available on the website of the UK Financial Reporting Council at www.frc.org.uk. The requirements of rule 7.2.6R of the UK Listing Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules sourcebook can be found in the Carnival plc Directors' Report attached as Annex A to the Proxy Statement. 
Board Composition 
Each of the Boards of Directors is currently comprised of 12 members, of which two are Executive Directors and 10 are Non-Executive Directors. Except for Katie Lahey, who was appointed to the Boards in January 2019, each member of the Boards has served for the full year. All Directors are required to submit themselves for annual re-election. The biographical details of the members of the Boards standing for election or re-election and their qualifications to serve as Board and Committee members are contained in the Proxy Statement. All Directors elected in 2017 have been subject to a formal performance evaluation during the year, as described below. 
As of the date of this Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report, 33% of the members of the Boards are women (being four of 12 members). 
Board Balance and Independence 
As part of the Boards' annual independence assessment, each Director was required to complete an independence questionnaire. All questionnaires were reviewed and assessed by the full Board. Following this review, all of the 10 nominees for election or re-election as Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Boards to be independent in accordance with the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. Richard J. Glasier, Sir John Parker, Stuart Subotnick, Laura Weil and Randall J. Weisenburger have been Non-Executive Directors for more than nine years from the date of their first election to the Boards. However, notwithstanding this fact, the Boards have determined that each of those Directors is independent for the reasons set forth below. 
Consistent with U.S. practice, the Boards believe that length of tenure should be only one of the factors considered with respect to the independence of Directors and, accordingly, that tenure alone should not result in the loss of independence. The Boards believe that automatic loss of independence status for Directors due to tenure would effectively operate as a term limit for independent Directors and result 
ANNEX C 
in the loss of the valuable contributions of Directors who have been able to develop, over time, increasing insight into Carnival Corporation & plc and its operations. The Boards prefer to rely on rigorous annual evaluations of individual Directors to review their objectivity and independence, as well as their overall effectiveness as Directors. All Directors are also subject to annual re-election by shareholders following individual evaluations and recommendations by the Nominating & Governance Committees.

As at the date of this Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report, indemnities are in force under which Carnival Corporation & plc has agreed to indemnify the Directors of Carnival Corporation & plc, to the extent permitted by law and the Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Carnival Corporation and the Articles of Association of Carnival plc, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities, as Directors of Carnival plc. Carnival Corporation & plc maintains insurance to indemnify the Directors when it is unable to do so due to insolvency or as a result of a derivative suit. 
Board Procedures and Responsibilities 
Meetings of the Boards are held on a regular basis to enable the Boards to properly discharge their responsibilities. During the year ended November 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of Carnival plc held a total of six meetings. All Board meetings during the year were attended by the full Board except for Helen Deeble who attended five of six meetings, having missed one meeting due to a family emergency, and Sir John Parker and Stuart Subotnick who each attended five of six meetings, having missed one meeting due to illness. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors meet periodically during the year with the Chairman of the Boards with no other Executive Directors present. The agenda for each Board meeting and meeting schedules are prepared by the Chairman and reviewed and approved by the Senior Independent Director, to enable the flow of relevant information to the Boards. Each Board member is entitled to suggest the inclusion of items on the agenda and to raise at any Board meetings subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. 
In 2006, the Boards created a program to provide Directors with direct knowledge and contact with our operating groups and their respective management teams. Each year, the Senior Independent Director assigns Directors to one of the four teams ("Director Teams") designated for our operating groups. Each Director Team meets with senior management of their assigned operating group at its headquarters for intensive operational and strategy meetings and to tour local facilities. The Directors are rotated among the Director Teams annually to ensure exposure to all of the operating units. 
Non-Executive Directors are required to allocate sufficient time to meet the expectations of their role. The consent of the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director must be sought before accepting additional directorships that might affect the time a Non-Executive Director of Carnival Corporation & plc is able to devote to that role. 
The Boards have resolved that Executive Directors may not serve as a Non-Executive Board member on more than one FTSE 100 or Fortune 100 company nor as the Chair of such a company. 
Board Structures and Delegation to Management 
The basic responsibility of the Directors is to exercise their business judgment in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of Carnival Corporation & plc and for the benefit of the shareholders as a whole. Further details of the responsibilities of the Directors are

The strategic management and direction of, and significant commercial decisions in relation to, global operations of Carnival Corporation & plc, except to the extent reserved to the full Boards under their schedule of reserved matters, is delegated by the Boards to the Boards of subsidiary companies within the group and to management committees of the Boards, which in turn delegate to local management as appropriate. 
Committees of the Boards 
The following Committees have operated throughout the year. Each Committee has a written charter, copies of which can be found on Carnival Corporation & plc's website at www.carnivalcorp.com or www.carnivalplc.com. 
Audit Committees 
During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committees of the Boards were comprised of the following five independent Non-Executive Directors: Richard J.

ANNEX C 
Sir John Parker and Randall J. Weisenburger. The qualifications of each member of the Nominating & Governance Committees are contained in the Proxy Statement.

Carnival plc Supplement to the Report of the Audit Committees 
Certain information required to be included in the Carnival plc Report of the Audit Committee is set forth in the Report of the Audit Committees included in the Proxy Statement, and which is incorporated by reference into this Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report. The principal purpose of this Carnival plc Supplement to the Report of the Audit Committees is to comply with the Corporate Governance Code requirements, which are only applicable to Carnival plc. 
Significant Accounting Judgments 
The significant areas considered by the Carnival plc Audit Committee and discussed with the Carnival plc external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), for fiscal 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Impairment Reviews of AIDA Cruises ("AIDA"), Costa Cruises ("Costa") and Cunard Goodwill: The  Audit Committee considered whether the carrying value of AIDA's goodwill held by Carnival plc should be impaired. The judgment in relation to the impairment assessments largely relates to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the fair  value less the cost of disposal. The Audit Committee evaluated the key assumptions related to net revenue yields, net cruise costs (including fuel prices), capacity changes, weighted-average cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The Audit  Committee performed this evaluation using reports received from management outlining the basis for assumptions used, including the strategic plan and sensitivity analysis. The Audit Committee performed this evaluation through inquiries with  management. The Audit Committee determined that these key assumptions were reasonable and these brands' goodwill was not impaired as of July 31, 2018 and that appropriate disclosures have been made in the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS  financial statements (see Note 11).  
• Impairment Reviews of Certain Ships. The Audit Committee considered whether the carrying value of certain ships  may be impaired. The judgment in relation to impairment largely relates to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the ship being tested for impairment, primarily whether the strategic plan for these ships is achievable and  the overall macroeconomic assumptions that underpin the valuation process. The Audit Committee evaluated the key

[BEGIN TABLE]

ANNEX C 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   assumptions related to net revenue yields, net cruise costs, including fuel prices, life of these ships, estimated sale proceeds and  sale date and changes in strategy, including decisions about the transfer of ships between brands. The Audit Committee addressed these matters using reports received from management outlining the basis for assumptions used, including the strategic  plan and sensitivity analysis. The strategic plan for these ships used in the calculation was reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee determined these key assumptions were reasonable, these ships were not impaired and that appropriate  disclosures have been made in the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements (see Note 10).  
• Risks of Fraud in Relation to Revenue Recognition. The Audit Committee considered the presumed risks of fraud as  defined by auditing standards and was satisfied that there were no significant issues.  
[END TABLE]
External Auditors and Audit Tendering 
The Audit Committees have the responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors. PwC was recommended by the Audit Committees for reappointment as auditors of Carnival plc at the Annual General Meeting held in April 2018, and reappointment was approved by the shareholders. The Audit Committees also reappointed PwC as Carnival Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, as ratified by the shareholders at the April 2018 Annual General Meeting. In addition, the policy of the Audit Committees is to undertake a formal assessment of the auditor's objectivity and independence each year, which includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a review of non-audit services provided and related fees;  
• discussion with the auditors pertaining to a written report detailing all relationships with Carnival  Corporation & plc and any other party that could affect the independence or the objectivity of the auditors; and  
• evaluation with the Boards and management of the effectiveness of the external audit process.  
[END TABLE]
PwC has served as Carnival Corporation's independent auditor from 1986 to 2002. In 2003, following formation of the DLC arrangement between Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, the independent audits for the consolidated entity, Carnival Corporation & plc, and Carnival plc were tendered. Deloitte & Touche LLP, KPMG LLP and PwC participated in these tenders. Upon completion of this tender process, the Audit Committees decided to recommend to the shareholders that PwC be appointed as the Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc independent auditors for fiscal 2003. The Audit Committees annually evaluate PwC's performance and have each year recommended that the shareholders vote for the reappointment of PwC as Carnival plc's independent auditors. 
Carnival plc is also subject to European Union ("EU") regulations regarding this matter. The relevant EU regulation and UK implementing legislation (the Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016) require statutory auditors to rotate after a period of 20 years and include a mandatory competitive tender of audit firms at the 10 year midpoint. The EU regulation, Statutory Auditors and Third Country Auditors Regulations 2016 and the Competition and Market Authority's ("CMA") Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the "CMA Order") also set out transitional rules that determine the latest date for the initial rotation or tender process. PwC has been Carnival plc's auditor since fiscal 2003, so the transitional rules state that they may not be reappointed more than nine years after June 2014, effectively meaning that the audit firm must be changed for the fiscal 2024 audit at the latest. 
As a result, the Audit Committees currently intend to tender the independent audits for the consolidated entity, Carnival Corporation & plc, and Carnival plc in 2022 for the 2024 audits. 
ANNEX C 
Our reasons for not putting the audits out for tender until 2022 for the fiscal 2024 audits and for recommending that PwC be appointed Carnival plc's auditor for 2019 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC is one of the largest independent audit firms in the world. In addition, PwC is uniquely qualified because they are  the auditors of the three largest public cruise companies in the world, which comprise over 75% of the global cruise industry. As such, it has an exceptional level of understanding of the cruise industry, the significant accounting principles used  by it and the economic environment in which it operates.  
• Carnival Corporation & plc has periodically undertaken internal surveys to confirm PwC's qualifications  and performance, the quality and candor of their communication with the Audit Committees and management and their independence, objectivity and professional skepticism. The results of these surveys have supported the Audit Committees' and  management's recommendations to appoint PwC as the independent auditors of Carnival Corporation & plc and Carnival plc.  
• PwC's lead audit engagement partner for Carnival Corporation & plc and the engagement partner for Carnival  plc are rotated from the engagement at least every five years. The PwC engagement partners working on subsidiaries are rotated from these engagements at least every seven years or in the case of significant EU subsidiaries, for the periods beginning  on or after June 17, 2016, the engagement partners will be rotated at least every five years. The Audit Committees actively participate in the selection of the lead audit engagement partners. The Audit Committees and management believe the  partner rotations support an independent auditor view of our operations and provide fresh insights into the audit processes.  
• The Audit Committees meet regularly with PwC in executive sessions, where management is not present. These executive  sessions, which are not required under UK or U.S. regulations, further support PwC's independence from management.  
• The Audit Committees' Key Policies and Procedures establish a framework to monitor and maintain PwC's  independence. These Key Policies and Procedures require, among other things, pre-approval from the Audit Committees for audit and permissible non-audit services prior to  the performance of any such services in accordance with UK and U.S. regulations. The Audit Committees only approve services to be provided by PwC that are consistent with these regulations, which helps to support auditor independence.   
• The communication between the Audit Committees and PwC has been timely and informative, which has assisted the Audit  Committees in the performance of their oversight responsibilities.  
• The Audit Committees and management believe that PwC has performed the audits of Carnival Corporation & plc and  Carnival plc with proper professional skepticism and demonstrated the necessary knowledge, experience and skills to meet their audit requirements.  
• Based on the review and analysis of audit fees of comparable public companies, the Audit Committees and management  believe the PwC audit fees are competitive.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committees continue to be confident that the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors is not impaired in any way. There are no contractual restrictions on the choice of external auditor and, therefore, a resolution proposing the reappointment of PwC as external auditors will be put to the Carnival plc shareholders at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. 
The fees payable to PwC in respect of the audit and non-audit services provided to Carnival plc during fiscal 2018 were $1.7 million and $0.1, respectively. The policy on Audit Committee pre-approval and permissible non-audit work of the independent auditors, are set out in the "Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm," section of the Proxy Statement, which is incorporated by reference into this Carnival plc Corporate Governance Report. 
The CMA Order applies to FTSE 350 companies. Carnival plc confirms that it complied with the provisions of the CMA Order in fiscal 2018.

ANNEX C 
UK Financial Reporting Council Audit Quality Review 
During fiscal 2018, the 2017 external audit of Carnival plc by PwC was reviewed by the UK Financial Reporting Council Audit Quality Review team. The Audit Quality Review team routinely monitors the quality of audit work of certain UK audit firms through inspections of sample audits and related procedures at those audit firms. As part of the process, the Chairman of the Audit Committee had a discussion with a representative from the Audit Quality Review team and provided feedback at the end of the review to the other members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee and PwC have discussed the outcome of the review, noting there were no findings or changes to the 2018 audit approach resulting from the inspection. The outcome of the review provided us with assurance as to the quality of the audit performed by PwC.

Information and Professional Development 
The Company Secretary is required to provide members of the Boards with appropriate information in advance of each meeting and Directors are required to devote adequate preparation time reviewing this information in advance of each meeting. The Company Secretary is also responsible for advising the Boards through the Chairman on all corporate governance matters. 
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and are permitted to obtain independent professional advice, at Carnival Corporation & plc's expense, as he or she may deem necessary to discharge his or her responsibilities as a Director. A Director is required to inform the Senior Independent Director of his or her intention to do so. 
Directors are offered the opportunity to attend training programs of their choice. The subject matter and content of such programs are reviewed periodically during the year. 
Board Performance Evaluations 
During fiscal 2018, the Nominating & Governance Committees conducted performance evaluations of the Boards, the Boards' Committees and the members of our Boards of Directors. The performance review of Micky Arison, in his role as Chairman, was conducted separately by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the then Senior Independent Director, Randall J. Weisenburger, taking into account the view of the other Executive Director. 
As part of the Boards' evaluation exercise, each Director was required to complete a questionnaire about the performance of the Boards and their Committees. All questionnaires were reviewed and assessed by the Nominating & Governance Committees. 
ANNEX C 
In addition, the Nominating & Governance Committees reviewed the individual performance of each Director focusing on his or her contribution to Carnival Corporation & plc, and specifically focusing on areas of potential improvement. In making their assessment, the Nominating & Governance Committees reviewed considerations of age, diversity, experience and skills in the context of the needs of the Boards, and with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance on the Boards. 
The Nominating & Governance Committees also discussed and reviewed with Non-Executive Directors any significant time commitments they have with other companies or organizations. In addition, the number of directorships held by Non-Executive Directors was taken into account, in line with Carnival Corporation & plc's policy on limiting multiple appointments. 
The Nominating & Governance Committees reported the results of the reviews to the Boards, concluding that each Director was an effective member of the Boards and had sufficient time to carry out properly their respective commitments to the Boards, their Committees and all other such duties as were required of them. It is the view of the Nominating & Governance Committees that the Boards continued to operate effectively during fiscal 2018. 
During fiscal 2018, the Nominating & Governance Committees also reviewed their own performance against their respective charters by completing questionnaires that were provided to the Chair of the Nominating & Governance Committees. The results of such reviews were discussed among the members and reported to the Boards. The Boards concluded that the Nominating & Governance Committees continued to function effectively and continued to meet the requirements of their respective charters. 
The Corporate Governance Code requires that an externally facilitated evaluation on the Board's effectiveness be undertaken at least once every third year. During fiscal 2016, the Nominating & Governance Committees engaged The Governance Solutions Group, an independent third-party governance expert which has no other connection with Carnival Corporation & plc, to perform an assessment of the effectiveness of the Boards. The third-party governance expert interviewed each Director elected in 2016 and members of senior management who interact substantially with the Board, reviewed the results of the assessment with the incumbent Senior Independent Director and then organized and summarized the assessment for discussion with the full Board. 
Directors' Remuneration 
The Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report is presented in two parts, with Part I forming part of the Proxy Statement and Part II being attached as Annex B to the Proxy Statement. A resolution to approve the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report will be proposed at the 2019 Annual General Meeting. 
Relations with Shareholders 
The formal channels of communication by which the Boards communicate to shareholders the overall performance of Carnival Corporation & plc are the Annual Reports, Carnival plc half yearly financial report, joint Annual Report on Form 10-K, joint Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, joint Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statement and press releases. 
Senior management and Non-Executive Directors of Carnival Corporation & plc meet periodically with representatives of institutional shareholders to discuss their views and to enable the strategies and objectives of Carnival Corporation & plc to be well understood. Issues discussed with institutional shareholders include executive compensation, performance, business strategies and any corporate governance concerns.

ANNEX C 
Presentations are made to representatives of the investment community periodically in the U.S., the UK and elsewhere. Results of each fiscal quarter are reviewed with the investment community and others following each quarter on conference calls that are broadcast live over the Internet. 
The Boards receive periodic briefings from management regarding feedback and information obtained from Carnival Corporation & plc's shareholders and brokers. During fiscal 2018, Carnival Corporation & plc's management made presentations to the Boards regarding shareholder issues. The Boards' members were also provided with copies of reports prepared by key market analysts. 
Shareholders will have the opportunity at the 2019 Annual General Meeting, notice of which is contained in the Proxy Statement, to put questions to the Boards, including the Chairs of the Committees of the Boards. 
The Boards have implemented procedures to facilitate communications between shareholders or interested parties and the Boards. Shareholders or interested parties who wish to communicate with the boards or the Senior Independent Director should address their communications to the attention of the Company Secretary of Carnival Corporation & plc at 3655 N.W. 87th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33178-2428 United States of America. The Company Secretary promptly forwards to the Senior Independent Director those communications which the Company Secretary believes require immediate attention. The Senior Independent Director notifies the Boards or the Chair of the relevant Committees of the Boards of those matters that he believes are appropriate for further action or discussion. 
Annual Meetings of Shareholders 
Because we have shareholders in both the UK and the U.S., we rotate the location of the Annual Meetings between the UK and the U.S. each year in order to accommodate shareholders on both sides of the Atlantic. Last year we held our Annual Meetings in the U.S., and this year we will be holding them in the UK. 
This year the Annual Meetings will be held at Mandarin Oriental Hotel – Ballroom Entrance, 66 Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7LA, United Kingdom on Tuesday, April 16, 2019. The meetings will commence at 9:30 a.m. (BST), and although technically two separate meetings (the Carnival plc meeting will begin first), shareholders of Carnival Corporation may attend the Carnival plc meeting and vice-versa. 
We are also offering an audio replay of the business portion of the Annual Meetings, which will be available shortly after the meetings at www.carnivalcorp.com or www.carnivalplc.com. 
Internal control and risk management 
A description of the Carnival Corporation & plc internal controls and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process can be found in the Strategic Report that accompanies the Carnival plc consolidated IFRS financial statements under section 3. Internal Control and Risk Assessment. 
Directors' Responsibility for Financial Statements 
The Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in relation to the Carnival plc financial statements is included in the Carnival plc Directors' Report attached as Annex A to the Proxy Statement. 
ANNEX C 
Statement of Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code 
Carnival Corporation & plc has applied the main principles of the Corporate Governance Code and complied with its provisions throughout the year ended November 30, 2018, with the following exception: annual bonuses of U.S. Executive Directors form part of their pensionable salary (which is explained in the Carnival plc Directors' Remuneration Report attached as Annex B to the Proxy Statement).
