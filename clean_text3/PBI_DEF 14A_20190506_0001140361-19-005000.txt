[END TABLE]
  Proposal 3: Non-binding Advisory Vote to Approve Executive CompensationThe vote to approve executive compensation is an advisory vote and the results will not be binding on the board of directors or the Company. The board of directors will review the results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Broker non-votes and abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will not be counted either for or against. As a result, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the advisory vote to approve executive compensation.Proposal 4: Approval of the Amended and Restated Pitney Bowes Inc. 2018 Stock Plan Broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and therefore will not be counted either for or against this proposal. With respect to abstentions, for purposes of approval under our By-laws, abstentions are not considered votes cast and therefore will not be counted either for or against; however, for purposes of approval under New York Stock Exchange rules, abstentions are treated as votes cast, and, therefore, will have the same effect as an "against" vote. How do Dividend Reinvestment Plan participants or employees with shares in the 401(k) plans vote by proxy?If you are a registered stockholder and participate in our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, or our employee 401(k) plans, your proxy includes the number of shares acquired through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and/or credited to your 401(k) plan account.Shares held in our 401(k) plans are voted by the plan trustee in accordance with voting instructions received from plan participants. The plans direct the trustee to vote shares for which no instructions are received in the same proportion (for, against or abstain) indicated by the voting instructions given by participants in the plans.Who will count the votes?Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

Also, under our By-laws, a stockholder can present other business at an annual meeting, including the nomination of candidates for director, only if written notice of the business or candidates is received by the Corporate Secretary no earlier than the close of business on January 7, 2020 and no later than the close of business on February 6, 2020. However, in the event that the date of the 2020 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary of our 2019 annual meeting, then the stockholders notice must be delivered no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the meeting and no later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such meeting, the 10th day after the first public announcement of the meeting date. There are other procedural requirements in the By-laws pertaining to stockholder proposals and director nominations. The By-laws are posted on our Corporate Governance website at www.pitneybowes.com under the caption Our Company—Our Leadership & Governance—Corporate Governance. If notice of a matter is not received within the applicable deadlines or does not comply with the By-laws, the chairman of the meeting may refuse to introduce such matter.

The multifaceted nature of this program allows us to maintain meaningful engagement with a broad audience including large institutional investors, smaller to mid-size institutions, pension funds, advisory firms, and individual investors. In the spring of 2018, we reached out to stockholders representing approximately 50% of outstanding company shares, and in the fall 2018, we reached out to stockholders representing approximately 50% of outstanding company shares. We value the feedback we receive concerning the board's leadership structure, governance practices, the company's proxy statement, and emerging governance and executive compensation. With those stockholders who responded to our invitation in 2018, we discussed corporate governance practices, executive compensation policies and our approach to the board's role in risk mitigation oversight, including its oversight of our cybersecurity efforts and board composition. Our investors generally have provided positive feedback on these topics. Refer to section Stockholder Engagement—Executive Compensation on page 45 for further details regarding Investor Outreach.

 Key Corporate Governance Practices Enhancing the Board's Independent  Leadership, Accountability and Oversight  
• Separate Chairman and CEO. Our Governance Principles include well-defined responsibilities, qualifications and selection criteria with respect to the Chairman role. The board has appointed Michael I. Roth, an independent director, as Non-Executive Chairman. In addition to chairing the Executive and Finance Committees, Mr. Roth is a member of the Audit Committee and attends most of the other board committee meetings as well.  
• Independent Committees. The board of directors has determined that all board committees, other than the Executive Committee, should consist entirely of independent directors.  
• Executive Sessions. Our independent directors meet without the CEO or other members of management to discuss issues, including matters concerning management. The Non-Executive Chairman presides at these executive sessions.  
• Majority Voting in Director Elections. Our By-laws provide that in uncontested elections, director nominees must be elected by a majority of the votes cast.  
• Annual Election of Directors. Our By-laws provide that our stockholders elect all directors annually.  
• Stock Holding Requirements. Within five years of becoming a director, each board member is expected to accumulate and hold company common stock having a minimum aggregate market value of five times the annual base cash retainer.  
• No Hedging or Pledging. Directors may not pledge or transfer for value Pitney Bowes securities, engage in short-term speculative (in and out) trading in Pitney Bowes securities, or participate in hedging and other derivative transactions, including short sales, put or call options, swaps, collars or similar derivative transactions, with respect to Pitney Bowes securities.  
• Annual Assessments. Every year, the full board, as well as each board committee, conducts a self-assessment to evaluate all aspects of the board or board committee, including the members of the board and the board's leadership. Each committee as well as the full board reviews and discusses the self-assessments and implements any appropriate action. In some years, the board engages a third party advisor for assistance in the self-assessment, as it did in 2016. The third-party advisor provides feedback in separate discussions with the full board and the Governance Committee as well as in individual discussions with the Chairman and with the Chair of the Governance Committee.

attends most of the meetings of the two committees on which he is not a member. Mr. Roth is also actively involved as an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer through frequent conversations, bringing to bear his experiences as a CEO and his experiences from his service on other boards.The board of directors has established well-defined responsibilities, qualifications and selection criteria with respect to the Chairman role. This information is set forth in detail in the Governance Principles of the Board of Directors, which can be found on our website at www.pitneybowes.com under the caption Our Company—Our Leadership & Governance—Corporate Governance. Company—Our Leadership & Governance—Corporate Governance, include additional information about succession planning.Periodically, but not less than annually, the board of directors considers managements recommendations concerning succession planning for senior management roles other than the role of CEO. As part of this process, the board reviews development plans to strengthen and supplement the skills and qualifications of internal succession candidates.As a result of these processes, the company announced several senior management changes in 2018. These are discussed in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A) section beginning on page 39.
longer term. To achieve this goal, the Governance Committee will focus on the range, median, and mean tenures of the board to go along with other factors it considers in its board turnover. The Governance Committee will also consider factors such as board size and the advisability of overlapping terms for board members leaving or joining the board. These will be in addition to the Governance Committee's consideration of each director's skills and the skills of the collective board, each director's contribution to the board, diversity and the company's long-term strategy and business needs. The Governance Committee will conduct this review on an annual basis.Consistent with this approach and their own individual circumstances, three current directors have decided not to stand for re-election this year: Linda Alvarado, Eduardo Menascé and David Snow. The board appreciates the leadership and strategic vision they have provided the company over the course of their respective tenures on the board. In addition, the board added two directors last year, Mary J. Steele Guilfoile, who has expertise in the area of financial services and retail banking as well as experience as a member of other public company audit committees, and Robert M. Dutkowsky, who has experience in the areas of technology as a recent CEO and Board Chairman, and expertise in running and operating a business. Ms. Guilfoile and Mr. Dutkowsky were brought to the attention of the Governance Committee by a non-management Director or the CEO. After being interviewed by various members of the board and Governance Committee, Ms. Guilfoile and Mr. Dutkowsky were appointed to the board in July 2018. As of the 2018 Annual Meeting, our average board tenure was 13 years. Upon the election of the proposed slate of directors, and in light of the additions of Ms. Guilfoile and Mr. Dutkowsky to the board and the fact that Ms. Alvarado, Mr. Menascé and Mr. Snow are not standing for re-election, the average board tenure will be 9 years. The board reviewed its size and determined that a board of 10 members is appropriate at this time. That change will become effective at the time of the Annual Meeting. Executive Compensation Committee reviews risk analyses relating to the company's compensation programs. With respect to cybersecurity, management, (comprised of members from multiple disciplines in the company, including Information Technology, Research and Development, Legal, Privacy, and Internal Audit) provides a detailed overview first to the Audit Committee and then again to the full board of the company's cybersecurity efforts and management of that risk. Under its Charter, the Audit Committee has oversight of the enterprise risks relating to Information Technology function generally, and cybersecurity in particular.Each enterprise risk and its related mitigation plan is reviewed by either the board of directors or the designated board committee on an annual basis. On an annual basis, the board of directors receives a report on the status of all enterprise risks and their related mitigation plans.Management monitors the risks and determines, from time to time, whether new risks should be considered either due to changes in the external environment, changes in the company's business, or for other reasons. Management also determines whether previously identified risks should be combined with new or emerging risks.In addition to the formal components of the enterprise risk management program, management explicitly discusses risks with the board within the context of other topics, such as the company's and individual unit strategies and specific aspects of the company's current transformation efforts.
current or past employment with Pitney Bowes or its independent accountants.Based upon its review, the board of directors has concluded in its business judgment that the following directors are independent: Linda G. Alvarado, Anne M. Busquet, Robert M. Dutkowsky, Roger Fradin, Anne Sutherland Fuchs, Mary J. Steele Guilfoile, S. Douglas Hutcheson, Eduardo R. Menascé, Michael I. Roth, Linda S. Sanford, David L. Shedlarz, and David B. Snow, Jr.Marc B. Lautenbach is not independent because he is a Pitney Bowes executive officer.

Plan, was last revised and approved by the stockholders effective in May 2014. At that time, the Governance Committee retained an independent compensation consultant with no other company business, Farient Advisors, to assist in its review of the director compensation program.The Governance Committee targets director compensation to be at approximately the 50th percentile of the total compensation in the peer and broader benchmark groups and used that benchmark in establishing the 2014 compensation levels.

 Report of the Audit Committee  
 The Audit Committee functions pursuant to a charter that is reviewed annually and was last amended in November 2016. The committee represents and assists the board of directors in overseeing the financial reporting process and the integrity of the company's financial statements. The Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and retention of the independent accountants, pre-approving the services they will perform, selecting the lead engagement partner, and for reviewing the performance of the independent accountants and the company's internal audit function. The board of directors, in its business judgment, has determined that all six of the members of the committee are "independent," as required by applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Four of the six members of the Committee have the requisite experience to be designated as an Audit Committee financial expert as defined by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
 In the performance of its responsibilities, the committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent accountants. The Committee has also discussed with the independent accountants the matters required to be discussed under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). Finally, the committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountants their independence.  
 In determining whether to recommend that the stockholders ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as Pitney Bowes' independent accountants for 2019, management and the committee, as they have done in prior years, engaged in a review of PricewaterhouseCoopers. In that review, the committee considers the continued independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers, its geographic presence compared to that of Pitney Bowes, its industry knowledge, the quality of the audit and its services, the audit approach and supporting technology, any Securities and Exchange Commission actions and other legal issues as well as PCAOB inspection reports. Pitney Bowes management prepares an annual assessment that includes an analysis of (1) the above criteria for PricewaterhouseCoopers and the other "Big Four" accounting firms; (2) an assessment of whether firms outside of the "Big Four" should be considered; and (3) a detailed analysis of the PricewaterhouseCoopers' fees. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers reviews with the Committee its analysis of its independence. Based on the results of this review this year, the Committee concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers is independent and that it is in the best interests of Pitney Bowes and its investors to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers, who have been independent accountants of the company since 1934, to serve as Pitney Bowes' independent registered accounting firm for 2019.  
 Based upon the review of information received and discussions as described in this report, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2019.

The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures to pre-approve all services to be performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Specifically the Committee's policy requires pre-approval of the use of PricewaterhouseCoopers for audit services as well as detailed, specific types of services within the following categories of audit-related and non-audit services: merger and acquisition due diligence and audit services; employee benefit plan audits; tax services; procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements; assessment of and making recommendations for improvement in internal accounting controls and selected related advisory services. The Audit Committee delegates to its Chairman the authority to address requests for pre-approval services between Audit Committee meetings, if it is deemed necessary to commence the service before the next scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee. Such pre-approval decisions are discussed at the next scheduled meeting. The Committee will not approve any service prohibited by regulation or for services which, in their opinion, may impair PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence. In each case, the Committee's policy is to pre-approve a specific annual budget by category for such audit, audit-related and tax services which the company anticipates obtaining from PricewaterhouseCoopers, and has required management to report the actual fees (versus budgeted fees) to the Committee on a periodic basis throughout the year. In addition, any new, unbudgeted engagement for audit services or within one of the other pre-approved categories described above must be pre-approved by the Committee or its chair.

Although it has not been the company's past practice to grant dividend equivalents, PSUs may be granted together with related dividend equivalent rights. If granted, dividend equivalents are prohibited from being paid until the underlying award has vested. Restricted Stock and Stock Units A restricted stock award represents shares of Pitney Bowes common stock that are issued subject to restrictions on transfer and vesting requirements as determined by the Committee. A RSU provides the employee the right to receive a payment in common stock or cash based on the value of a share of Pitney Bowes common stock. Both restricted stock and RSUs may be subject to such vesting requirements, restrictions and conditions to payment as the Committee determines are appropriate. Generally, we issue performance-based, time-vested restricted stock and RSU awards which vest pro-rata business performance goals established by the Committee or both. Generally vesting of stock options occurs pro-rata over a three-year period (pro-rata vesting will not occur prior to the first year anniversary from the grant date). Under certain circumstances, the Committee may accelerate the vesting of options.With certain exceptions, a vested stock option expires three months after termination of employment.Stock Appreciation Rights SARs entitle the employee, upon settlement, to receive a payment based on the excess of the fair market value of a share of Pitney Bowes common stock on the date of settlement over the base price of the right, multiplied by the applicable number of SARs of Pitney Bowes common stock. SARs may be granted on a stand-alone basis or in tandem with a related stock option. The base price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of Pitney Bowes common stock on the date of grant. The Committee will determine the vesting requirements, form of payment and other terms of a SAR, including the effect of termination of service of an employee. Vesting may be based on the continued service of the employee for specified time periods or on the attainment of specified business performance goals established by the Committee or both. Under certain circumstances, the Committee may accelerate the vesting of SARs. Generally, all SARs have a ten-year term from the date of the grant. SARs may be payable in cash or in shares of Pitney Bowes common stock or in a combination of both. The company does not currently have any SARs outstanding. Other Stock Based AwardsThe Committee may grant employees such other awards denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, shares of Pitney Bowes common stock (including without limitation securities convertible into such shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the Plan.

On February 5, 2019, the date of the 2019 award grants, the closing price of our common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange was $6.60 per share and as of March 8, 2019 (the record date) the closing price of our common stock was $6.56 per share. 
company's intent to have such award comply with the rules promulgated under Section 409A.Tax WithholdingTo the extent required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law, an employee will be required to satisfy, in a manner satisfactory to the company, any withholding tax obligations that arise by reason of the award.Taxation of the Various Plan AwardsPerformance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units. Employees granted RSUs and PSUs do not recognize income at the time of the grant. Rather they recognize ordinary income, and subject to IRC 162(m), the company receives a corresponding tax deduction, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the units when the award vests and is converted into common stock or paid in cash. Certain employees who receive PSUs or RSUs may defer the conversion of the PSUs or RSUs beyond the award vesting date.Nonqualified Stock Options. An employee will not recognize income and the company will not be entitled to a deduction upon receipt of a NSO award. Ordinary income will be realized by the employee, and subject to IRC 162(m), a tax deduction will be recognized by the company at the time the non-qualified stock option is exercised and the shares are transferred to the employee. The amount of such taxable income and deduction upon the exercise of an Option, is the difference between the exercise or option price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise.Incentive Stock Options. ISOs will not result in taxable income to the employee, nor a taxable deduction for the company. However, the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the option exercise price is a tax preference item that may subject the employee to the alternative minimum tax. If the employee holds the ISO shares for two years from the date the option was granted and for one year after the removed or have expired and the stock vests. The amount of ordinary income will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date that the restrictions on transfer are removed or have expired. Subject to 162(m), the company will be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the ordinary income the employee realizes. An employee may elect to recognize taxable ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time the award is received if the employee makes an election no later than 30 days after an employee receives the restricted stock. If a timely election is made, the employee will not recognize any additional income when the restrictions on the shares lapse. If the employee forfeits the shares to the company, the employee may not claim a deduction with respect to the income recognized as a result of the election.Generally, when an employee disposes of shares acquired under the Plan, the difference between the sales price and his or her basis in such shares will be treated as long- or short-term capital gain or loss depending upon the holding period for the shares.Registration with the SECIf the Amended and Restated Pitney Bowes Inc. 2018 Stock Plan is approved by shareholders, the company will file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the SEC with respect to the additional shares of Pitney Bowes common stock to be registered pursuant to the Amended and Restated Pitney Bowes Inc. 2018 Stock Plan, as soon as reasonably practicable following shareholder approval.Tax Treatment of Awards to Employees Outside the United StatesThe grant and exercise of options and awards under the Plan to employees outside the United States may be taxed on a different basis.

 Executive Compensation Program Structure  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Overall Objectives• Compensation levels should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain talent;  
• Compensation should reflect leadership position and responsibility;  
• Executive compensation should be linked to the performance of the company as a whole; and  
• Compensation should motivate our executives to deliver our short and long-term business objectives and strategy.  
 Pay Mix Principles• Compensation should be tied to short-term performance and creation of long-term stockholder value and return;  
• Performance-based compensation should be a significant portion of total compensation for executives with higher levels of responsibility and a greater ability to influence enterprise results; and  
• Executives should own meaningful amounts of Pitney Bowes stock to align their interests with Pitney Bowes' stockholders.  
 Pay for Performance• Incentive compensation should reward both short-term and long-term performance;  
• A significant portion of our compensation should be variable based on performance; and  
• The annual and long-term incentive components should be linked to operational outcomes, financial results or stock price performance.

Each of these metrics excludes the impact of certain special items, both positive and negative, which could mask the underlying trend or performance within a business. The adjustments for special items are made consistently year-to-year and are explained on page 57 in "Non-GAAP Measures."We apply a Strategic Modifier of up to ten percentage points in determining final compensation payouts. The Strategic Modifier is based on the achievement of enterprise strategic goals. Strategic goals are targets that are important to the successful operation of the enterprise above and beyond financial goals. The strategic goals for 2018 were (i) Voice of the Client, measured as Net Promoter Score (NPS) and (ii) High Performance Culture, measured from an annual employee survey. These important strategic goals are the foundation for our future business success and essential for positive financial results.

The Committee considered the following six factors and determined there was no conflict in the engagement of Pay Governance and that Pay Governance is independent: (i) the provision of other services to the company by Pay Governance; (ii) the amount of fees received from the company by Pay Governance, as a percentage of the total revenue of Pay Governance; The Committee has the sole authority to hire and terminate its consultant.The Committee also reviews independence factors applicable to other consultants, including, outside law firms and Willis Towers Watson, management's compensation consultant.
performance assessment for the CEO and COO. The Committee reviews the financial accomplishments of the company, taking into account predetermined objectives for the preceding year, and determines actual base salary increases as well as the annual and long-term incentive compensation for the NEOs and recommends for approval by the independent board members the compensation for the CEO and COO. The actual payout levels for annual incentive compensation are based upon the company's performance against the predetermined financial objectives and other criteria, as discussed in further detail under "Annual Incentives" beginning on page 47. With respect to long-term incentive compensation, the Committee determines payout levels based on pre-determined financial objectives, and to the extent applicable, a relative TSR modifier, as discussed in further detail under "Long-term Incentives" beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement.To assist in this process, the Committee also reviews tally sheets prepared by the Human Resources department to evaluate the individual components and the total mix of current and historical compensation. These tally sheets aid the Committee in analyzing the individual compensation components as well as the compensation mix and weighting of the components within the total compensation package.To evaluate whether each NEO's compensation package is competitive with the marketplace, the Committee, and with respect to the CEO and COO, the independent board members, also review each executive's total direct compensation against market data during the benchmarking process as more fully described in "Assessing Competitive Practice" below. Based on the structure of considerations such as performance, the market median compensation of the respective positions, contributions to the company and experience that may lead to deviations from market relationships.
competitor due to the unique mix of our business, however, we use a peer group of companies similar in size and complexity to benchmark our executive compensation. Our peer group consists of companies with revenues between $2.0 billion and $9.8 billion, and market capitalization between $0.2 billion and $33.5 billion. Xerox and Fidelity National Information Services remain benefits, within the competitive market to attract and retain the talent and skills required to lead our business. This peer group consists of services, industrial, and technology companies. When evaluating the appropriateness of the peer group, the Committee considered factors such as revenue, net income, market capitalization, and complexity of the business to ensure a reasonable balance in terms of company size and an adequate number of peers. The Committee also considered any feedback received from stockholders.

Only shares owned outright, shares held in a trust and shares owned under a deferred compensation arrangement are counted toward the ownership requirement. Unvested shares and unexercised options do not count toward the ownership requirement.Beginning with RSU and PSU awards made in February 2015, executives who are required to own certain levels of company stock under the executive stock ownership policy may elect to defer the settlement of RSUs and PSUs upon vesting until the executives terminate employment or retire. Executives who choose to defer in this manner receive dividend equivalents once the awards vest, which are also deferred as vested RSUs.The Committee reviews executive stock ownership annually to make sure it is in line with the policy's objectives.
executives to remain with the company until the completion of the transaction to enable a successful transition. Payments of equity awards and Change of Control severance occur only when an employee is terminated without cause or when an employee voluntarily terminates for good reason (such as a reduction in position, pay or other constructive termination event) within two years following a Change of Control (a "double trigger" payment mechanism). The Change of Control, by itself, does not cause severance payments or accelerated vesting of equity awards. Our Change of Control arrangements fit into our overall compensation objectives because they are aligned with our goal of providing a compensation package sufficiently competitive to attract and retain talent and aligned with stockholder interests. With the double trigger payment mechanism applicable to both equity and cash awards and the lack of any gross-up, we believe the Change of Control arrangements are market leading from a corporate governance perspective. See discussion on Change of Control Arrangements on page 72.
We value PSU awards using a Monte-Carlo simulation, which is a generally accepted statistical technique for valuing PSUs. In determining the number of PSUs and RSUs to be awarded in the mix of long-term incentives for 2018, we value these awards based upon the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. In reporting the value in the Summary Compensation Table, we discount the value for non-payment of dividends during the vesting period as required by accounting guidance under ASC 718. For additional information on the accounting treatment for stock-based awards, see Note 20 to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Non-GAAP Measures  
 The company's financial results are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); however, in setting and measuring compensation targets, we use certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, adjusted earnings per share, revenue growth, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow.  
 Adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and adjusted earnings per share exclude the impact of special items like restructuring charges, tax adjustments, goodwill and asset write-downs, and costs related to dispositions and acquisitions. While these are actual company expenses, they can mask underlying trends associated with the business. Such items are often inconsistent in amount and frequency and as such, the adjustments provide greater insight into the current underlying operating trends of the business.  
 Revenue growth is presented on a constant currency basis to exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates since the prior period under comparison. This comparison provides better insight into the underlying revenue performance of the business and true operational performance from a comparable basis to prior period.  
 Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides insight into the amount of cash that management could have available for other discretionary uses. Free cash flow adjusts GAAP cash flow from operating activities for capital expenditures, restructuring payments, unusual tax settlements, special contributions to the company pension fund and cash used for other special items. Adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of reserve account deposits and finance receivables.  
 Non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an alternative to our reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. Further, our definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.
