PROXY STATEMENT 
DATED JANUARY 30, 2019 
FOR THE

To be held on February 25, 2019 
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board" or the "Trustees") of the Alight Series Trust (the "Trust") for use at a special meeting of shareholders of the Alight Money Market Fund (the "Fund"), the sole series of the Trust. Such meeting will be held at the principal executive offices of Alight Solutions, LLC, the administrator of the Trust ("Alight"), at 4 Overlook Point, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069, at 1:00 p.m. Central Time on February 25, 2019, or at such later time made necessary by any and all adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Meeting"). This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Special Meeting of Shareholders and the proxy card are first being mailed to shareholders of the Fund on or about February 1, 2019. 
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposal affecting the Fund and to consider and act upon any other business which may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments thereof: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To elect three (3) trustees to the Board of the Trust.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders of the Fund as of January 24, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to vote at the Meeting. All shareholders are entitled to vote on the proposal. Each whole share shall be entitled to one vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. Below is additional information about the proposal. 
PROPOSAL: 
TO ELECT THREE (3) TRUSTEES TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE TRUST 
Summary 
At the Meeting, shareholders of the Fund will be asked to elect the following three nominees to serve as Trustees on the Board of the Trust: John Oliverio, Jonathan Sohn and Jeremy Fritz. 
The Board currently consists of three Trustees: Mr. Oliverio, Mr. Fritz and Mr. Donald S. Hunt. Mr. Oliverio and Mr. Hunt were elected to the Board by a vote of the Trust's shareholders at the inception of the Trust. Mr. Fritz was appointed by the Board on August 22, 2016 to serve as a Trustee. 
Mr. Oliverio is not considered to be an "interested person" of the Trust (as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (an "Independent Trustee"). Mr. Fritz is considered an "interested person" of the Trust, as defined in the 1940 Act (an "Interested Trustee"), because of his affiliation with Alight Financial Solutions, LLC, the distributor of the Fund (the "Distributor"). Should Mr. Sohn be elected to the Board by the Fund's shareholders, it is expected that he would qualify as an Independent Trustee. At a meeting held on November 1, 2018, the Board of the Trust nominated each candidate for election to the Board. Mr. Sohn was recommended by a current Independent Trustee. 
Mr. Hunt is not standing for election to the Board. It is anticipated that, should the three nominees be elected to the Board, Mr. Hunt would resign from his position as a Trustee shortly thereafter the Meeting and that Mr. Sohn would fill the resulting vacancy. If shareholders of the Fund do not approve the proposal, the Board will consider other alternatives. 
Information About the Trustee Nominees 
The Board of Trustees has the overall responsibility for monitoring and supervising the operations of the Trust. The officers of the Trust are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the Trust. Each Trustee serves during the continued life of the Trust until he or she dies, resigns, is declared bankrupt or incompetent by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, or is removed, or, if sooner, until the next meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing Trustees and until the election and qualification of a successor. 
Independent Trustee Nominees 
The Independent Trustee nominees, their term of office and length of time served (or the length of time served should they be elected by shareholders, as applicable), their principal business occupations during the past five years, the number of portfolios overseen by the Trustee nominees (or the number of portfolios they will oversee should they be elected by shareholders, as applicable) and other directorships, if any, held by the Trustee nominees are shown below.

Trustee Experience and Qualifications 
The Board does not have a standing nominating committee tasked with considering trustee nominees. However, in lieu of such a committee, each Trustee is responsible for identifying and recommending individuals for Board membership and evaluating candidates for Board membership. The Board collectively reviews the background and the educational, business and professional experience of candidates, as well as their expected contributions to the Board. Because each Trustee participates in the consideration and evaluation of trustee candidates, and in consideration of the size of the Fund and the size of the Board, the Trustees have determined that its committee structure is appropriate. 
The Trustees may consider a number of factors in evaluating Board candidates, including a candidate's background, skills, experience and ability to carry out the responsibilities of the Board. The Board generally believes that diversity of backgrounds, skills and experience benefits the Board, but it has not adopted a formal policy in this regard. In evaluating candidates for Board membership, the Trustees will consider recommendations for trustees from shareholders. Nominations from shareholders should be in writing and sent to the Secretary of the Trust at the address listed in the chart above. 
Trustees nominated to serve on the Board are expected to possess relevant skills and experience, time availability and the ability to work well with the other Trustees. The Board has determined that each Trustee nominee is qualified to serve on the Board because of his specific attributes, including prior experience, background and skills. The following outlines each nominee's qualifications that led to the Board's conclusion that the nominee should serve as a Trustee on the Board. 
Independent Trustee Nominees 
John D. Oliverio. Mr. Oliverio, a certified public accountant, has more than 25 years of experience with Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, where he is Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Oliverio holds a degree in business administration from Loyola University in Chicago and a masters of management degree from Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management. He has served on the boards of directors of more than 25 health care organizations and associations. The Board concluded that Mr. Oliverio is suitable to act as a Trustee because of his academic background, professional experience, financial expertise and extensive board service. 
Jonathan Sohn. Mr. Sohn, a certified public accountant, has more than 10 years of experience as a Chief Financial Officer with healthcare provider networks. Previously, he was a senior manager of an accounting firm. Mr. Sohn holds a degree in accounting from Marquette University and a masters of business administration degree from Northwestern University. He has served on the financial and investment committees of several boards of directors of health care organizations. The Board concluded that Mr. Sohn is suitable to act as a Trustee because of his academic background, professional experience, financial expertise and board service. 
Interested Trustee Nominee 
Jeremy Fritz. Mr. Fritz is the Chief Operating Officer of the Distributor. Mr. Fritz graduated from the University of Toledo with a degree in Finance. He is a Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor and holds Series 4, 6, 7, 24, 53, 63, and 66 securities licenses from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He has 17 years of financial service industry experience, including supervisory responsibilities, customer service delivery, and managing all aspects of advisory and brokerage administration. The Board concluded that Mr. Fritz is suitable to act as a Trustee because of his academic background and business experience.

The Board is composed of three Trustees, two of whom are Independent Trustees. Mr. Fritz, the president of the Fund and the Chief Executive Officer of the Distributor, is considered an Interested Trustee because of his affiliation with the Distributor. The Board believes that having Independent Trustees constitute a majority of the Board allows it to exercise independent judgment, which enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that including an interested person on the Board provides it with the perspective of the Fund's affiliates, which is, in the view of the Board, a crucial element in the Trustees' decision-making process and aids them in serving the best interests of the Fund's shareholders. 
While there is no lead Independent Trustee, the two Independent Trustees comprise the standing Audit Committee, as described above, and meet regularly outside the presence of Fund management in executive session or with other service providers to the Fund. Each of the three Trustees was appointed to serve on the Board because of his experience, skills and qualifications. The Board holds regular quarterly meetings and may hold special meetings as necessary between scheduled meetings. The Board also conducts annual assessments of its effectiveness and the effectiveness of the Audit Committee. Based on the above, the Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given the size of the Board, the Fund and the nature of the Fund's business. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
As part of a "master-feeder" structure, the Fund invests all of its assets into the Treasury Money Market Master Portfolio (the "Portfolio"), a series of Master Investment Portfolio ("MIP"). Day-to-day risk management with respect to the investments of the Portfolio is the responsibility of BlackRock Fund Advisors ("BFA"), the Portfolio's adviser, which reports to the MIP's board and the Trust's Board on a regular and as-needed basis on the risks to which the Portfolio is subject. Alight, as the Fund's administrator, is responsible for the day-to-day risk management function for all other aspects of the Fund's operations. 
Risk oversight forms part of the Trustees' general oversight of the Fund. The Board is responsible for overseeing the operations of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, state law, other applicable laws, and the Fund's investment objectives and strategies. The Board reviews reports from management, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund, and its affiliates regarding risks faced by the Fund. 
The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"), who oversees the implementation and testing of the Fund's compliance program, reports directly to the Board regarding Fund compliance matters, and presents an annual report to the Board in accordance with the Fund's compliance policies and procedures. The CCO also provides to the Board updates on the application of the Fund's compliance policies and procedures and on how these procedures are designed to mitigate risk. The CCO also immediately reports to the Board as needed in case any problems associated with the Fund's compliance policies and procedures could expose (or might have the potential to expose) the Fund to risk. 
Shareholder Communications 
Shareholders may send communications to the Board by addressing the communications directly to the Board (or individual Trustees) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation that the communication is for the Board (or individual Trustees). Shareholders may send the communication to either the Trust's office or directly to such Board members at the address specified for each Trustee in the tables above. Alight will review and generally respond to other shareholder communications the Trust receives that are not directly addressed and sent to the Board. Such communications will be forwarded to the Board at Alight's discretion based on the matters contained therein. 
Required Vote 
Trustees are elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares present at the Meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote. This means that the three candidates who receive the largest number of votes will be elected as trustees. In the election of trustees, votes may be cast in favor of a candidate or withheld. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board of the Trust recommends that shareholders vote FOR each trustee nominee. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Trustees know of no other business to be presented at the Meeting other than the proposal described above, and they do not intend to bring any other matters before the Meeting. However, if any other matter should be properly presented, proxies will be voted by person named in the proxy in accordance with his best judgment in the interest of the Trust, the Fund and the shareholders. 
MEETING INFORMATION 
Voting 
Shareholders at the close of business on January 24, 2019 are entitled to vote at the meeting. Each whole share shall be entitled to one vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. All shares have non-cumulative voting rights. As of the Record Date, there were 612,899,230 outstanding shares of the Fund. 
If a shareholder wishes to participate in the Meeting, the shareholder may submit the proxy card sent with this Proxy Statement or attend in person. If your proxy card is properly returned, your shares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your instructions. Should shareholders require additional information regarding the proxy or need a replacement proxy card, they may contact the Trust at 847-295-5000. 
Revocation of Proxies 
Any proxy given by a shareholder is revocable until voted at the Meeting. Shareholders have the power to revoke a proxy by mail (addressed to the Secretary of the Trust, c/o Alight Solutions, LLC, 4 Overlook Point, Lincolnshire, Illinois 60069), or in person at the Meeting by executing a superseding proxy or by submitting a notice of revocation to the Trust. All properly executed proxies received in time for the Meeting will be voted as specified in the proxy. If your proxy has not been revoked, the shares represented by it will be cast at the Meeting. Attendance by a shareholder at the Meeting does not, in itself, revoke a proxy. 
Quorum 
Forty percent (40%) of the outstanding shares of the Fund present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to a vote at the Meeting shall constitute a quorum for the Fund at the Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the meeting, the person named as proxy may propose that the Meeting be adjourned to a later date to permit further solicitation of votes. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of shares voting on the adjournment. When voting on a proposed adjournment, the person named as proxy will vote all proxies that he is entitled to vote FOR approval of the proposal in favor of adjournment and for any votes withheld or voted against, the proxies will be voted against adjournment. 
Proxies that reflect abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter) will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be treated as votes cast on the proposal. Therefore, with respect to the proposal, which requires approval by a plurality of the votes cast, abstentions and broker non-votes would have no effect. 
SHAREHOLDER OWNERSHIP 
As of the Record Date, the following persons are known by the Trust to own, beneficially or of record, more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Fund:

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), located at Two Commerce Square, 2001 Market Street, Suite 1800, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, is the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust for its current fiscal year and for the Trust's most recently completed fiscal year. PwC is responsible for auditing the financial statements of the Fund annually and reviewing the tax returns of the Fund. PwC also audits the financial statements of the Portfolio. The selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust is approved annually by the Audit 
 Committee and ratified by the Board. PwC has confirmed that it is an independent registered public accounting firm and has advised the Trust that it does not have any direct or material indirect financial interest in the Fund. Representatives of PwC are not expected to be present at the Meeting. 
PwC billed the Trust aggregate fees for services rendered to the Trust for the last two fiscal years as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $         31,125        N/A     $ 31,125        N/A

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For the provision of non-audit services, the pre-approval requirement is waived pursuant to a de minimis exception if (i) such services were not recognized as non-audit services by the Trust at the time of  engagement, (ii) the aggregate amount of all such services provided is no more than 5% of the aggregate audit and non-audit fees paid by the Trust during the fiscal year in which the services are  provided; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Tax Fees were for review of the Trust's tax returns.  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, there were no services rendered by PwC in the past two fiscal years of the Trust for which the pre-approval requirement was waived. $5,500 and $5,500 are the aggregate fees for non-audit services that PwC billed for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, respectively, for services it rendered to the Trust. For the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, respectively, PwC billed $0 and $0 in aggregate fees for non-audit services rendered to Alight. The Audit Committee has considered whether PwC's provision of non-audit services to Alight that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee meets with PwC and management to review and pre-approve all audit services to be provided by the principal accountants. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all non-audit services to be provided by the principal accountants to (i) the Trust, and (ii) to any investment adviser, sub-adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser or sub-adviser, where the nature of the services relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Trust. 
Such pre-approval requirement is waived for non-audit services to be provided to the Trust if: (i) the aggregate amount of all non-audit services provided to the Trust is less than 5% of the total fees paid by the Trust to its independent auditors during the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are provided; (ii) the services were not recognized by management at the time of the engagement as non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by management and the Audit Committee approves them prior to the completion of the audit. Such pre-approval requirement also is waived for non-audit services to be provided to any investment adviser, sub-adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser or sub-adviser, where the nature of the services relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Trust if: (i) the aggregate amount of all non-audit services provided is less than 5% of the total fees paid by the Trust, 
 Alight and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Alight that provides ongoing services to the Trust to its independent auditors during the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are provided that would have to be pre-approved; (ii) the services were not recognized by management at the time of the engagement as non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by management and the Audit Committee approves them prior to the completion of the audit.

SHAREHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS—HOUSEHOLDING 
Householding is an option available to certain investors of the Fund. Householding is a method of delivery, based on the preference of the individual investor, in which a single copy of certain shareholder documents can be delivered to investors who share the same address, even if their accounts are registered under different names. Householding for the Fund may be available through certain broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries. If you are interested in enrolling in householding and receiving a single copy of shareholder documents, or alternatively if you currently are enrolled in householding and wish to change your householding status, please contact your financial intermediary. 
FUTURE MEETINGS; SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
The Trust generally is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and the Trust generally does not hold shareholder meetings in any year unless certain specified shareholder actions, such as election of trustees or approval of a new advisory agreement, are required to be taken under the 1940 Act or the Trust's charter documents, or at such other times as the Trustees may determine to be necessary, appropriate or advisable. Meetings of Shareholders that the Trustees have not called shall be called by the Secretary of the Trust upon the written request of the holders of Shares entitled to cast not less than 10% of all the votes then entitled to be cast on such matter at a meeting of Shareholders. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting subsequent to the Meeting should send written proposals to the Secretary of the Trust at the Trust's principal offices. The timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion in the proxy statement or presented at the meeting because certain rules under the Federal securities laws must be complied with before inclusion of the proposal is required. 
PLEASE COMPLETE, SIGN AND RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARD PROMPTLY.
