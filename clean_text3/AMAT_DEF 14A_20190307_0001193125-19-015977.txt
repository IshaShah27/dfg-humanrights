2019 NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY STATEMENT 
January 24, 2019 
Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
We invite you to attend Applied Materials' 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will be held on Thursday, March 7, 2019, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time at our corporate offices at 3050 Bowers Avenue, Building 1, Santa Clara, California 95054. 
This year's proxy statement reflects our continued focus on our strategy, an engaged and effective Board, sound corporate governance and executive compensation practices, and regular dialogue with and responsiveness to our shareholders. 
Financial Performance and Business Strategy 
Fiscal 2018 marked Applied Materials' third consecutive year of record financial performance. We delivered double-digit revenue growth across all of our segments, despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year. We are confident that longer-term growth drivers in both semiconductor and display remain firmly in place and will continue to create great opportunities for Applied Materials. 
As more industries become increasingly dependent on technology and data to define their futures, Applied's core wafer fabrication equipment market is poised to be structurally larger and less volatile than it was in the past. We have also expanded our product portfolio to better address major technology inflections. 
As we enter 2019, Applied is focused on expanding our role in the A.I.-Big Data era. Across the Company, we are taking a long-term perspective and will continue to prioritize our spending towards R&D to enable major technology inflections for our customers and drive growth and shareholder value. 
Shareholder Engagement 
We are committed to effective corporate governance that is informed by our shareholders, promotes the long-term interests of our shareholders, and strengthens Board and management accountability. 
We have a robust shareholder outreach program that focuses on governance, compensation, environmental and sustainability issues of interest to our shareholders. The outreach is a recurring, year-round effort, led by a cross-functional team that includes members of our Investor Relations, Global Rewards, Diversity and Inclusion, Environmental Health and Safety and Legal functions, with participation of the Chairman of the Board where appropriate. 
In response to shareholder feedback, in September 2018, we published our first Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Report, which highlights our D&I strategy, practices and goals, and provides key diversity data, including the gender and ethnic composition of our workforce. The publication of this report reflects the importance of this issue to Applied and the valuable input that we received from our shareholders. 
Thank you for your continued investment in and support of Applied Materials. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that strong corporate governance should include regular engagement with our shareholders to enable us to understand and respond to shareholder concerns. We have a robust shareholder outreach program led by a cross-functional team that includes members of our Investor Relations, Global Rewards, Diversity and Inclusion, Environmental Health and Safety and Legal functions. Independent members of our Board are also involved, as appropriate. In the fall, we solicit feedback on our executive compensation program, corporate governance and disclosure practices, and sustainability and corporate citizenship initiatives, as well as any matters voted on at our prior annual meeting. After the filing of our proxy statement, we engage again with our shareholders about important topics to be addressed at our annual meeting. Following our annual meeting, we review the results of the meeting and investor feedback, as well as evaluate emerging trends in corporate governance and other areas. We share feedback we receive from our shareholders with the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the full Board. Shareholder input is then factored into the Board's decision-making. See "Shareholder Engagement" on page 12 for more information.

2018 Performance Highlights 
In 2018, despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year, we delivered another year of outstanding results across several dimensions – company-wide, across our different products and segments, and from a financial and strategic perspective. Key highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Grew revenue to $17.3 billion in fiscal 2018, up 19% from the prior year, resulting in our third  consecutive year of record revenue;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Achieved record revenue across all of our segments;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Grew operating profit to a new record, resulting in record GAAP EPS of $3.23, and record non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $4.45  an increase of 2% and 37% over fiscal 2017, respectively (see the Appendix for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted measures);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Delivered operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, equal to 22% of revenue; and

2019 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
Strategic and Operational Highlights 
In fiscal 2018, we continued to drive profitable growth by executing our strategy. Key highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Increased our investments in research and development by more than $245 million over fiscal 2017,  to over $2.0 billion. We continue to prioritize our operating expenses towards R&D to solve major technology challenges for our customers and drive our long-term growth strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Delivered strong growth in key areas of our semiconductor equipment business in fiscal 2018  our  process equipment businesses and our metrology and inspection businesses delivered record revenues.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Made strong gains in the memory market and positioned the Company for further growth as customers  transition to new, higher performance devices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Built upon Applieds large installed base of manufacturing systems and grew the number of tools  under comprehensive service agreements three times faster than the installed base. We are now generating about half of our services revenue from long-term agreements. These agreements enable us to generate more value by helping our customers achieve  and maintain higher yields, and optimize factory output and operating costs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Continued to deliver key tools for Gen 10.5 display factories, allowing customers to manufacture  larger and more advanced TVs, and maintained the leading position in thin-film encapsulation, which enables next-generation OLED displays for mobile devices.  
[END TABLE]
In summary, each of our major business segments delivered double-digit growth in fiscal 2018 despite challenging market conditions. For the calendar year, we expect most of our semiconductor businesses gained or held share. However, other segments of the wafer fabrication equipment ("WFE") market where we do not compete, such as lithography, saw faster growth, and, as a result, we expect our overall WFE share declined in 2018. In addition, our stock price performance reflected weaker industry demand in the second half of the year, especially in the memory market. 
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee ("HRCC") set many performance targets for fiscal 2018 bonuses far above any records that Applied had achieved in the past in order to set a very high and challenging bar for the executive officers. During fiscal 2018, Applied achieved record EPS and other financial and operational objectives, but even so, our record financial results were below our aggressive targets. The HRCC also set aggressive goals for WFE share and total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to our peers, and these results were below the 1.0 targets. Accordingly, bonus payouts to our executive officers were below target bonus amounts.

Stock Price Performance 
While Applied achieved strong financial results in fiscal 2018, our stock price performance reflected weaker industry demand in the second half of the year, especially in the memory market. Over the past five years, Applied has outperformed the S&P 500 Index, as shown below.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
Pay and Performance 
We align compensation with our business objectives, performance and shareholder interests. The following chart shows the connection between TSR and the total direct compensation of our CEO for the last five fiscal years. While TSR has grown significantly over the previous four years, our CEO's total direct compensation has remained relatively flat during that period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Total direct compensation consists of annual base salary, annual incentive bonus and annual  long-term incentive award (grant date fair value of annual equity awards for all fiscal years, except for fiscal 2014, which consists of the total amount of cash-settled performance units). Total direct compensation shown above excludes other  amounts required by the SEC to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table.  
(2)   TSR line illustrates the total shareholder return on our common stock during the period from  October 24, 2014 through October 26, 2018 (the last business day of fiscal 2018), assuming $100 was invested on October 24, 2014 and assuming reinvestment of dividends.

BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
Board Composition and Nominee Considerations 
Nominee Skills and Experience 
Our director nominees have a wide variety of relevant skills, professional experience and backgrounds, and collectively bring to our Board diverse viewpoints and perspectives that strengthen its ability to represent the long-term interests of shareholders. The chart below illustrates broad categories of skills and expertise that our director nominees offer that we believe contribute to the effective leadership and exercise of oversight responsibilities by the Board. 
Semiconductor Industry and Technology Financial and ccounting Global Business Strategy and Innovation Operations and Infrastructure Government Policy M&A and Organizational Growth Risk Management Public Company Board Experience Executive Leadership 
Diversity. Because diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives foster thoughtful and robust discussion and decision-making, our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Governance Committee") and the Board place great value on a diversity of backgrounds, skills and viewpoints, gender and ethnicity among the directors when considering potential director candidates and nominees. Among the factors the Governance Committee considers in identifying and evaluating a potential director is the extent to which the candidate would add to the diversity of the Board. 
Independence. The Governance Committee also expects each non-employee director to be free of relationships, interests or affiliations that could give rise to conflicts of interest or interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment. Applied's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of our directors must be independent, and that our Audit, Human Resources and Compensation, and Governance Committees must consist solely of independent directors. 
Director independence is determined under Nasdaq listing standards and SEC rules. The Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Board who served during 
 2018 and all director nominees, other than Mr. Dickerson, our Chief Executive Officer, are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards and SEC rules. 
Tenure. The Board believes that new ideas and perspectives are critical to a forward-looking and strategic Board, as are the valuable experiences and deep understanding of Applied's business and industries that longer-serving directors offer. Our Governance Guidelines do not impose a tenure limit on Board service, and ongoing Board refreshment has resulted in a balanced range of tenures which ensures both continuity and fresh perspectives among our director nominees. 
Our directors are not typically nominated for re-election after they reach the age of 70. However, after due consideration, the Board has waived this policy with respect to Mr. Powell for 2019, as the Board continues to assess Board composition and the needs of the Board as part of its refreshment and succession planning process. The Board determined that it would be beneficial to have Mr. Powell continue to serve as director due to his financial and accounting expertise, his deep knowledge of the Company, and his leadership role as Chair of the Audit Committee. 
Applied Materials, Inc.    7 
Our nominees have an average tenure of 7 years, which is lower than the average tenure of other S&P 500 companies, and four of our nominees have been members of the Board for four years or less.

Board Composition and Refreshment 
Identification of New Director Candidates. Identifying and recommending individuals for nomination and election to our Board is a principal responsibility of our Governance Committee, which performs this function through an ongoing, year-round process. 
The Governance Committee regularly considers the size and composition of the Board and assesses whether the composition appropriately aligns with the Company's evolving business and strategic needs. The focus is on ensuring that the Board is composed of directors who possess a wide variety of relevant skills, professional experience and backgrounds, bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, and effectively represent the long-term interests of shareholders. 
In its consideration of potential director candidates, the Governance Committee reviews the short- and long-term strategies and interests of the Company to determine what current and future skills and experiences are required of the Board in exercising its oversight function. Specific search criteria evolve over time to reflect the Company's dynamic business and strategic needs and the changing composition of the Board, and may include such factors as: 
The Governance Committee also considers succession planning in light of anticipated retirements, and for Board and Committee Chair roles, to maintain relevant expertise and depth of experience. 
In addition, all director candidates are also expected to possess or demonstrate: 
The Governance Committee may retain a search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating new candidates for director nominees and may also consider referrals from directors, shareholders or other sources. The Governance Committee evaluates and interviews potential Board candidates and makes appointment recommendations to the full Board. All members of the Board may interview candidates. 
Recent Board Refreshment. As a result of the foregoing process, the Board has added four new directors over the last four years, each of whom have brought valuable and diverse backgrounds and perspectives to the overall composition of the Board. The most recent appointment was Mr. McGregor in January 2018. Mr. McGregor is a former CEO who brings to our Board deep experience in the global semiconductor industry, as well as experience in innovation, management development, and understanding global challenges and opportunities.

Based on the Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board selects director nominees and recommends them for election by Applied's shareholders. 
Shareholder Recommendations or Nominations. The evaluation procedures described above apply to all candidates for director nomination, including candidates submitted by shareholders. Shareholders wishing to recommend a candidate for consideration by the Governance Committee should submit the candidate's name, biographical data and a description of his or her qualifications in light of the criteria listed above to Christina Y. Lai, Corporate Secretary, Applied Materials, Inc., 3225 Oakmead Village Drive, M/S 1268, P.O. Box 58039, Santa Clara, CA 95052, or by e-mail at corporatesecretary@amat.com. 
Shareholders wishing to nominate a director should follow the specific procedures set forth in our Bylaws. 
Corporate Governance 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Applied's Corporate Governance Guidelines establish the governance framework within which the Board conducts its business and fulfills its responsibilities. These guidelines and other important governance materials are available on our website at: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/company/investor-relations/governance-documents. The Board regularly reviews our Corporate Governance Guidelines in light of legal and regulatory requirements, evolving best practices and other developments. 
Board Leadership 
Our corporate governance framework provides the Board flexibility to determine the appropriate leadership structure for the Company, and whether the roles of Chairman and CEO should be separated or combined. In making this determination, the Board considers many factors, including the needs of the business, the Board's assessment of its leadership needs from time to time and the best interests of shareholders. If the role of Chairman is filled by a director who does not qualify as an independent director, the Board will designate a Lead Independent Director. 
Applied Materials, Inc.    9 
The Board believes that it is currently appropriate to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO. The CEO is responsible for setting our strategic direction and the day-to-day leadership of our business, while the Chairman, along with the rest of our independent directors, ensures that the Board's time and attention are focused on effective oversight of the matters most critical to Applied. Mr. Iannotti, an independent director, currently serves as the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Iannotti has significant experience and knowledge of Applied, working with two CEOs and different management teams at Applied, and the Board believes that his deep knowledge of the Company and industry, as well as his strong leadership and governance experience, enable him to lead the Board effectively and independently. 
Director Onboarding and Education 
When new directors join the Board, they participate in a comprehensive onboarding program to learn about our industry, business, strategies and policies. The multi-day onboarding program includes meetings with senior executives to discuss our businesses, strategy, operations and our corporate functions such as finance, technology, information systems and legal, and a tour of the Maydan Technology Center, our state-of-the-art R&D facilities. New directors also meet with the executives and staff supporting the Committees on which they sit, as well as the Committees' external consultants and advisors. Each new director is also partnered with an experienced fellow director "mentor" to facilitate the integration of the new director to the Board. 
For continued education regarding our business and industry, we provide presentations by internal and external experts during Board meetings on topics such as technology inflections, industry trends and changes in the geopolitical and macroeconomic landscape, with particular focus on the implications and impact to the Company. Our Board and Committees also regularly review developments in corporate governance to continue enhancing the Board's effectiveness. We encourage directors to participate in external continuing director education programs and provide reimbursement for expenses associated with this participation. Throughout the year, Board members also attend Company events, including Analyst Day, our Engineering and Technology (ET) Conference, and Diversity Day, as well as meetings with leaders below the CEO Executive Staff level, which provides directors additional visibility into the Company's culture, strategies and operations. 
Board and Committee Evaluations 
Our Board recognizes that a thorough, constructive evaluation process enhances our Board's effectiveness and is an essential element of good corporate governance. Every year, the Governance Committee oversees the design and execution of the evaluation process, which involves assessments of the Board, each standing committee of the Board, and individual directors. Written questionnaires solicit feedback on a range of issues, including Board and Committee structure and composition; meeting process and dynamics; execution of key responsibilities; interaction with management; and information and resources. 
Following completion of the written questionnaires, the Chairman meets with each director individually to discuss additional input on these topics and to provide individual feedback. Committee chairs lead a discussion of evaluation results for their respective Committees, and a summary of Board and Committee evaluation results is discussed with the full Board, including suggestions for updating policies and practices per evaluation results. Director suggestions for improvements to evaluation questionnaires and process are considered for incorporation for the following year.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
One of the Board's most important functions is overseeing risk management for the Company. Applied's risk oversight framework illustrated below shows the close interaction between the full Board, individual committees and senior management. 
The Board The Board has the ultimate responsibility for, and is actively engaged in, oversight of the Companys risk management, in some cases directly by the full Board, and in some cases through delegation of certain types of risks to the oversight of the appropriate Board Committee. C O M M I T T E E S Audit Oversees the enterprise risk management program, as well as risks related to financial, regulatory, compliance, cybersecurity and environmental, health and safety matters, and regularly reviews with management, the head of internal audit and the independent accountants the steps taken to monitor and mitigate risk exposures Governance Oversees the management of risks related to corporate governance matters, including director independence, Board composition and succession, and overall Board effectiveness HR and Compensation Oversees risks associated with Applieds compensation policies, plans and practices, organizational talent and culture, management succession, and human capital management, including the corporate culture, and diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives Management Applieds management has day-to-day responsibility for: The BoardThe Board has the ultimate responsibility for, and is actively engaged in, oversight of the Companys risk management, in some cases directly by the full Board, and in some cases through delegation of certain types of risks to the oversight of the appropriate Board Committee.

Applied has implemented an enterprise risk management ("ERM") program, overseen by the Audit Committee, which provides an enterprise-wide perspective on Applied's risks. The risks identified are reported to the Board, with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial, and legal and compliance risks. Oversight responsibility for a particular risk may fall within an area of responsibility and expertise of one of the Board Committees. Management reviews the ERM program activities regularly with the Audit Committee and annually with the Board. 
Applied Materials, Inc.    11 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs. We have assessed our compensation policies, plans and practices, and determined that they do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Applied. To make this determination, our management reviewed our compensation policies, plans and practices, and assessed the following aspects: design, payment methodology, potential payment volatility, relationship to our financial results, length of performance period, risk-mitigating features, performance measures and goals, oversight and controls, and plan features and values compared to market practices. Management reviewed its analysis with the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, which agreed with this determination. Applied also has in place various controls to mitigate risks relating to compensation policies, plans and practices, such as executive stock ownership guidelines and a clawback policy that enables the recovery of certain incentive compensation payments in certain circumstances. 
Management Succession Planning 
The Board has delegated to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee ("HRCC") primary responsibility for overseeing management succession planning and executive organizational development, as well as human capital management programs. 
The HRCC reviews and advises on management's succession and development programs for the CEO and other senior executives, with an eye toward ensuring development of the talent needed to lead Applied today and in the future and readiness of succession candidates who can assume top management positions without undue interruption. Board members have opportunities throughout the year to engage with members of senior management and other high-potential leaders in a variety of formal and informal settings, including Board meetings and events, preparatory meetings, analyst meetings and internal and external business and technology conferences. 
The HRCC and Board also regularly discuss matters related to organizational health and discuss individual executive transitions as the need arises over the course of the year. The Board's goal is to have a long-term and continuing process for effective senior leadership development and succession and to ensure that there are ready choices available when the time is right. The HRCC also receives quarterly reports from the Group Vice President of Human Resources, covering a range of topics relating to corporate culture and human capital management, including the Company's diversity and inclusion practices and initiatives and its sexual harassment policies.  
Shareholder Rights 
In addition to direct engagement through our recurring shareholder engagement program discussed below, Applied has instituted a number of mechanisms that allow shareholders to advance their points of view, including: 
Right to Call a Special Meeting. Our Bylaws permit shareholders holding at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock to call a special meeting. 
Proxy Access. Our Bylaws permit proxy access. Any shareholder (or group of up to 20 shareholders) owning 3% or more of Applied's common stock continuously for at least three years may nominate up to two individuals or 20% of our Board, whichever is greater, as director candidates for election to the Board, and require us to include such nominees in our annual meeting proxy statement if the shareholders and nominees satisfy the requirements contained in our Bylaws. 
Majority Voting. Under our Bylaws, in any uncontested election of directors (an election in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), any nominee who receives a greater number of votes cast "for" his or her election than votes cast "against" his or her election will be elected. 
Our Bylaws provide that in the event an incumbent director receives more "against" than "for" votes, he or she shall tender his or her resignation after certification of the shareholder vote. Our Governance Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, will consider the offer of resignation, taking into consideration all factors it deems relevant, and recommend to the Board the action to be taken. The Board must take action on the recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. No director who tenders an offer of resignation may participate in the vote on the Governance Committee's recommendation or the Board's determination of whether to accept the resignation offer. Applied will publicly disclose the Board's decision, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting an offer to resign. 
Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that strong corporate governance should include regular engagement with our shareholders to enable us to understand and respond to shareholder concerns. 
Investor Relations. Our senior management team, including our CEO, CFO and members of our Investor Relations team, maintain regular contact with a broad base of investors, including through quarterly earnings calls, individual meetings and other channels for communication, to understand their concerns. In 2018, senior management participated in over 400 meetings with investors, including more than 160 meetings with the CFO and more than 20 with our CEO. 
Shareholder Outreach Program. In addition, we have a robust shareholder outreach program, which is a recurring, year-round effort, led by a cross-functional team that includes members of our Investor Relations, Global Rewards, Diversity and Inclusion, Environmental, Health & Safety and Legal functions, with participation of our Chairman of the Board where appropriate. The outreach enables us to build meaningful relationships and trust over time with our shareholders.

[END TABLE]
We engage with a significant cross-section of our shareholder base, including large institutional investors, pension funds, and other investors. Topics of discussion include key business, Board, governance, executive compensation, environmental, sustainability and diversity and inclusion matters, as well as other subjects of interest to our shareholders. Based on feedback from shareholders, we have over the last few years adopted proxy access and a special meeting right and implemented changes to our executive compensation programs. During the fall of 2018, we contacted the holders of approximately 45% of our outstanding shares, and engaged in active discussions on these topics with investors who requested meetings, representing approximately 29% of our shares outstanding. 
Board Responsiveness. In 2018, as part of our regular shareholder engagement program and at the request of our Governance Committee, we conducted extensive shareholder outreach efforts to solicit feedback regarding two topics – the right to act by written consent and disclosure of EEO-1 diversity data. These topics were the subject of shareholder proposals that had both received significant, although not majority, shareholder support at our 2018 Annual Meeting.  
Action by Written Consent. Consistent with the lower-than-majority level of support for the written consent proposal at the 2018 Annual Meeting, investors who engaged with us did not express strong pressure on the Company to implement action by written consent. Shareholders expressed various views regarding action by written consent. While some shareholders indicated general support for action by written consent as a matter of principle in favor of greater shareholder rights, most shareholders with whom we engaged expressed disinterest or active opposition to adoption of the right based on several factors: 
Applied Materials, Inc.    13 
Based on the input provided by shareholders, reflecting the lack of a clear consensus to adopt action by written consent, concerns about potential disruption and disenfranchisement that could result from exercise of the right, and the meaningful shareholder rights that Applied already has in place, including proxy access and a special meeting right implemented following extensive shareholder outreach, the Governance Committee determined that providing for a right to act by written consent is not warranted. 
Disclosure of Diversity Data. In September 2018, we published our first Diversity and Inclusion ("D&I") Report, which highlights our D&I strategy, practices and goals, and provides key diversity data, including the gender and ethnic composition of our workforce. The publication of this report not only reflects the importance of this issue to Applied, but also the input that we received from our shareholders. Shareholder feedback to the report was universally positive, with the view that the report demonstrated our commitment to diversity and inclusion, transparency in disclosing data and accountability in working towards our goals. Shareholders also expressed appreciation of our continuing efforts to explore the disclosure of additional data regarding the diversity of our workforce. Based on our 2017 workforce demographics, we set new goals for increasing our global diversity and ensuring we have an inclusive work environment, which include increasing women and underrepresented minorities in our workforce.

Applied's Chief Executive Officer should own Applied stock with a value of at least six times his annual base salary. Each Section 16 officer on the CEO Executive Staff should own Applied stock with a value of at least three times his or her annual base salary. As of December 31, 2018, all of our directors and executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.

Each non-employee director receives an annual cash retainer for his or her service on the Board, as well as additional cash retainers if he or she serves as the Chairman of the Board, on a committee or as the chair of a committee. Annual retainers are paid quarterly and are prorated based on the director's service during the fiscal year. The following table sets forth cash compensation for non-employee directors in effect during fiscal 2018.

In addition, non-employee directors receive $2,000 per meeting for service on the Investment Committee or other ad-hoc committee of which they are a member, or $3,000 per meeting if they are the chair of such a committee. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for travel and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to attendance at Board and committee meetings, business events on behalf of Applied, and seminars and programs on subjects related to their Board responsibilities.
Equity Compensation 
Initial Grant. Upon initial appointment or election to the Board, a non-employee director receives a grant of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Applied common stock with a fair market value on the date of grant equal to $225,000 (rounded down to the nearest whole share), pro-rated based on the period starting on the day of initial appointment or election and ending on the day of the next scheduled annual meeting of shareholders. 
Annual Grant. Each non-employee director elected at an annual meeting receives on that date a non-discretionary grant of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Applied common stock with a fair market value on the date of grant equal to $225,000 (rounded down to the nearest whole share). A non-employee director who is initially appointed or elected to the Board on the day of an annual meeting of shareholders receives only an annual grant. Each of our non-employee directors re-elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting received a grant of 3,789 restricted stock units on that date. 
Vesting. Grants made to our non-employee directors vest in full on the earlier of March 1 of the year following the date of grant or the next annual meeting, provided the non-employee director remains on the Board through the scheduled vesting date. Vesting of these grants will be accelerated in full upon a non-employee director's earlier termination of service on the Board due to disability or death, or upon a change of control of Applied if the director ceases to be a non-employee director (and does not become a member of the board of directors of any successor corporation or its parent). Non-employee directors may elect in advance to defer receipt of vested shares until their termination of service on the Board. 
Limit on Awards. Under our amended and restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan, grants of equity awards to any individual non-employee director may not exceed a fair market value totaling more than $400,000 in any fiscal year. 
Charitable Matching Contributions 
Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in The Applied Materials Foundation Matching Gift Program, under which the Foundation annually will match up to $3,000 of a non-employee director's donations to eligible non-profit and educational organizations, as well as match an unlimited amount of donations to our annual North America Food Drive.

PROPOSAL 2—APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), we are asking shareholders to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs, as described in this Proxy Statement. We seek this approval each year. Our annual "say-on-pay" proposals have been supported by our shareholders each year since we began providing this vote in 2011, and received the support of 96% of votes cast in 2018. 
Our Board of Directors believes that our compensation policies and practices promote a performance-based culture and align our executives' interests with those of our shareholders through a strong emphasis on at-risk compensation tied to the achievement of performance objectives and shareholder value. Our executive compensation program is also designed to attract and retain highly-talented executives who are critical to the successful implementation of Applied's strategic plan. 
Pay and Performance. We align compensation with our business objectives, performance and shareholder interests. See pages 26 and 35 for charts illustrating the connection between key financial and Company performance metrics and the compensation paid to our CEO during the last five fiscal years. 
Significant Portion of CEO Pay Consists of Variable Compensation and Long-Term Incentives. In fiscal 2018, 93% of our CEO's compensation comprised variable compensation elements, and 83% of his overall compensation was delivered in equity with multi-year vesting. Performance objectives include financial and market objectives relating to adjusted operating margin, gross margin, WFE market share and relative TSR, as well as strategic and operational objectives, as described on page 32. 
Please see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section for further discussion of our executive compensation program and the fiscal 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
We are asking our shareholders to approve the compensation of our NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement by voting in favor of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the Summary Compensation Table, other compensation tables, narrative discussion and related disclosure." 
Even though this say-on-pay vote is advisory and therefore will not be binding on the Company, the HRCC and the Board value the opinions of our shareholders, and will consider the results of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs.

Through our broad portfolio of products and technologies, innovation leadership and focused investments in research and development, we are enabling our customers' success, thereby generating record performance for the Company and creating significant value for our shareholders. 
Our Performance Highlights 
In 2018, despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year, we delivered another year of outstanding results across several dimensions – company-wide, across our different products and segments, and from a financial and strategic perspective. Key highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Grew revenue to $17.3 billion in fiscal 2018, up 19% from the prior year, resulting in our third  consecutive year of record revenue;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Achieved record revenue across all of our segments;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Grew operating profit to a new record, resulting in record GAAP EPS of $3.23, and record non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $4.45  an increase of 2% and 37% over fiscal 2017, respectively (see the Appendix for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted measures);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Applied Materials, Inc.    21 
Key financial highlights for our reporting segments in fiscal 2018 include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Semiconductor Systems segment: we delivered record annual revenue of $10.9 billion, up 15%  from the prior year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Applied Global Services segment: we grew revenue to a record $3.8 billion, up 24% from  fiscal 2017. We accelerated our momentum by introducing new ways to help our customers manage increasing complexity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Display and Adjacent Markets segment: we delivered manufacturing equipment for increasingly  larger and more advanced TVs, as well as high-resolution mobile displays, growing revenue to a record $2.5 billion, up 31% from fiscal 2017.  
[END TABLE]
Strategic and Operational Highlights 
Applied's strategy is to deliver highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that enable major technology inflections and drive our customers' success. 
See inflections Identify customers Develop Differentiated Valuable Ensure customer success early High Value Problems Sustainable products + Generate residual value   
In fiscal 2018, we continued to drive profitable growth by executing our strategy. Key highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Increased our investments in research and development by more than $245 million over fiscal 2017,  to over $2.0 billion. We continue to prioritize our operating expenses towards R&D to solve major technology challenges for our customers and drive our long-term growth strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Delivered strong growth in key areas of our semiconductor equipment business in fiscal 2018  our  process equipment businesses and our metrology and inspection businesses delivered record revenues.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Made strong gains in the memory market and positioned the Company for further growth as customers  transition to new, higher performance devices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Built upon Applieds large installed base of manufacturing systems and grew the number of tools  under comprehensive service agreements three times faster than the installed base. We are now generating about half of our services revenue from long-term agreements. These agreements enable us to generate more value by helping our customers achieve  and maintain higher yields, and optimize factory output and operating costs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Continued to deliver key tools for Gen 10.5 display factories, allowing customers to manufacture  larger and more advanced TVs, and maintained the leading position in thin-film encapsulation, which enables next-generation OLED displays for mobile devices.  
[END TABLE]
In summary, each of our major business segments delivered double-digit growth in fiscal 2018 despite challenging market conditions. For the calendar year, we expect most of our semiconductor businesses gained or held share. However, other segments of the wafer fabrication equipment ("WFE") market where we do not compete, such as lithography, saw faster growth, and, as a result, we expect our overall WFE share declined in 2018. In addition, our stock price performance reflected weaker industry demand in the second half of the year, especially in the memory market. 
The HRCC set many performance targets for fiscal 2018 bonuses far above any records that Applied had achieved in the past in order to set a very high and challenging bar for the executive officers. During fiscal 2018, Applied achieved record EPS and other financial and operational objectives, but even so, our record financial results were below our aggressive targets. The HRCC also set aggressive goals for WFE share and total shareholder return ("TSR") performance relative to our peers, and these results were below the 1.0 targets. Accordingly, bonus payouts to our executive officers were below target bonus amounts.

Other Key Compensation Practices 
We are committed to executive compensation practices that drive performance, mitigate risk and align the interests of our leadership team with the interests of our shareholders. Below is a summary of best practices that we have implemented and practices that we avoid because we believe they are not in the best interests of Applied or our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓   Pay for Performance  Significant majority of NEO target compensation is performance-based and tied to pre-established performance goals aligned with our  short- and long-term objectives.      Ò   No Guaranteed Bonuses  Our annual bonus plans are performance-based and do not include any minimum payment levels. 
 ✓   Mitigation of Risk  Use of varied performance measures in incentive programs mitigates risk that executives will be motivated to pursue results with respect to any one performance measure to the  detriment of Applied as a whole.      Ò   No Hedging or Pledging  Our insider trading policy prohibits all directors, NEOs and other employees from engaging in hedging or other speculative trading, and prohibits directors and NEOs from  pledging their shares. 
 ✓   Compensation Recoupment Policy  Both our annual cash bonus plan and our stock incentive plan contain clawback provisions providing for reimbursement of incentive compensation from NEOs  in certain circumstances.      Ò   No Perquisites  We do not provide material perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs or directors, except in connection with business-related relocation. 
 ✓   Stock Ownership Guidelines  All senior officers and directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines to align their interests with shareholders interests.      Ò   No Dividends on Unvested Equity Awards  We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested equity awards. 
 ✓   Double-Trigger Change-in-Control Provisions  Equity awards for all NEOs require a double-trigger of both  a change-in-control and termination of employment for vesting acceleration benefits to apply.      Ò   No Executive Pensions  We do not offer any executive pension plans. 
 ✓   Annual Say-On-Pay Vote  We seek annual shareholder feedback on our  executive compensation program.       Ò    No Tax Gross-Ups  We do not pay tax gross-ups, except in connection with  business-related relocation or expatriate assignments.

Compensation Governance and Decision-Making Framework 
Overview of Compensation Program Philosophy and Governance Framework 
Our executive compensation program has three principal objectives: 
We seek to achieve these objectives by: 
The HRCC uses these principles to determine base salaries, annual incentive bonuses and long-term incentive awards. The HRCC also considers Applied's business objectives, external factors such as geopolitical and economic environment, competitive practices and trends, and corporate considerations, including the affordability of the compensation program. 
The HRCC further considers the results of the annual advisory "say-on-pay" vote and shareholder feedback. At our Annual Meeting in 2018, our "say-on-pay" proposal received a substantial majority (96%) of votes cast. In consideration of this vote and feedback from our shareholders through our extensive outreach effort, the HRCC approved an executive compensation program for fiscal 2018 that is unchanged from the fiscal 2017 program. 
Fiscal 2018 Peer Group Companies 
The HRCC regularly reviews compensation paid by our peer group, which consists of a broad range of high-technology companies whose businesses are similar to ours and with which we typically compete for executive talent, as a reference point for evaluating our compensation program. 
For the composition of the fiscal 2018 peer group, we considered companies that met the following criteria: (1) technology companies with manufacturing operations, (2) companies whose revenues were approximately one-third to five times that of Applied, (3) companies with global operations that disclose executive compensation pursuant to SEC rules, (4) companies that compete with us for key talent, and (5) companies that devote significant resources to research and development as a percentage of revenue. Based on this assessment, the HRCC determined to remove EMC Corp. and SanDisk Corp., which were part of the 2017 peer group, from the fiscal 2018 peer group due to their acquisition by other companies, one of which is in our peer group. Each of the other companies in the peer group listed below met most, if not all, of the five screening criteria listed above and continued to be included in the peer group; in addition, several of the companies were among our principal U.S. competitors or top U.S. customers. 
Data gathered on the peer group include base salary, bonus, targeted cash compensation, long-term incentive awards and total direct compensation. The HRCC uses this information as a reference point rather than to target a specific percentile for our NEOs. The peer group data is gathered from the sources described in "Role of Compensation Consultant" below.

Components of Total Direct Compensation 
Determining Annual Total Direct Compensation 
At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the HRCC evaluated each NEO's annual total direct compensation – consisting of annual base salary, annual incentive bonus and annual long-term incentive award. As part of this annual evaluation, the HRCC considers the NEO's scope of responsibility, performance, skill set, prior experience and achievements, advancement potential, impact on results and expected future contributions to our business. The HRCC also considers the compensation levels of an executive officer relative to other Applied officers, the need to attract and retain talent, business conditions, and compensation levels at our peer companies for comparable positions; however, no individual element of compensation is targeted to a peer percentile range. The HRCC uses peer group data as a tool to assess how our executives' compensation compares to the market rather than as a means to establish specific target compensation levels. Actual pay results vary based on the overall performance of the Company and individual NEO performance, as the largest portion of NEO compensation is performance-based. 
Base Salaries 
Base salaries and bonus opportunities are designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain executive talent, as well as to align pay with performance. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the HRCC determines each NEO's targeted total cash compensation (salary and target bonus). 
Base salaries are an annual fixed level of cash compensation. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, the HRCC increased each of Dr. Raja's and Mr. Ghanayem's base salary from $500,000 to $550,000 to reflect his additional responsibilities and promotion from Group Vice President to Senior Vice President. These promotions were made in connection with a new organizational structure implemented in November 2017 designed to accelerate our strategy and growth. The HRCC did not change base salaries for the other NEOs in fiscal 2018. The HRCC determined that continuing base salary amounts from fiscal 2017 for those other NEOs was sufficiently competitive to provide adequate retention value and allowed Applied to continue its focus on weighting cash compensation toward performance-based incentives. 
Annual Incentive Bonus Opportunities 
Bonus Plan Overview. In fiscal 2018, all of our NEOs participated in the Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). The Bonus Plan is a shareholder-approved bonus program designed to motivate and reward achievement of Applied's business goals and to attract and retain highly-talented individuals. The annual incentive bonus opportunity for each NEO under the Bonus Plan is directly linked to Applied's achievement of financial and market performance, operational performance and strategic objectives, in addition to individual performance. Company and individual goals are designed to incentivize management to drive strong operating performance, invest in innovation to drive future growth and create shareholder value. Our Bonus Plan is performance-based and does not include any minimum payment levels. 
Determining Target Bonus Amounts. Target bonus amounts for the NEOs are expressed as a percentage of base salary. The HRCC sets the annual target bonus amount for each NEO, taking into consideration Mr. Dickerson's recommendations regarding the annual target bonus amounts for each of the NEOs other than himself. In early fiscal 2018, Mr. Dickerson recommended that, for each NEO other than Dr. Raja and Mr. Ghanayem, the target bonus amounts remain unchanged from fiscal 2017. Mr. Dickerson recommended, and the HRCC approved, increasing each of Dr. Raja's and Mr. Ghanayem's target bonus from 120% to 135% of his salary in connection with each officer's promotion. In making his recommendations, Mr. Dickerson 
Applied Materials, Inc.    29 
 relied on a variety of factors, including publicly-available data and market survey data, as described above, as well as his assessment of overall economic and business conditions. 
 The HRCC considered these same factors in deciding not to increase Mr. Dickerson's target bonus. 
Assessing Performance and Payout. The determination of fiscal 2018 performance and annual incentive bonuses for our NEOs consisted of three key steps, as illustrated in the diagram below and the following discussion. 
Initial Performance NEO Bonus Determination Initial Performance Hurdle Corporate Scorecard Individual Performance Factor Threshold performance requirement that must be achieved for maximum bonuses to become available Assessment of performance against pre-defined financial, operational and strategic corporate goals Assessment of individual NEO performance against personal objectives and contributions to the businessInitial performance goal for fiscal 2018 was non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $3.50 For fiscal 2018, 50% based on financial and market performance; 50% based on objective and measurable operational and strategic goals   
The HRCC believes that this multi-step performance framework appropriately emphasizes financial performance, while also providing a mechanism to assess achievement of key business imperatives by individual NEOs. 
Initial Performance Goal. For fiscal 2018, the HRCC chose non-GAAP adjusted EPS as the initial performance hurdle. EPS, an indicator of overall Company financial performance, is a measure of profits generated on a per share basis that are available either to reinvest in the business or distribute to shareholders, and has a strong link to share price valuation. 
If Applied does not achieve a threshold non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $3.50 for the fiscal year, no bonus is payable. If this threshold is achieved, the maximum bonus that becomes payable for each NEO is the lowest of: (a) $5 million, (b) 3x a corporate bonus pool funding modifier, multiplied by the target bonus, and (c) 3x the target bonus, as a percentage of base salary. 
In fiscal 2018, Applied's non-GAAP adjusted EPS was $4.45, resulting in achievement of the initial performance goal under the Bonus Plan. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure that excludes certain items from EPS determined in accordance with GAAP (see Appendix for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EPS). 
Non-GAAP adjusted EPS does not exclude share-based compensation expenses. 
Balanced Corporate Scorecard. If the initial performance goal is achieved, the HRCC then uses the corporate scorecard to evaluate achievement of pre-defined corporate objectives and goals for each NEO and as a primary mechanism to exercise negative discretion from the maximum bonus amount. The scorecard is designed to measure financial and non-financial objectives that are considered by the HRCC to be key drivers of the Company's near-term financial and operational success that will create shareholder value over the longer-term. As in previous years, the fiscal 2018 scorecard measured corporate performance in five broad categories: (1) Financial and Market Performance, (2) Products and Growth, (3) Execution, (4) Customers, Field and Service and (5) People and Organization. These categories align with and support the Company's strategy of strengthening our materials engineering capabilities to enable major technology inflections for our customers and positioning Applied for sustainable growth to support long-term value creation for its shareholders.

NEO Objectives and Weightings. Each NEO was assigned individualized weightings for all measures to reflect the relative impact and contributions of that NEO and his business or organizational unit to Applied's overall performance with respect to a particular measure. The Financial and Market Performance measures were weighted at approximately 50% for all NEOs. The corporate scorecard objectives and weightings were the same for Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Durn. All other NEOs had objectives and weightings as set forth in the table below. 
Goal Setting and Measurement. At the beginning of the fiscal year, the HRCC reviewed objectives, goals and weightings initially proposed by management, provided input and made adjustments, and approved the final corporate scorecard and individual weightings for each NEO. Scorecard objectives are intended to be very challenging to incentivize our NEOs to achieve performance levels that are higher than our externally communicated financial targets. Consequently, delivering results below the 100% target level can still represent meaningful progress towards our long-term strategic goals. Progress towards achieving the corporate scorecard objectives was evaluated and tracked quarterly during the fiscal year. Scores were awarded for each metric under the scorecard based on the degree to which the pre-determined goals for that metric were achieved. Performance hurdles were set to measure achievement at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 levels, with a score of 1.0 indicating performance that met very high expectations and scores over 1.0 indicating extraordinary achievement. At the end of the fiscal year, scores were calculated based on actual performance against objectives and were presented to the HRCC to review, adjust and approve.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Individual Performance Factor. The HRCC also considered the individual performance of each NEO as indicated by that NEO's individual performance factor ("IPF"). The IPF applied only if the initial performance goal and at least some of the corporate scorecard objectives were achieved. The IPF modified the initial bonus amount as determined based on achievement against the corporate scorecard objectives. The IPF modifier ranges from 0 to 1.5. 
The HRCC determined the IPFs for all NEOs. Mr. Dickerson's IPF was based on the HRCC's year-end assessment of his leadership and the Company's overall performance during the year. The HRCC determined the IPF for each other NEO taking into consideration Mr. Dickerson's recommendation, which included his assessment of the achievement of strategic, financial, operational and organizational performance goals specific to the business or organizational unit for which the NEO was responsible, as well as the NEO's leadership skills and current and expected contributions to the business. For fiscal 2018, in light of the significant efforts by each NEO in leading his respective organization, and in Mr. Dickerson's case, Applied, and in recognition of the significant teamwork required of the leadership team to deliver outstanding financial results despite challenging market conditions, the HRCC assigned each NEO an IPF of 1.1.

Actual Bonus Payouts. The diagram below shows the results for each of the three key steps in determining the NEOs' fiscal 2018 annual incentive bonuses. Despite achieving record EPS and many of our fiscal 2018 corporate scorecard objectives, in addition to each NEO achieving a strong IPF against his personal objectives and contributions to the business, there were certain important scorecard areas where we did not reach the targets set at the beginning of the year, which together reduced bonus payouts for our NEOs by, on average, 31% from target bonus amounts.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Pay Driven by Operating Performance. Our process for determining annual bonus awards has resulted in strong pay and performance alignment. Despite achieving record EPS and many of the fiscal 2018 corporate scorecard objectives, in addition to achieving a strong IPF against his personal objectives and contributions to the Company, there were certain important scorecard areas where we did not reach the aggressive targets set at the beginning of the year, which together reduced bonus payout for our CEO from fiscal 2017. The chart below shows the actual annual bonus awards for our CEO and our non-GAAP adjusted EPS achievements over the last five fiscal years. 
CEO Actual Annual Bonus vs. Earnings Per Share 
Non-GAAP adjusted EPS is a performance target under our bonus plan. See Appendix for non-GAAP reconciliations. 
Long-Term Incentives 
Overview. Applied's long-term incentive compensation program is intended to help (1) achieve our business objectives, (2) attract, motivate and retain key talent, and (3) align our executives' interests with shareholders' interests to maximize long-term shareholder value. 
Timing of Awards. The HRCC grants equity and other long-term incentive awards to NEOs under our shareholder-approved Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"). The HRCC has not granted, nor does it intend to grant, equity awards in anticipation of the release of material, nonpublic information that is likely to result in changes to the price of our common stock, such as a significant positive or negative earnings announcement. Similarly, Applied has not timed, nor does it intend to time, the release of material, nonpublic information based on equity award grant dates. 
Fiscal 2018 Equity Awards 
The HRCC believes that a meaningful portion of NEOs' target compensation should be in the form of long-term incentives. 
 These awards are intended to reward performance over a multi-year period, align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, instill an ownership culture, enhance the personal stake of executive officers in the growth and success of the Company, and provide an incentive for continued service at the Company. 
Given the comprehensive review of Applied's compensation program in fiscal 2017 performed by the HRCC and the strong support received from our shareholders on our incentive programs last year, we continued our approach to make performance-based equity awards a substantial portion of the overall value of equity awards granted to our NEOs. The long-term incentive program, which is designed to align performance metrics with our strategic goals over a three-year performance period, has remained unchanged for fiscal 2018. 
The long-term incentive awards for NEOs consist of two forms of equity vehicles: performance share units ("PSUs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The target vehicle mix of the awards consists of 75% PSUs and 25% RSUs for the CEO and 50% PSUs and 50% RSUs for the other NEOs. 
Applied Materials, Inc.    35 
For fiscal 2018, in December 2017, the HRCC granted the number of PSUs and RSUs listed in the below table to our NEOs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

  (1)  Value of awards is based on Applied's stock price on the grant date. Amounts shown in the  "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table represent grant date fair value determined pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 718.  
  (2)   Number of shares calculated by dividing value of awards by $51.31, the closing price of Applied  stock on December 14, 2017, the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
Size of Performance-Based Equity Awards. In determining the size of the awards, the HRCC considered each NEO's award as a component of his total direct compensation. Target fiscal 2018 long-term equity awards were determined in light of each NEO's scope of responsibility, performance, impact on results and expected future contributions to our business, compensation levels relative to other Applied officers, the wholesale changes made to the long-term incentive program in fiscal 2017 and establishment of three-year performance goals, the need to attract and retain talent, and business conditions. In addition, the fiscal 2018 target grant sizes provided sufficient performance-based equity incentives to align compensation with the long-term interests of our shareholders, were in line with market norms for the NEOs' respective roles and were sufficient to provide incentive for them. 
Performance Share Units. The fiscal 2018 PSUs, granted in December 2017, will vest three years from the grant date based on achievement of average non-GAAP adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 and average WFE market share goals for calendar years 2017 through 2019, with equal weighting given to each metric. 
FY18 Long-Term Incentive Plan Metrics 50% WFE Market Share - 3-year Average Relativemeasure versus our industry peer group that reflects the strategic importance and adoption of our products in the marketplace, our brand interactions across our segments, and our ability to grow our business oer time and across business cycles. 50% Non-GAAP adjusted Operating Profit Margin-3-year Average Reflects an important measure of profitability, value creation, and the ability of management to improve operational efficiency over time. It is also a key metric for our shareholders. 
The number of PSUs that may vest is based on the achievement of threshold (minimum required for a payout), target or maximum levels of each metric and may range from 50% to 200% of the target number of shares, as set forth below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Threshold      50%   
 Target      100%   
 Maximum      200%   
[END TABLE]
If the threshold level is not achieved, then no shares will vest. If achievement falls between threshold, target or maximum levels, the portion of the award that may vest will be determined based on straight-line interpolation. 
In setting goals for the PSUs, the HRCC considered Applied's historical results and relative performance, and established goals that are aligned with Applied's financial and strategic objectives and will require significant effort to achieve the maximum level. 
Restricted Stock Units. The RSU awards are scheduled to vest ratably over three years, providing a link to shareholder value creation and maintaining retention value. 
36    2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Changes for Fiscal 2019. In 2018, the HRCC approved certain changes to the long-term incentive program. For fiscal 2019, the PSU awards will continue to be subject to the achievement of two performance metrics over a three-year performance period: (1) three-year average non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and (2) three-year average relative TSR, rather than WFE market share as has been used for PSUs granted in previous years. 
FY19 Long-Term Incentive Plan Metrics 50% Relative TSR-3-year Average Captures the full scale of our business and greater incentivizes management to outperform the market through each business environment. 50% Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Profit Margin-3-year Average Reflects and important measure of profitability, value creation, and the ability of management to improve operational efficiency over time. It is also a key metric for our shareholders. 
WFE market share relative to our key industry peers remains a strong measure of our operating performance, but given the evolution of Applied's business to encompass diversified revenue streams beyond semiconductors, including the Display and services businesses as long-term drivers of growth, the HRCC approved a shift toward relative TSR to ensure that the go-forward metric captures the full scale of our business and greater incentivizes management to outperform the market through each business environment. 
Relative TSR will be measured over a three-year period relative to the S&P 500 Index. A TSR payout factor will be determined by calculating the Company's TSR percentile rank within the S&P 500 based on the approved payout scale detailed below. The TSR calculation uses a 60-day average stock price at the beginning and end of the performance period for measurement purposes. This approach minimizes the impact of a single beginning and ending point stock price for each performance cycle. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Above 25th Percentile      50%

 75th Percentile      200%   
[END TABLE]
The HRCC also approved retirement provisions applicable to long-term incentive awards, beginning with fiscal 2019 awards. The provisions, which will become effective in January 2020, provide for a partial payout of PSU awards based on actual performance at the conclusion of the three-year performance period and partial accelerated vesting of RSU awards in the event of a qualifying retirement based on age and years of service. The provisions establish a consistent retirement policy and are designed to maintain engagement and focus, as well as provide retention incentive, for our executive officers as some approach potential retirement decisions. 
Promotion Awards. In November 2017, in connection with the promotions of Dr. Raja and Mr. Ghanayem, the HRCC granted each of them 35,506 RSUs with a value of $2,000,000. The RSU awards are scheduled to vest ratably over three years, subject to each officer's continued employment through each applicable vesting date. 
CFO Equity Award. In October 2018, the HRCC approved a one-time equity retention award for Mr. Durn. In light of Mr. Durn's strong performance and smooth transition from the previous CFO, the value of equity awards from his former employer that he forfeited, and the value of outstanding Applied equity awards held by him, the HRCC granted Mr. Durn a retention award. Mr. Durn's award consists of 72,908 RSUs with a value of $2,500,000, which are scheduled to vest ratably over three years, subject to his continued employment through each applicable vesting date. 
Role and Authority of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee 
The HRCC has a written charter approved by the Board that specifies the HRCC's duties and responsibilities, which is available on our website at: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/hrcc_charter.pdf. In accordance with its charter, the HRCC oversees our programs that foster executive and employee development and retention, with emphasis on leadership development, management capabilities, succession plans and human capital management. The HRCC also determines executive and director compensation, and oversees significant employee benefits programs, policies and plans. 
Each member of the HRCC has been determined to be independent under Nasdaq, SEC and Internal Revenue Code rules. The HRCC may delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees. See "Board Meetings and Committees" for more information about the HRCC. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The HRCC has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. For fiscal 2018, the HRCC engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group ("Semler Brossy") as its independent executive compensation consultant. 
Applied Materials, Inc.    37 
Semler Brossy, who reports directly to the HRCC and not to management, is independent from Applied, has not provided any services to Applied other than to the HRCC and receives compensation from Applied only for services provided to the HRCC. The HRCC assessed the independence of Semler Brossy pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that the work of Semler Brossy for the HRCC has not raised any conflict of interest. 
Semler Brossy reviews and advises on all principal aspects of the executive compensation program. Its main responsibilities are as follows: 
The HRCC typically asks Semler Brossy to attend the HRCC's meetings, including executive sessions at which management is not present. Semler Brossy communicates regularly with the HRCC Chair outside of committee meetings and also meets with management to gather information and review proposals. 
Role of Executive Officers and Management in Compensation Decisions 
For fiscal 2018, the HRCC invited Mr. Dickerson (as CEO) and other executives, including the heads of Global Human Resources and Global Rewards, to attend its meetings. The HRCC also regularly held executive sessions without management present. The CEO, together with the HRCC, assesses the performance of our NEOs and other executive officers. The CEO presents to the HRCC his evaluation of each executive officer's performance over the past year and makes recommendations to the HRCC regarding base salaries, bonus targets and actual payments, performance goals and weightings, and long-term incentive awards for executive officers. The HRCC considers these recommendations in making its final determinations, in addition to considering input from Semler Brossy. The HRCC discusses the CEO's proposed compensation and makes final decisions regarding the CEO's compensation when he is not present. 
Additional Compensation Programs and Policies 
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan 
Our 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP") allows our NEOs and other eligible employees to voluntarily defer on a pre-tax basis a portion of their eligible earnings. We do not provide matching or other employer contributions to our executive officers under this plan. Deferrals made prior to October 2015 under the DCP are credited with deemed interest and are subject to the distribution rules in place prior to the plan amendment in October 2015. Beginning in fiscal 2016, participants are permitted to notionally invest new deferrals in certain investment options newly available under the plan. Additionally, for new deferrals, the DCP provides new distribution rules for in-service distributions and upon a qualifying separation from service, disability and change in control. See "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" below for more information about the DCP. 
Retirement Benefits under the 401(k) Plan and Generally Available Benefits Programs 
During fiscal 2018, all full-time and part-time (working 20 or more hours a week) U.S. employees, including the NEOs, were eligible to participate in Applied's 401(k) plan, a tax-qualified retirement plan. Eligible Applied 401(k) plan participants receive matching contributions from Applied. Other than the 401(k) plan, we do not provide defined benefit pension plans or defined contribution retirement plans to the NEOs or other employees, except as required in certain countries outside the U.S. for legal or competitive reasons. Applied offers a number of other benefits programs to a broad base of eligible employees, including a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan, medical, dental and vision insurance, long-term and short-term disability plans, life and accidental death and dismemberment plans, health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, business travel insurance, wellness programs, educational assistance, employee assistance program and certain other country- specific benefits. 
Applied annually benchmarks its overall benefits programs, including the 401(k) plan, against those of our peers. Applied's overall broad-based benefits programs are at approximately the market median, which the HRCC believes allows us to remain competitive in attracting and retaining talent. 
The benefits provided under the programs discussed above are not considered by the HRCC in determining an individual NEO's total compensation. 
38    2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Relocation Program  
Applied maintains a relocation program available to all eligible employees that is consistent with current practices among global companies. Applied provides competitive relocation benefits to ensure it can fill positions critical to its business needs and provide career development opportunities for high-potential employees. Benefits for employees on international assignment include reimbursement on an after-tax basis for housing and transportation allowances and living and travel expense reimbursements. Benefits also include tax equalization that is intended to put employees who relocate in service to Applied in the same position, from a tax-liability perspective, that they would be in if they were still located in the U.S. 
In 2014, at the Board's request, Mr. Dickerson relocated with his family to Japan to continue leading critical efforts toward the then-anticipated completion of a proposed business combination with Tokyo Electron. 
Board Rationale for Relocation. Recognizing the complexity of a U.S.-Japanese merger, including both geographic and cultural differences, the Board felt it was critical to have senior leadership presence from Applied on the ground in Japan to work closely with Tokyo Electron during the regulatory review period and to effect a smooth business combination and increase the likelihood of achieving forecasted business benefits of the merger. The Board considered and determined that the anticipated cost savings that would be generated from the merger would significantly outweigh the expenses to relocate Mr. Dickerson and his family to Japan. 
Relocation Benefits. In accordance with our relocation program that is available to all employees on global assignment, the HRCC approved relocation benefits for Mr. Dickerson, which included amounts for taxes incurred in connection with the relocation, as well as tax equalization for the incremental tax-liability resulting from his relocation to Japan in service of Applied. 
Tax equalization ensures that the tax costs incurred by Mr. Dickerson on the international assignment be equivalent to what the tax costs would have been had he remained in the U.S. Tax payments were not paid to Mr. Dickerson but were paid directly to the appropriate tax authorities. While the amounts of the relocation benefits are attributed to Mr. Dickerson in the Summary Compensation Table, they did not provide any additional compensation to him and are not part of his ongoing pay. 
Disclosure and Payment Timing. Although Mr. Dickerson relocated to Japan for part of 2014 and 2015, the timing and disclosure of relocation payments extend beyond this period. Mr. Dickerson is subject to income taxes in Japan on income earned for the period of time of his international assignment, including continuing Japanese tax liabilities related to his equity awards. Japan assesses income tax on compensation earned while an individual is resident in Japan. Performance shares are deemed earned over the period during which they vest and stock options are deemed earned from grant to exercise. Mr. Dickerson has an outstanding stock option award, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal 2020, as well as performance shares, that he earned during the period of his international assignment in Japan. Applied, in connection with providing tax equalization benefits to Mr. Dickerson under the relocation program, will be responsible for incremental taxes in connection with the vesting of the performance shares and the stock option award when it is exercised by Mr. Dickerson. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We have stock ownership guidelines to help align the interests of our Section 16 officers on the CEO Executive Staff with those of our shareholders. The guidelines provide that officers should meet the following ownership levels in Applied common stock: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO      6x base salary   
 Other Officers      3x base salary   
[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, each officer was in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. 
Hedging and Pledging Prohibitions 
Applied has an insider trading policy that, among other things, prohibits all of our employees and directors from engaging in hedging or other speculative transactions relating to Applied shares, and prohibits directors and NEOs from pledging their Applied shares. 
Clawback Policy 
We have a "clawback" policy that allows the Board to require reimbursement of incentive compensation from an executive officer in the event intentional misconduct by the officer is determined to be the primary cause of a material negative restatement of Applied's financial results. The compensation that may be recovered is the after-tax portion of any bonus paid to, and any performance-based equity awards earned by, the NEO within the 12 months after filing of the financial statements, if the compensation would not have been paid to the NEO had Applied's financial results been reported properly. The policy applies to financial statements filed in a rolling three-year, look-back period. This clawback policy is in addition to any policies or recovery rights that are required under applicable laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Tax Deductibility 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the recently-exacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, restricts 
Applied Materials, Inc.    39 
 deductibility for federal income tax purposes of annual individual compensation in excess of $1 million to each NEO, effective for tax years beginning after 2017, subject to a transition rule for certain written binding contracts which were in effect on November 2, 2017, and which were not modified in any material respect on or after such date. In the past, Section 162(m)'s deductibility limitation was subject to an exception for compensation that qualified as 'performance-based'. Our compensation programs were designed to permit Applied to qualify for the performance-based exception, although the Company reserved the right to pay compensation that did not qualify as 'performance-based'. While the HRCC will continue to consider the deductibility of compensation as a factor in making compensation decisions, it retains the flexibility to provide compensation that is consistent with the Company's goals for its executive compensation program, even if such compensation would not be fully tax-deductible. 
HUMAN RESOURCES AND 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that Applied specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act. 
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for fiscal 2018. Based on the review and discussions, the Human Resources and Compensation 
 Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in Applied's Proxy Statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
Applied's 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"), restated effective October 12, 2015 (the "Restatement Date") and formerly known as the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees, including executive officers, to voluntarily defer receipt of all or a portion of their: (1) eligible sign-on bonus payments, if any, (2) up to 40% of their base salaries, (3) eligible annual bonus payments, if any, and (4) eligible severance payments, if any. 
Deferrals made prior to the Restatement Date are retained as separate "rollover" accounts under the DCP. These deferrals continue to be credited with deemed interest in the sum of 
 (a) the yield-to-maturity of five-year U.S. Treasury notes, plus (b) 1.50%. The deemed interest rate under the DCP for fiscal 2018 was 3.40% from October 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and 3.61% from January 1, 2018 to October 28, 2018. Deferred amounts in the rollover accounts, plus deemed interest thereon, are generally payable on the same date selected by the participants or specified prior to the Restatement Date under the terms of the DCP. Beginning in fiscal 2016, new deferrals under the DCP are credited with deemed investment returns, gains or losses based upon investment crediting options newly available under the DCP. Applied does not make any matching or other employer contributions to the plan for our executive officers. 
44    2019 Proxy Statement 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Under the DCP, a change in control (as defined prior to the Restatement Date), would trigger the distribution of all deferred balances in the rollover accounts. For new account balances after the Restatement Date, the DCP provides new distribution rules for in-service distribution options and upon a qualifying separation from service, disability and change in control, including the option to change the time and form of payment within three (3) months following a change in control, as such term is defined in the DCP. Distributions are payable from the general assets of Applied or from the assets of a grantor trust (known as a rabbi trust) established by Applied.

Employment Agreement 
Applied does not have employment agreements with any of its NEOs, other than an agreement with Mr. Dickerson. The agreement with Mr. Dickerson was entered into in connection with his appointment as President and CEO. 
Mr. Dickerson's employment agreement, dated August 14, 2013, provides that if Applied terminates his employment other than for cause and other than due to death or disability, he would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 275% of his base salary, provided that he executes an agreement containing a release of claims and non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions in favor of Applied. 
For purposes of Mr. Dickerson's agreement, "cause" generally means the willful failure to perform his duties after written notice and an opportunity to cure; the willful commission of a wrongful act that caused, or was reasonably likely to cause, substantial damage to Applied, or an act of fraud in the performance of his duties; conviction for the commission of a felony in connection with the performance of his duties; or the order of a federal or state regulatory authority requiring the termination of his employment.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
Applied does not currently have change of control agreements or arrangements with any of its NEOs. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination. Under Mr. Dickerson's employment agreement described above, he would have been entitled to receive $2,750,000 (275% of his annual base salary at the end of fiscal 2018) had Applied terminated his employment without cause on October 26, 2018, the last business day of fiscal 2018. No other NEO was entitled to receive severance payment under an employment agreement in effect on October 26, 2018. 
Vesting Acceleration under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan. Our Stock Plan provides that the vesting of equity awards granted under the plan to employees, including the NEOs, will be accelerated in full upon a change of control of Applied if the successor corporation (or its parent or subsidiary) does not assume or provide a substitute for the outstanding awards. Separately, equity awards will be accelerated in full if the award holder is terminated without cause or resigns employment with Applied for good reason, in each case, within 12 months following a change of control of Applied. This double-trigger accelerated vesting does not apply if the applicable award agreement specifically states that it will not apply or if the participant's employment is terminated due to his or her death or disability, resignation without good reason or termination for cause. 
The following table shows the amounts attributable to the accelerated vesting of equity awards under the Stock Plan following a change of control in which the awards are not assumed or substituted for, or within 12 months following a change of control in which the NEO is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, in each case assuming the change of control and termination or resignation occurred on October 26, 2018, the last business day of fiscal 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than the CEO). The fiscal 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Dickerson, was $14,064,540, the fiscal 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee (other than the CEO) was $113,999, and the ratio of these amounts was 123 to 1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system of record and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
For purposes of identifying our median compensated employee, we used our global employee population as of October 28, 2018, the last day of fiscal 2018, identified based on our human resources system of record. We used total direct compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure for such population. In this context, total direct compensation means the sum of the applicable base salary determined as of October 28, 2018, the annual incentive earned for service in fiscal 2018, and the approved value of the annual equity awards granted during fiscal 2018, not including off-cycle grants in the case of new hires, promotions or similar circumstances. Given its global population, the Company used the average foreign currency exchange rates during the fiscal year for salary and the rates in effect at the end of fiscal 2018 for the annual incentive. After identifying our median compensated employee, we then calculated the annual total compensation for our median compensated employee using the same methodology used for our CEO as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Applied's Audit Committee is responsible for review, approval, or ratification of "related person transactions" involving Applied or its subsidiaries and related persons. Under SEC rules, a related person is a director, officer, nominee for director, or 5% shareholder of a company since the beginning of the previous fiscal year, and his or her immediate family members. Applied has adopted written policies and procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which (1) Applied or a subsidiary is a participant, (2) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (3) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. 
In accordance with these policies and procedures, the Audit Committee determines whether the related person has a material interest in a transaction and may, in its discretion, approve, ratify or take other action with respect to the transaction. The Audit Committee reviews all material facts related to the transaction and takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, and the purpose and the potential benefits to Applied of the transaction. 
In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee to review and approve transactions in accordance with specified criteria, if advance review by the Audit Committee is not feasible. Any transactions approved by the Chair must be reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly-scheduled meeting. 
The Audit Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals for limited transactions with related persons. Pre-approved transactions are as follows:

We are asking shareholders to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as Applied's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, which began on October 29, 2018 and will end on October 27, 2019. Although ratification is not legally required, Applied is submitting the appointment of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. In the event that this appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee of the Board will reconsider the appointment. 
The Audit Committee appoints the independent registered public accounting firm annually. Before appointing KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, the Audit Committee considered the firm's qualifications and performance during fiscal 2018 and 2017. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and pre-approved audit and permissible non-audit services performed by KPMG in fiscal 2018 and 2017, as well as the fees paid to KPMG for such services. In its review of non-audit service fees and its appointment of KPMG as Applied's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of such services was compatible with maintaining KPMG's independence. 
Representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting. They will be given an opportunity to make a statement if they wish and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Fees Paid to KPMG LLP 
The following table shows fees paid by Applied for professional services rendered by KPMG for fiscal 2018 and 2017, which ended on October 28, 2018 and October 29, 2017, respectively. All of the fees shown in the table were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with its pre-approval process. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 7,776      $ 6,354   
 Audit-Related Fees      342        322   
 Tax Fees:                   
 Tax Compliance and Review      644        440   
 Tax Planning and Advice      236        3   
 All Other Fees      50        —     
 Total Fees    $ 9,048      $ 7,119   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees consisted of fees for (a) professional services rendered for the annual audit of Applied's consolidated financial statements, (b) review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports and (c) services that are typically provided by an independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 
Audit-Related Fees included fees for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of Applied's consolidated financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." Audit-related fees also included fees incurred for services in connection with compliance with government-funded grant requirements, audits of financial statements of certain employee benefit plans and accounting consultations related to proposed new accounting standards. 
Tax Fees consisted of fees for professional services for tax compliance and review, and tax planning and advice. Tax compliance and review services consisted of federal, state and international tax compliance, assistance with tax audits and appeals, and assistance with customs and duties audits. Tax planning and advice services consisted of consultations related to tax compliance matters and certain international operations. 
All Other Fees for fiscal 2018 consisted of fees for services in connection with a contract compliance audit. 
The Audit Committee has concluded that the provision of the non-audit services described above was compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG.

PROPOSAL 3—RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Policy on Audit Committee's Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee reviews and, as appropriate, pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services and tax services, as well as specifically designated non-audit services which, in the opinion of the Audit Committee, will not impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. Pre-approval generally is provided for up to one year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and generally is subject to a specific budget. The independent registered public accounting firm and Applied's management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, including the fees for the services performed to date. In addition, the Audit Committee also may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis, as necessary or appropriate.

PROPOSAL 4—SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FOR RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT 
Kenneth Steiner, whose address and stockholding will be provided by us upon request, has submitted the following proposal. The shareholder proposal will be voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the proponent. 
Applied is not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal and supporting statement, which are presented below as received from the proponent. 
We conducted extensive shareholder outreach efforts to solicit shareholder views on the desirability of action by written consent during the fall of 2018. Please see page 13 for a summary of the input we received from shareholders. Based upon shareholder input, our Governance Committee determined that providing for a right to act by written consent is not warranted. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. 
Shareholder Proposal 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Proposal 4 – Shareholder Right to Act by Written Consent   Shareholders request that our board of directors  undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were  present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any  appropriate topic for written consent.   Taking  action by written consent in place of a special meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle and avoid the cost of a special meeting.   This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at  13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate  and Sprint if small shareholders had the same access to independent corporate governance data as large shareholders.         A proposal on this same topic won 48%-support from Applied Materials  shareholders in 2017. If more shareholders had access to independent corporate governance data the near-majority 48%-vote would have been higher.   Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director. This may be of greater importance since the board of directors approved  $6 billion of stock repurchases in 2018. Directors at some companies authorize stock buybacks because of personal incentives tied to short-term metrics, such as earnings per share, at the cost of long-term value creation.   The expectation for this proposal is that shareholders will not need to make  use of it because its mere existence will be an incentive factor that will help ensue that the future of Applied Materials is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management.

Please vote yes:   Shareholder Right to Act by Written Consent –  Proposal 4 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST Proposal 4 for the following reasons: 
The Board is committed to strong corporate governance and responsiveness to Applied's shareholders, and believes in maintaining policies and practices that serve the best interests of all shareholders. Following careful review and consideration, the Board has determined that support for this shareholder proposal is unwarranted, and further continues to believe that this written consent proposal would unfairly enable holders to circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all shareholders through our existing shareholder meeting process in a way that may be detrimental to our shareholders. 
Applied is committed to strong corporate governance practices and has meaningful shareholder rights in place. Applied's shareholders have the ability to call special 
50    2019 Proxy Statement 
PROPOSAL 4—SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FOR RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT 
 meetings, propose actions for consideration at annual meetings, and can nominate directors through proxy access. The Board believes that these rights provide meaningful accountability and establish a democratic process for all shareholders, unlike a written consent right which can be used in a way that disenfranchises shareholders. 
During the fall of 2018, at the request of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, we conducted extensive shareholder outreach efforts to solicit shareholder views on the desirability of action by written consent. We contacted the holders of approximately 45% of our outstanding shares, and engaged in active discussions with holders representing 29% of our outstanding shares. While some shareholders indicated general support for action by written consent, a substantial portion of shareholders with whom we engaged expressed the following: 
Shareholder Interests are Better Served under Existing Special Meeting Right 
The Board believes that Applied's shareholders are best served by holding meetings in which all shareholders are provided with notice of the meeting and an opportunity to consider and discuss the proposed actions and vote their shares. In 2015, Applied implemented a shareholder right to call special meetings following an extensive shareholder outreach effort to hear directly from shareholders. Applied's Bylaws provide that special meetings of Applied's shareholders may be called at the request of the holders of 20% of Applied's outstanding common stock (an ownership threshold supported by an overwhelming majority of the shareholders that responded to the outreach), without limitations on aggregation of ownership or minimum holding periods. This is less than one-half of the percentage of shareholders that would be necessary to act by written consent under the shareholder proposal. Any group of investors proposing to act by written consent could call a special meeting. This special meeting right provides Applied's shareholders a meaningful ability to propose actions for shareholder consideration between annual meetings. Shareholders also have the ability to propose actions for consideration and vote at annual meetings. 
All Applied shareholders have the opportunity to participate in annual shareholder meetings and any special shareholder meetings. These shareholder meetings offer important protections and advantages that are absent from the written consent process: 
Action by Written Consent Can Disenfranchise Shareholders 
In contrast, adoption of this proposal would make it possible for the holders of a bare majority of the shares of Applied's outstanding common stock to act alone and take significant corporate actions without any fiduciary duties to other shareholders, without any prior notice to Applied or other Applied shareholders, and without giving all shareholders an opportunity to consider and vote on shareholder actions that may have important ramifications for both Applied and its shareholders. This approach would effectively disenfranchise all of those shareholders who do not have, or are not given, the opportunity to participate in the written consent, and who may not be informed about the proposed action until after it has already been taken. 
If this proposal were implemented, proposed shareholder actions involving important decisions could be approved without the important safeguard of advance notice to all Applied shareholders, and without the benefit of enabling all shareholders to consider arguments for and against, express their views, and vote. This written consent procedure could also result in multiple consents being solicited simultaneously on a range of issues, putting shareholders at risk of confusion and resulting in duplicative or contradictory actions. Multiple shareholders could also solicit written consents as frequently as they choose, all of which could result in Applied incurring 
Applied Materials, Inc.    51 
 significant expense and administrative burden with little to no benefit to shareholders. Action by written consent could be used to facilitate very short-term speculation in Applied's common shares or other narrow self-interests, which could be at odds with long-term, sustainable interests of Applied's shareholders. The Board believes that the written consent procedure is more appropriate for a closely-held corporation with a small number of shareholders, and not for a widely- held public company such as Applied. 
Current Strong Corporate Governance Practices Demonstrate Responsiveness and Accountability 
The Board further believes that Applied's strong corporate governance practices make adoption of this proposal unnecessary. In addition to giving shareholders an expansive right to call special meetings, Applied's corporate governance practices provide transparency and accountability of the Board to all Applied shareholders, and demonstrate that Applied is responsive to shareholder concerns:

       owning 3% or more of Applied's common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in Applied's proxy statement director nominees constituting up to 20% of the  Board (or at least two director nominees).  
[END TABLE]
In light of Applied's strong corporate governance practices, including the existing right of shareholders to call special meetings, and the ability of shareholders to nominate directors through proxy access, the Board believes that adoption of the shareholder proposal is unnecessary and is not in the best interests of Applied and its shareholders.

At the time this Proxy Statement was mailed, we were not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those set forth in this Proxy Statement and in the notice accompanying this Proxy Statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the record date? How many shares are entitled to vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Shareholders who owned Applied common stock at the close of business on January 10, 2019, the  record date, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, there were 953,856,435 shares of Applied common stock outstanding. Each share of Applied common stock is entitled to one vote for each director nominee and one vote for  each of the proposals to be voted on.  
[END TABLE]
A complete list of these shareholders will be available at our corporate offices at 3050 Bowers Avenue, Building 1, Santa Clara, California 95054 during regular business hours for the ten days prior to the Annual Meeting. This list also will be available during the Annual Meeting at the meeting location. A shareholder may examine the list for any legally valid purpose related to the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial  owner?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Most Applied shareholders hold their shares as beneficial owners (through a broker, bank, or other  nominee) rather than as a shareholder of record (directly in their own name).  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with Applied's transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you. As a shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to Applied or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you requested printed proxy materials, we have enclosed an accompanying proxy card for you to use. You may also 
Applied Materials, Inc.    53 
 submit voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the accompanying proxy card, as described below under "How can I vote my shares?" 
Beneficial Owners. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank, or other nominee, which is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank, or other nominee on how to vote the shares in your account. However, because you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting, unless you request and provide at the Annual Meeting a valid proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee. Your broker, bank, or other nominee has included a voting instruction form for you to use to direct them how to vote your shares. Please instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee how to vote your shares using the voting instruction form you received from them. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I attend the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Applied shareholders on the record date or their legal proxy holders may attend the Annual Meeting.  To be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you will need a form of photo identification and valid proof of ownership of Applied common stock or a valid legal proxy. If you have a legal proxy from a shareholder of record, you must bring a form of photo  identification and the legal proxy to the Annual Meeting. If you have a legal proxy from a street name shareholder, you must bring a form of photo identification, a legal proxy from the record holder (i.e., the bank, broker or other holder of  record) to the street name shareholder that is assignable, and the legal proxy from the street name shareholder to you. Each shareholder may appoint only one proxy holder to attend on such shareholder's behalf.  
[END TABLE]
The use of cameras, recording equipment and other electronic devices (including cell phones, tablets, laptops, etc.) is not permitted at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You may vote over the Internet, by telephone, by mail, or in person at the Annual Meeting. Votes  submitted by telephone or over the Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, March 6, 2019, unless otherwise indicated.  
[END TABLE]
Voting over the Internet. To vote over the Internet, please follow either the instructions included on your proxy card or the voting instructions you receive by e-mail or that are being provided via the Internet. If you vote over the 
 Internet, you do not need to complete and mail a proxy card. 
Voting by Telephone. If you have requested printed proxy materials, such materials will include instructions for how to vote by telephone. Please follow either the instructions included on your proxy card or voting instruction form. If you vote by telephone, you do not need to complete and mail a proxy card. 
Voting by Mail. If you have requested printed proxy materials, you may vote by mail by signing the proxy card and returning it in the prepaid and addressed envelope enclosed with the proxy materials. By signing and returning the proxy card, you are authorizing the individuals named on the proxy card to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner you indicate. We encourage you to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting so that your shares will be voted if you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting. If you receive more than one proxy card, it is an indication that your shares are held in multiple accounts. Please sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
Voting in Person at the Meeting. If you attend the Annual Meeting and plan to vote in person, we will provide you with a ballot at the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you have the right to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to bring to the Annual Meeting a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee authorizing you to vote those shares. 
Applied Employee Plan Participants. If you own shares purchased through Applied's Employees' Stock Purchase Plan or Applied's Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees that are still held by the plans' recordkeeper and you do not vote these shares, the shares may be voted in accordance with standard brokerage industry practices only on routine matters. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Q:  What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote as of the record date must be present at the  Annual Meeting to constitute a quorum and in order to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. Your shares are counted as present if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting, over the Internet, by telephone, or by submitting a properly executed proxy  card by mail.  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each of  the director nominees. If you elect to abstain from voting on the election of directors, the abstention will not have any effect on the election of directors. In tabulating the voting results for the election of directors, only "FOR" and  "AGAINST" votes are counted.  
[END TABLE]
You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN" with respect to: 
If you elect to abstain from voting on any of these three proposals, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote with respect to such proposals. 
If you are a shareholder of record and you sign and return your proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted on the proposals as recommended by our Board and in accordance with the discretion of the persons named on the proxy card with respect to any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker on a timely basis on how to vote your shares, your brokerage firm, in its discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on routine matters. Only the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is a routine matter. Without your voting instructions, your brokerage firm cannot vote your shares on any other proposal. These unvoted shares, called "broker non-votes," refer to shares held by brokers who have not received voting instructions from their clients and who do not have discretionary authority to vote on non-routine matters. Broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote and will not affect the outcome of the vote on non-routine proposals. Broker non-votes will not have an effect on the election of any director nominee.

Solicitations may be made personally or by mail, facsimile, telephone, messenger, or  via the Internet. In addition to the estimated proxy solicitation cost of $20,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for this service, we will reimburse brokerage  firms and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding the proxy materials to shareholders.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail  regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In accordance with SEC rules, we are furnishing proxy materials to our shareholders primarily via  the Internet,   
[END TABLE]
This process is designed to expedite shareholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the cost of the Annual Meeting and help conserve natural resources.

Q:  I share an address with another shareholder and we received only one paper copy of the proxy  materials. How can I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Under a practice approved by the SEC called "householding," shareholders who have the same  address and last name and who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one mailed copy of our proxy materials, unless one or more of these shareholders notifies us that he or she wishes to receive individual  copies. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.

OTHER MATTERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires Applied's directors and executive officers, and holders of more than 10% of Applied common stock to file with the SEC reports about their ownership of common stock and other equity securities of Applied. Such directors, officers and 10% shareholders are required by SEC rules to furnish Applied with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
SEC rules require us to identify in this Proxy Statement anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent fiscal year. Based on our review of forms we received and written representations from certain of the reporting persons, we believe that during fiscal 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were satisfied on a timely basis.

If a shareholder would like us to consider including a proposal in the proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, the proposal must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices on or before September 26, 2019.

1  Amounts for fiscal 2017 included the recognition of the previously unrecognized foreign tax  credits. Amounts for fiscal 2015 included an adjustment to decrease the provision for income taxes by $28 million with a corresponding increase in net income, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.02. The adjustment was  excluded in Applied's non-GAAP adjusted results and was made primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the U.S. related to intercompany sales, which resulted in overstating  profitability in the U.S. and the provision for income taxes in immaterial amounts in each year since fiscal 2010.  
2  These items are incremental charges attributable to acquisitions, consisting of amortization of  purchased intangible assets.  
3  These items are incremental charges related to the terminated business combination agreement with  Tokyo Electron Limited, consisting of acquisition-related and integration planning costs.

Use of Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Measures 
Management uses non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the Company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors' ability to review the Company's business from the same perspective as the Company's management and facilitate comparisons of results for the periods presented on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Applied's ongoing operating performance. 
The non-GAAP adjusted financial measures presented above are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. Additionally, fiscal 2018 non-GAAP results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with recent U.S. tax legislation. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables presented above. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
