      General         
          At the 2018 annual meeting, our stockholders approved a proposal to declassify our board and elected our Class II directors to serve a term that expires at the Annual Meeting. Since the declassification did not shorten the existing terms of our directors, at the Annual Meeting, the directors elected at the 2018 annual meeting and the Class III directors whose term expires at Annual Meeting will stand for election for terms of one year (a term that expires at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders) and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. At the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020, the board will cease to be classified and all directors will be elected to serve terms expiring upon the next annual meeting of stockholders following their election and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. 
          If you sign and return the accompanying proxy card, your shares will be voted for the election of the six nominees recommended by the board unless you choose to withhold from voting for any of the nominees. If for any reason any nominee is unable to serve or will not serve, such proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the board as the proxy holder may determine. The board is not aware of any nominee who will be unable to or will not serve as a director. There is no cumulative voting.

      Director Nominees         
          A nominee must receive the vote of a plurality of the votes validly cast at the Annual Meeting represented either in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to be elected. Therefore, the six nominees who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) will be elected. Notwithstanding such election, each of the six nominees for election to the board has agreed to tender to the board his or her resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results in the event such nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (see "Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees" below for details regarding the board's majority voting policy). Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. The nominees are as follows:

          Additional qualifications, experience, and other information about the six director nominees, as well as the current members of the board who will continue to serve after the Annual Meeting, is provided on pages 18-20. There are no agreements or arrangements between third parties and any of our directors, including the nominees, which provide for compensation or other payment in connection with the director's candidacy or service as a director. There are no family relationships between any director, executive officer, or director nominee. 
      Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees         
          The full text of the board's majority voting policy for director nominees is set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website at  http://ir.hdsupply.com/corporate-governance.
          Each of the six nominees for election as directors has agreed to tender to the board his or her resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results in the event such nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or election than votes "for" his or her election (a "Majority Withheld Vote"). Neither abstentions nor broker non-votes are deemed to be votes for or withheld from a director's election. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any tendered resignation and recommend to the board whether to accept or reject it. The board will act on each tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, at its next regularly scheduled board meeting following the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, when making its recommendation, and the board, when making its decision, may consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate, including, without limitation, the reasons (if any) given by stockholders as to why they withheld their votes, the qualifications of the tendering director, his or her contributions to the board and the Company, and the results of the most recent evaluation of the tendering director's performance by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and other board members.

          The board will promptly and publicly disclose (1) its decision whether to accept or reject the director's tendered resignation, and (2) if rejected by the board, the board's reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. Any director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or board action regarding whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. If a director's tendered resignation is rejected by the board, the director will continue to serve for the remainder of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal. If a director's tendered resignation is accepted by the board, then the board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the number of directors comprising the board, in each case pursuant to the provisions of, and to the extent permitted by, the Bylaws. 
          The board will consider as candidates for nomination for election or reelection to the board, or to fill vacancies and new directorships on the board, only those individuals who agree to tender, promptly following their election, reelection, or appointment, an irrevocable resignation that will be effective upon (i) the occurrence of a Majority Withheld Vote for that director and (ii) acceptance of the tendered resignation by the board. Each of the director nominees have signed such an irrevocable resignation.

          We are seeking your vote to approve the HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

If approved by our stockholders, the plan will become effective on the first day of the first offering period beginning after the Annual Meeting. If our stockholders do not approve the plan, it will not become effective. The plan authorizes an additional 709,674 shares, plus the 1,490,326 remaining authorized shares as of the record date, for a total of 2.2 million shares. We anticipate that the requested shares should provide us with the ability to grant share purchase rights for approximately five years.

          The primary purpose of the plan is to encourage ownership of our common stock by eligible employees of HD Supply and its controlled subsidiaries and partnerships. Specifically, the plan provides eligible employees an opportunity to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of our common stock on periodic purchase dates at a discount. The board believes that the plan is a valued benefit for our eligible employee base. We believe that allowing employees to purchase shares of our common stock through the plan motivates high levels of performance and provides an effective means of encouraging employee commitment to our success and aids in recruiting new employees.

          The accompanying proxy materials have been furnished to you because the Company is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement describes issues on which we would like you to vote at our Annual Meeting. It also gives you information on these issues so that you can make an informed decision. 
          The proxy materials include the notice and proxy statement for the Annual Meeting, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019, the proxy card for the Annual Meeting, and directions on attending the Annual Meeting. The Company has made these proxy materials available to you by Internet, or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, because you owned shares of Company common stock at the close of business on the March 25, 2019 record date. 
          When you vote via the Internet, or by signing and returning the proxy card, you appoint Dan S. McDevitt and James F. Brumsey as your representatives at the Annual Meeting, with full power of substitution. They will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them or, if an issue that is not on the proxy card comes up for vote, in accordance with their best judgment, and as permitted by applicable law. This way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance via Internet, or if you received your proxy card by mail, by signing and returning your proxy card. If you vote via Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. 
   Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
          In accordance with rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company uses the Internet as the primary means of furnishing proxy materials to stockholders. Accordingly, the Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to the Company's stockholders. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on

the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or how to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. The Company encourages stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of its annual meetings and reduce the cost to the Company of physically printing and mailing materials. 
   Who is entitled to vote?  
          Holders of our common stock at the close of business on March 25, 2019 are entitled to vote. March 25, 2019 is referred to as the record date. In accordance with Delaware law, a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available in electronic form at the place of the Annual Meeting on May 21, 2019 and will be accessible in electronic form for ten days before the meeting at our principal place of business, 3400 Cumberland Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30339 between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. 
   Each share of common stock is entitled to how many votes?  
          Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. On the record date, there were 170,753,038 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
   How do I vote?  
          If you are a registered stockholder, which means you hold your shares (including any restricted shares) in certificate form or through an account with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you have the following options for voting before the Annual Meeting: 
          If you are a beneficial holder, meaning you hold your shares in "street name" through an account with a bank or broker, your ability to vote via the Internet or by telephone depends on the voting procedures of your bank or broker. Please follow the directions on the voting instruction form that your bank or broker provides. 
          Stockholders may also attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. The method you use to vote will not limit your right to vote at the Annual Meeting if you decide to attend in person. Written ballots will be passed out to anyone who wants to vote at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares in "street name," you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Please refer to the notice and voting instruction form, or other information forwarded by your bank or broker, for details on how to request a proxy.

   Is my vote confidential?  
          Confidential voting applies to individual stockholders but not to corporate and institutional stockholders. Our confidential voting policy is set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines available at http://ir.hdsupply.com/corporate-governance.

   How many votes do you need to hold the Annual Meeting?  
          The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. A quorum must be present to conduct business at the Annual Meeting.

other business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. No cumulative voting rights are authorized, and dissenters' rights are not applicable to these matters. 
   How does the board of directors recommend that I vote?  
          The board recommends that you vote:
   How may I vote in the election of directors, and how many votes must the nominees receive to be elected?  
          With respect to the election of directors, you may:
          The Company's Bylaws provide for the election of directors by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the six individuals nominated for election to the board who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) will be elected. Notwithstanding such election, each of the six nominees for election as directors has agreed to tender to the board his or her resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results if he or she receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (see "Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees" on page 5 for details regarding the board's majority voting policy). 
   What happens if a nominee is unable to stand for election?  
          If a nominee is unable to stand for election, the board may either:
          If the board designates a substitute nominee, shares represented by proxies voted for the nominee who is unable to stand for election will be voted for the substitute nominee. 
   How may I vote for the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, and how many votes must this proposal receive to pass?  
          With respect to this proposal, you may:

          In order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that could be cast at the Annual Meeting by the shares present in person, electronically, or by proxy and entitled to vote. If you abstain from voting on the proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. 
   How may I vote for the proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan?  
          With respect to this proposal, you may:
          In order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that could be cast at the Annual Meeting by the shares present in person, electronically, or by proxy and entitled to vote. If you abstain from voting on the proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. 
   Will my shares be voted if I do not vote via the Internet, telephone, by signing and returning my proxy card, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person?  
          If you do not vote via the Internet, by telephone (certain beneficial stockholders), by signing and returning your proxy card, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, then your shares will not be voted and will not count in deciding the matters presented for stockholder consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
          Under certain circumstances and in accordance with NASDAQ rules that govern banks and brokers, if your shares are held in street name through a bank or broker, your bank or broker may vote your shares if you do not provide voting instructions before the Annual Meeting. These circumstances include voting your shares on "routine matters," such as the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm described in this proxy statement. With respect to this proposal, therefore, if you do not vote your shares, your bank or broker may vote your shares on your behalf or leave your shares unvoted. 
          The remaining proposals, namely the election of director nominees and approval of the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, are not considered routine matters under NASDAQ rules relating to voting by banks and brokers. When a proposal is not a routine matter and the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is called a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes at the Annual Meeting will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will have no effect on the outcome of the proposals being voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
          We encourage you to provide instructions to your bank or brokerage firm by voting your proxy. This action ensures that your shares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your wishes.

   What is the vote required for each proposal to pass, and what is the effect of abstentions and uninstructed shares on the proposals?  
          Our Bylaws provide for the election of directors by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that the six individuals nominated for election to the board who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically, or by proxy) will be elected. Notwithstanding such election, each of the six nominees for election has agreed to tender his or her resignation as a director to the board promptly following the certification of election results if he or she receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (see "Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees" on page 5 for details regarding the board's majority voting policy). For the proposal to ratify our independent registered public accounting firm and the proposal to approve the Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan to pass in accordance with our Bylaws, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes that could be cast at the Annual Meeting by the shares present in person, electronically, or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. 
          The following table summarizes the board's recommendation on each proposal, the vote required for each proposal to pass, and the effect abstentions or uninstructed shares (proxy card returned, but voting instructions not provided) have on each proposal. 
   What do I need to attend the Annual Meeting in person?  
          You must bring your admittance ticket (the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that you received in the mail), proof of your share ownership as of March 25, 2019 (such as a brokerage statement or letter from your broker), and government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license). If you do not have an admittance ticket, proof of ownership, or a valid photo identification, you will not be admitted to the Annual Meeting. Cameras and recording devices are not permitted at the meeting. All bags, briefcases, and packages will be held at registration and will not be allowed in the meeting.

   OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS    
[END TABLE]
The Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides that the board shall consist of not fewer than three nor more than 21 directors, with the exact number to be fixed by the board. The board has fixed the current number of directors at eight, and the Company currently has eight directors. 
          At the 2018 annual meeting, our stockholders approved a management proposal to declassify our board and provide for the annual election of directors. The declassification did not shorten the terms of existing directors. Class I has two directors with a term expiring at the 2020 annual meeting. At the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders in 2020, the board will cease to be classified and all directors will be elected to serve terms expiring upon the next annual meeting of stockholders following their election and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. The terms of the remaining six directors expire at the Annual Meeting. 
          At each annual meeting of the stockholders, the successors of the directors whose terms expire at that meeting are elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders following the year of their election. The board is therefore asking you to elect the six nominees for director whose term expires at the Annual Meeting. Our directors with terms expiring at the Annual Meeting, as noted in the above chart, have been nominated by the board for reelection at the Annual Meeting. See "Proposal 1 — Election of Directors" on page 69. 
          Directors are elected by a plurality vote. Therefore, the six nominees who receive the most "FOR" votes will be elected. Notwithstanding such election, each of the six nominees for election as directors has agreed to tender to the board his or her resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results if he or she receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (see "Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees" on page 5 for details regarding the board's majority voting policy). 
          Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. There is no cumulative voting. If you sign and return the accompanying proxy card, your shares will be voted for the election of the six nominees recommended by the board unless you choose to withhold from voting for any of the nominees. If a nominee is unable to serve or will not serve for any reason, proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. The Company is not aware of any nominee who will be unable to or will not serve as a director. 
          Set forth below is biographical information as well as background information relating to each nominee's and continuing director's business experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills and why the board and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe each individual is a valuable member of our board. The persons who have been nominated for election and are to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting are listed first, with continuing directors following thereafter.

Selecting Nominees for Director  
          Our board has delegated to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee the responsibility for reviewing and recommending nominees for director to the board. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and on recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our board has adopted criteria for the selection of new directors based on the strategic needs of the Company and the board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically review the criteria adopted by the board and, if deemed desirable, recommend changes to the criteria. 
          Pursuant to the criteria adopted by our board, the board seeks members from diverse professional backgrounds who combine a broad spectrum of experience and expertise with a reputation for integrity. Individuals are considered for nomination to the board based on their business and professional experience, judgment, oversight roles held, age, skills, and background. The board also considers the candidate's availability, absence of conflicts, and any applicable independence or experience requirements. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for director, including personal characteristics such as race and gender, as well as diversity in experience and skills relevant to the board's performance of its responsibilities in the oversight of the business. For each of the nominees to the board, the biographies shown above highlight the experiences and qualifications that were among the most important to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in concluding that the nominee should serve as a director of the Company. 
          The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending to the board nominees for election to the board at each annual meeting of stockholders and for identifying one or more candidates to fill any vacancies that may occur on the board. New candidates may be identified through recommendations from independent directors or members of management, search firms, discussions with other persons who may know of suitable candidates to serve on the board, and stockholder recommendations. Evaluations of prospective candidates typically include a review of the candidate's background and qualifications by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, interviews with the committee as a whole, one or more members of the committee, or one or more other board members, and discussions of the committee and the full board. The committee may then recommend, as it deems appropriate, candidates to the full board, with the full board selecting the candidates to be nominated for election by the stockholders or to be elected by the board to fill a vacancy. Where the committee does not make a recommendation, such matter is decided by the board. 
          In accordance with the board's majority voting policy, the board will consider as candidates for nomination for election or reelection to the board, or to fill vacancies and new directorships on the board, only those individuals who agree to tender, promptly following their election, reelection or appointment, an irrevocable resignation that will be effective upon (i) the occurrence of the nominee receiving a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election to the board than votes "for" his or her election and (ii) acceptance of the tendered resignation by the board (see "Majority Voting Policy — Director Nominees" on page 5 for details regarding the board's majority voting policy).

          The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates proposed by stockholders on the same basis as recommendations from other sources. Any stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective candidate for the board for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may do so by submitting the name and qualifications of the prospective candidate in writing to the following address: Dan S. McDevitt, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, HD Supply Holdings, Inc., 3400 Cumberland Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30339. Any such submission should also describe the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that make the prospective candidate a suitable nominee for the board. Our Bylaws set forth the requirements for director nomination by a stockholder of persons for election to the board. These requirements are described under "Other Information for Stockholders" on page 77 of this proxy statement. 
          There are no agreements or arrangements between third parties and any of our directors, including the nominees, which provide for compensation or other payment in connection with the director's candidacy or service as a director. 
Board Refreshment and Diversity  
          The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the composition of our board, including whether any vacancies are expected on our board due to retirement or otherwise, and may make recommendations to the board for consideration. Peter Dorsman, Scott Ostfeld and Lauren Taylor Wolfe joined our board in 2017, bringing fresh and diverse perspectives. Mr. Dorsman brings extensive experience in leading large supply chain and customer service organizations. Mr. Ostfeld brings extensive experience investing in companies and engaging with them to help improve stockholder value, as well as with capital allocation strategy and governance. Ms. Taylor Wolfe's diverse knowledge and experience across various industry verticals and expertise in capital allocation and long-term value investing brings valuable insight to the board. The age, gender, and thought diversity that these new independent directors bring to the board also further enhances the diversity of experience, backgrounds, and opinions represented on the board. We believe the addition of these new directors, combined with our directors who have experience with us, provides a strong balance of deep, historical understanding of our Company and new perspectives, resulting in strong guidance and oversight to our executive management team. 
          We currently have two female directors serving on our board. Kathy Affeldt has served as our independent lead director since March 2018 and as chair of the compensation committee since joining the board in 2014. Lauren Taylor Wolfe serves on the Audit and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. Betsy Atkins served as independent lead director from March 2017 through March 2018 and as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee from August 2015 through her resignation in April 2018. 
Director Independence  
          The board reviewed director independence during fiscal 2018 and considered whether there were any relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company. The board also examined whether there were any relationships between an organization of which a director is a partner, stockholder, or executive officer and the Company. The purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships were inconsistent with a determination that a director is independent. No director is deemed independent unless the board has made an affirmative determination that such director has no relationship which would interfere with the exercise of

independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. When conducting its analysis, the board specifically considered all transactions discussed in "Related Person Transactions" on page 28 of this proxy statement. As a result of this review, the board affirmatively determined that all of its non-employee directors are independent and all directors serving on the standing committees of the board satisfy the independence requirements of NASDAQ and the SEC relating to directors and Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members. 
Executive Sessions of our Non-Management Directors  
          The chairman of the board, or the independent lead director if the chairman is not independent, and the full board separately, have authority to require the board to meet in executive sessions outside the presence of management. The independent directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management at least twice per year. In the absence of an independent chairman, the independent lead director will act as chair at such meetings, and if no lead director has been appointed or if the lead director also is not present, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chairperson shall preside over executive sessions and other meetings of the independent directors. The independent directors met in executive session outside the presence of management three times during fiscal 2018. 
Board Self-Evaluation Process  
          The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the annual board and board committee self-evaluation. For fiscal 2018, the process was conducted by survey at the May meetings, with each director completing a detailed questionnaire providing for quantitative ratings in key areas such as oversight of the Company's: (i) personnel development and succession plans; (ii) business strategy; (iii) risk and opportunities; and (iv) corporate governance. The questionnaire also covered board dynamics and leadership structure. The questionnaire sought subjective comment in each of these and the other areas covered by the questionnaire, to determine board effectiveness and opportunities for improvement. The feedback was provided on an anonymous basis to encourage honest and unrestrained feedback. The survey feedback is discussed with the chairman, independent lead director, and the chair of each board committee to ensure that actionable items are appropriately handled. In addition, all directors were provided a summary of the survey results and the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our independent lead director jointly led a discussion regarding the feedback with the full board. The committee periodically reviews the self-evaluation process in an effort to continually improve board effectiveness. 
Board Leadership Structure  
          As noted in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the board has no policy with respect to the separation of the offices of chairman of the board and chief executive officer. The board believes that it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the chairman and chief executive officer in any way that is in the best interests of the Company at a given point in time. As part of its annual self-evaluation process, the board evaluates whether the board leadership structure provides the optimal structure for the Company. 
          Currently, our chief executive officer, Joseph J. DeAngelo, serves as chairman of the board, and Kathleen J. Affeldt serves as the independent lead director of the board. Our board believes that having a combined chairman/chief executive officer, independent members and chairs for each of our

board committees, and an independent lead director currently provides the best board leadership structure for the Company. This structure, together with our other corporate governance practices, provides strong independent oversight of management while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the Company. Our lead director is an independent, non-employee director who is appointed by the independent directors of the board. 
          Our board appointed Mr. DeAngelo to serve as chairman of the board based on the leadership qualities, management capability, knowledge of the business and industry, and long-term, strategic perspective he has demonstrated as our chief executive officer. The independent directors supported the appointment of Ms. Affeldt as our independent lead director, as she possesses the characteristics and qualities critical for an independent lead director. Having served as chairman of the board of BTE Technologies and as chair of the compensation of public companies, and having significant public board experience, Ms. Affeldt has the qualities and experience desired for an independent lead director — high personal integrity, significant board leadership experience, strong business acumen and operations history, and public company experience. 
          Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the chairman either to be independent or, if not, to be complemented by an independent lead director. A critical element for our board in supporting the current board leadership structure is the simultaneous adoption of robust and transparent duties for the independent lead director. These duties help facilitate our board's independent, objective, effective, and efficient oversight of our Company. Our board believes that an executive chairman working with an independent lead director who has strong, well-defined duties gives our board a strong leadership and corporate governance structure that best serves the needs of the Company today. The respective roles and responsibilities of the chairman of the board and independent lead director are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website at  http://ir.hdsupply.com/corporate-governance. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight  
          Our board has overall responsibility for overseeing our risk management. Under its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing the Company's risk management practices, including the effectiveness of the systems and policies for risk assessment and risk management, the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, any unusual material transactions, and management, internal auditor and independent auditor reviews of the Company's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act policies, procedures and monitoring. The Audit Committee also oversees our corporate compliance and ethics programs, as well as the internal audit function. The board's other committees oversee risks associated with their respective areas of responsibility. For example, the Compensation Committee oversees the potential risks associated with our compensation policies and practices. 
          In addition to the committees' work in overseeing risk management, our full board regularly engages in discussions of the most significant risks that the Company is facing and how these risks are being managed. The board also receives reports on risk management from senior officers of the Company and from the committee chairs. The board reviews periodic assessments from the Company's ongoing enterprise risk management process that are designed to identify potential events that may affect the achievement of the Company's objectives.

          The Company's general counsel reports directly to our chief executive officer, providing the general counsel with visibility into the Company's risk profile. The Company's internal audit staff regularly reports to the Audit Committee, and our general counsel and our vice president of internal audit have regularly scheduled private sessions with the Audit Committee. The board believes that the work undertaken by the committees of the board, together with the work of the full board and our chief executive officer, enables the board to oversee effectively the Company's risk management function. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Committee Charters, and Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics  
          Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website at  http://ir.hdsupply.com/corporate-governance. The charters for each of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are also available on our investor relations website. 
          We have a long-standing commitment to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical principles. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is applicable to all the representatives of our enterprise, including our executive officers and all other employees and agents of our Company and our subsidiary companies, as well as to our directors. A copy of our code of ethics is available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website. Under this code of ethics, our associates are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. Any violation of our code of ethics will be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including dismissal from the Company or prosecution under the law. 
          Our Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers, also available on our investor relations website, applies to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, and any other senior executive or financial officer performing similar functions. Under this executive code of ethics, our executives are required, among other things, to act with honesty and integrity, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; to provide full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the SEC, and in other public communications made by the Company; to comply with applicable laws, governmental rules and regulations, including insider trading laws; and to promote the prompt internal reporting of potential violations or other concerns related to the code of ethics to the chair of the Audit Committee. We have also adopted a policy providing procedures by which our in-house and outside attorneys are to report material violations of applicable U.S. federal or state laws, or a material breach of a fiduciary duty, as required by SEC rules. 
Committees of the Board of Directors  
          Our board has three committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance ("N&CG") Committee. Each current board committee has adopted a charter, available on the corporate governance section of our investor relations website at http://ir.hdsupply.com/corporate-governance.

           Audit Committee.    The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for, among other things, assisting the board in reviewing our financial reporting and other internal control processes, our financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent auditors, and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and our code of ethics. 
          During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee held seven meetings. Each member of our Audit Committee meets the independence requirements of NASDAQ and the SEC, and each is financially literate. Our board has determined that Charles W. Peffer is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the SEC. 
           Compensation Committee.    The Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for, among other things, executive succession planning process, the compensation of our executive officers and directors, approving equity grants and other incentive arrangements, and authorizing employment-related agreements for our executive officers. 
          During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee held five meetings. All directors serving on the Compensation Committee meet NASDAQ independence requirements and the "non-employee director" requirements of SEC Rule 16b-3. For additional information about the Compensation Committee's processes and the role of executive officers and compensation consultants in determining compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 36 of this proxy statement. 
          Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.    The N&CG Committee has the responsibility for identifying and, as appropriate, recommending candidates for election to the board, reviewing the composition of the board and its committees, developing and recommending to the board corporate governance guidelines that are applicable to us, and overseeing board evaluations. 
          During fiscal 2018, the N&CG Committee held four meetings. All directors serving on the N&CG Committee meet NASDAQ independence requirements for nominating and corporate governance committees.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  
          Kathleen J. Affeldt, Peter A. Dorsman, Scott D. Ostfeld, and Patrick R. McNamee were members of the Compensation Committee of our board during fiscal 2018. None of these directors is or was an employee or former employee of the Company. 
          None of our executive officers serves as a member of a board or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers who serve on the Company's board or Compensation Committee. 
Compensation Practices and Risk Management  
          During fiscal 2018, management and the Compensation Committee conducted a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the potential risks associated with our compensation policies and practices with respect to both executive compensation and compensation generally. Based on our approach of compensating our associates for the financial success of the Company as a whole and other elements of our compensation program, we concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage undue risk-taking and do not create any risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We believe that our compensation practices provide a balanced mix of cash and equity, annual and longer-term incentives, and performance metrics that mitigate excessive risk-taking that could diminish our value. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors and Attendance at the Annual Meeting  
          The board held five meetings during fiscal 2018. Each of our directors attended all board meetings, and all meetings of the committees of which he or she was a member, during fiscal 2018. Directors are encouraged to attend our annual meetings and all directors attended the 2018 annual meeting.

Succession Planning and Management Development  
          We are focused on talent development at all levels within our organization. Among the Compensation Committee's key responsibilities is the responsibility to ensure that management establishes and the committee oversees an effective executive succession process. The board regularly reviews the succession plans that support our overall business strategy, with a focus on key positions at the senior officer level. The board recognizes that succession planning and talent management are closely connected to risk management. Potential leaders are given exposure and visibility to board members through formal presentations and informal events. More broadly, the board is regularly updated on key talent indicators for the overall workforce, including through diversity, recruiting, and development programs. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions  
          We have adopted a written related person transactions policy under which related persons, namely our executives, directors, and principal stockholders, and each of their immediate family members, are not permitted to enter into certain transactions, or materially modify or amend an ongoing transaction, with the Company in an amount exceeding $120,000, without the consent of our Audit Committee or a designated member of the Audit Committee. Any request for us to enter into or materially modify or amend such transactions is required to be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration, and approval. All of our directors and executive officers are required to report to our Audit Committee any such related person transaction. In approving or rejecting the proposed transaction, our Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the proposed related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, and, if applicable, the impact on a director's independence. Under the policy, if we should discover related person transactions that have not been approved, our Audit Committee will be notified and will determine the appropriate action, including ratification, rescission, or amendment of the transaction. 
Related Person Transactions  
      Indemnification Agreements         
          We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors. The indemnification agreements provide our directors with contractual rights to the indemnification and expense advancement rights provided under our Bylaws, as well as contractual rights to additional indemnification as provided in the indemnification agreement. 
      Transactions with Other Related Parties         
          In May 2015, James A. Rubright, an independent director, acquired a 24.5% interest in MPC Partnership Holdings, LLC (d/b/a Carroll Organization), which is the managing member of, and owns a minority interest in, affiliated apartment community owners. The Company had a preexisting relationship with the Carroll Organization pursuant to which its affiliated apartment community owners purchased products from the Company. On a consolidated basis, the Carroll Organization's affiliated apartment community owners purchased products from the Company of $5.46 million in fiscal 2018, $3.14 million in fiscal 2017, and $3.71 million in fiscal 2016. These transactions were conducted in the

Communicating with our Board of Directors  
          Any stockholder or interested party who wishes to communicate directly with our board, or with any individual director of our board, may do so by writing to Dan S. McDevitt, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, HD Supply Holdings, Inc., 3400 Cumberland Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30339 or by email at boardcommunications@hdsupply.com. Please specify to whom your letter should be directed. Once the communication is received and reviewed by the Corporate Secretary, it will be promptly forwarded to the addressee, as appropriate. Communications that are not related to the duties and responsibilities of the board, including advertisements, junk mail and mass mailings, solicitations for business, routine customer service complaints, new product or service suggestions, opinion survey pools, requests for employment, requests for contributions, or other inappropriate material will not be forwarded to our directors. Any communication alleging legal, ethical, or compliance issues by management, and any other matter deemed by the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary to be potentially material to the Company, will be promptly forwarded to the chair of the Audit Committee. 
Policy Regarding Certain Transactions in Company Securities  
          Through our Policy for Trading in Company Securities, we prohibit our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in the following types of transactions in Company securities: 
           Short Sales.    Short sales evidence an expectation that the stock value will decline and signals to the market an absence of confidence in a company's short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the seller's incentive to improve company performance. For these reasons, we prohibit our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in short sales of the Company's securities. Moreover, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act generally prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. 
           Publicly Traded Options.    A transaction in publicly traded options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of a stock and may create the appearance of trading based on inside information. Transactions in options may also focus a person on short-term performance at the expense of a company's long-term objectives. Accordingly, we prohibit transactions in puts, calls, or other derivative securities with respect to Company securities. 
           Hedging Transactions.    Hedging and monetization transactions allow a person to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in the stock. Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including, but not limited to, through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, puts, calls, collars, forwards and other derivative instruments, or through the establishment of a short position in a company's securities. These transactions allow the person to continue to own the security, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the person may no longer have the same objectives as a company's other stockholders. We, therefore, prohibit our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in transactions that are designed to, or that may reasonably be expected to, have the effect of hedging or offsetting a decrease in the market value of Company securities.

           Pledging.    Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. A margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in a company's securities pursuant to a blackout period restriction. We, therefore, prohibit our directors, officers and employees from purchasing or borrowing against Company securities on margin, holding Company securities in a margin account, or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan.

          The following tables set forth information as of March 25, 2019 with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by (i) each person known to own beneficially more than five percent of our common stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each of the named executive officers; and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group. We are not aware of any pledges of our common stock which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Company. 
          The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC rules and regulations governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under those rules and regulations, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of the determination date, which in the case of the following table is May 24, 2019. Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing such person's ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other person's percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. 
          The percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 170,753,038 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 25, 2019. 
          Except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table, each of the beneficial owners listed has, to our knowledge, sole voting and investment power with respect to the indicated shares of common stock. 
          The following table sets forth information with respect to any person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our common stock, based on information in Schedule 13Gs filed with the SEC and Company records:

   DIRECTOR COMPENSATION (continued)   
[END TABLE]
          The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the board the compensation of our non-employee directors. Our board establishes non-employee director compensation after considering recommendations made by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and the board review the compensation level of our non-employee directors on a biennial basis. Since 2009, the Company has engaged Pearl Meyer to provide input with respect to our non-employee director compensation, including a market review of the competitiveness of total compensation. For further information, see "Compensation Consultant and Use of Comparator Data" on page 42. We believe that the compensation paid to our non-employee directors is reasonable and appropriate, in line with market practice, and is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders because it allows us to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors which is critical to our long-term success. 
          Director compensation is provided pursuant to our Board of Directors Compensation Policy. Mr. DeAngelo, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, does not receive any compensation for service as a director. The director compensation year runs from the date of each annual stockholders meeting. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Omnibus Incentive Plan approved by our stockholders in May 2017 provides a maximum limit of $750,000 on director compensation (both cash and equity awards) for any board compensation year. The elements of our director compensation program are discussed in more detail below. 
   Equity Compensation  
          Each non-employee director receives an annual equity award in the form of restricted stock units under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan. The number of restricted stock units is determined by dividing $130,000 ($190,000 for the independent lead director) by the closing stock price of a share of our common stock on the grant date, which is the date of our annual stockholders meeting. Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of our common stock. The restricted stock units vest on the earliest of: (1) the one-year anniversary of the grant date, (2) the Company's next annual stockholders meeting, or (3) a change in control, and will be settled upon vesting unless the director elects to defer settlement until termination of board service. A pro rata portion of the award vests upon termination of the director's service due to death, disability, or age 75 retirement based on the number of days of service during the year of termination. Equity compensation is prorated for directors who serve less than the full compensation year. Except as described above for terminations due to death, disability, or age 75 retirement, restricted stock units are forfeited on termination of board service before the awards have vested. 
   Cash Compensation  
          Each non-employee director is paid an annual cash retainer for board service of $90,000, payable in installments at each quarterly board meeting. In addition, each non-employee director appointed to serve as a member of a standing board committee receives an annual cash retainer as follows: $12,500 for Audit Committee members; $10,000 for Compensation Committee members; and $7,500 for Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members. Committee chairs are not eligible to receive the committee retainer, but instead receive a committee chair retainer as follows: $25,000 for the Audit Committee chair; $20,000 for the Compensation Committee chair and $15,000 for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chair. Any non-employee board chairman would receive an annual cash retainer of $25,000, and the independent lead director receives an annual cash

retainer of $75,000, in each case, that is in addition to the other cash retainers. Cash fees are prorated for directors who serve less than the full compensation year. 
          Directors may elect to convert their cash fees into Company common stock in the form of deferred stock units. Each deferred stock unit represents the right to receive one share of our common stock. The deferred stock units are fully vested and will be settled upon termination of the director's board service. 
   Travel Expense Reimbursements  
          Directors are reimbursed for their reasonable expenses related to board membership, including first-class airfare on a commercial airline for travel to board meetings or for other Company business. 
   Stock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Period Requirements  
          Our independent directors are expected to own shares of our common stock valued at five times the annual cash board retainer (or $450,000) within five years of their appointment or election to the board, under the terms of the Stock Ownership Guidelines adopted by the Compensation Committee. Directors are required to hold 50% of their vested stock awards until the ownership guidelines are satisfied. Certain directors have elected to defer settlement of their vested restricted stock units and deferred stock units until termination of board service. These deferred vested stock units are deemed owned for purposes of the stock ownership guidelines. Shares assigned by a director to, and that are held by, a significant Company stockholder are deemed owned by the director for purposes of the stock ownership guidelines if the director is a representative or employee of such stockholder and is prohibited from personally holding shares of Company common stock due to the internal policies of such significant stockholder and its associated investment funds. 
          All directors, other than the directors who joined the board during 2017, satisfy the ownership guidelines of five times the annual cash board retainer. 
   Director Orientation and Continuing Education  
          We provide orientation for new directors, and provide our directors with materials or briefing sessions on subjects that we believe will assist them in discharging their duties. We also engage third parties to provide either in-boardroom or dinner meeting education to our directors. To supplement the education we provide, we encourage our directors to attend external programs and reimburse up to $5,000 annually for the costs of attending such programs.

          The Compensation Committee (for purposes of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the "Committee"), pursuant to its charter, is responsible for establishing, implementing, and reviewing on an annual basis our compensation programs and the compensation paid to our NEOs. 
      Executive Summary         
   2018 Executive Compensation Changes  
          During fiscal 2017, the Committee initiated a comprehensive review of the executive compensation program that was led by the Committee's independent consultant with input from executive leadership. In 2017, 97.23% of the say-on-pay votes cast were in favor of our executive compensation program. With input from the Committee's independent consultant, and taking into consideration the Company's say-on-pay vote outcome, the Committee approved the following primary changes for fiscal 2018.

          In addition to the above performance highlights, the Company accomplished significant debt reduction and ongoing interest savings objectives during the year. 
          In addition to an extension of maturities, these transactions reduced our sensitivity to rising interest rates and resulted in interest savings of approximately $14 million annually. 
          The Company supplements its reporting of net income with non-GAAP measurements, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and net debt. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP measurements. Additional information regarding adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and net debt referred to herein, including a reconciliation, if available, to the most comparable GAAP measure, is included under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key business metrics—Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income in our annual report on Form 10-K filed by the Company on March 19, 2019. 
   2018 Executive Compensation and Pay-for-Performance Results  
          The Company's strong financial results and shareholder returns in fiscal 2018 yielded strong payouts and potential values for executives under the Company's short-term and long-term incentive programs, as follows:

      Determining Executive Compensation         
          The Committee oversees and directs our executive compensation process and plan designs. Working under the guidance and direction of the Committee and its independent compensation consultant, our human resources team develops and implements programs that we believe are aligned with the strategies and philosophies embraced by the Committee and our Company. Our finance team heavily supports the process by providing financial analysis and input and review of program design. Except with respect to his own compensation, our CEO has final management-level review of any compensation program before it is sent to the Committee for consideration and approval. The Committee has the task of evaluating and approving our material compensation programs, including our equity compensation program. Management frequently consults with the Committee during the design process to obtain its direction and feedback on how the design of our executive compensation programs support the overall strategy of the Company. As described below, data from outside consultants are also used during the design process to obtain further insight into the features of our compensation program. 
          We consider the cost (including aggregate share usage and dilution) of the various components of our compensation program in evaluating the overall balance and reasonableness of our executives' total direct compensation packages. We review total compensation levels for executive officers at least annually through the use of tally sheets that quantify each element of direct and indirect compensation provided to individual executives and the portion of the executive's total compensation represented by each element of compensation. This annual review of tally sheets also includes information on the value of executives' unexercised stock options and unvested performance awards and outstanding stock awards, as well as an evaluation of the payments and benefits that would be paid to executive officers in the event of termination of employment, including retirement or following a change in control of the Company. The tally sheets provide useful context but do not materially impact executive compensation decisions. 
          Our CEO provides the Committee with a performance assessment for each of the other current NEOs. Our CEO, chief financial officer, chief people officer, and general counsel generally attend

regularly scheduled quarterly Committee meetings, but are not present for the executive sessions or for any discussion of his or her own compensation. The Committee approves the amount and form of each element of compensation (including base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, equity-based incentive compensation, benefits, and perquisites) for the CEO and approves each element of compensation for our other executive officers after considering performance assessments and compensation recommendations made by management. The Committee may not delegate its authority for approval of executive officer compensation. 
          Since 2009, the Committee has engaged Pearl Meyer, a leading executive compensation advisor, to provide input with respect to our executive compensation programs, including a market review of the competitiveness of total compensation of our executives and a review of our equity program. A representative from Pearl Meyer attends our Committee meetings. For further information, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Compensation Consultant and Use of Comparator Data" on page 42. 
      Philosophy and Objectives         
          Our Company and our aspiration to be "First Choice" are built on the mission of "One Team, Driving Customer Success and Value Creation," a philosophy we believe is best embodied by our SPIRIT values: 
          The Committee and our management believe that fostering these values requires a performance culture geared toward customer success and sustainable, long-term profitability. The Company's compensation programs are designed to reward achievement of these goals, thereby attracting and retaining talent that will contribute to such a culture. In particular, our executive compensation programs are intended to meet the following objectives:

          In addition, we intend that our compensation programs will be aligned with: 
      Compensation Consultant and Use of Comparator Data         
          During fiscal 2018, the Company requested and received information from Pearl Meyer with respect to potential conflicts of interest, including the following factors: (1) other services provided to us by the consultant; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm's total revenue; (3) policies and procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a member of the Committee; (5) any Company stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement; (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. Based on an assessment of these factors, including information gathered from directors and executive officers addressing business or personal relationships with the consulting firm or the individual consultants, the Compensation Committee concluded that the work of Pearl Meyer did not raise any conflict of interest. 
          In general, neither the Company nor the Committee has exclusively relied on any of the data or advice received from Pearl Meyer as to the amount of any particular item of compensation. Pearl Meyer provides input which the Company and Committee take into consideration, as the case may be, on the particular element of compensation under consideration. 
          The Committee reviews compensation levels and practices at comparator companies in setting the compensation of our NEOs and when reviewing or establishing the Company's compensation programs for other associates. The information is used to help the Committee better understand the competitive market and how executives are compensated at other companies that are similar in size or industry or with whom we compete for talent. 
          We seek comparators that share a similar industrial distribution model or are a direct competitor to a specific business unit. Companies are, therefore, included in the comparator group because they (1) operate in the same business as the Company or one of our business units (industrial distribution of building supplies), (2) operate in a similar business (distribution of any product), or (3) operate in a similar business model (business to business). The comparator group was developed by Pearl Meyer, with input from management and the Committee, and has been used to provide input into both the

value of total compensation for executives as well as the relative value of each component of compensation. We do not rely on percentile rankings of compensation within the comparator group to determine specific compensation amounts for the NEOs; rather, the comparator group is used to identify programs and levels of pay which management and the Committee consider when evaluating our own programs. 
          For fiscal 2018 compensation decisions, the following comparator group has been used, consisting of companies in the same or similar business or having a similar business model: 
          The Committee conducted a review of the comparator group during fiscal 2018, with input from Pearl Meyer, to ensure that the comparator group continues to remain relevant from an industry and size perspective in light recent acquisition and disposition transactions by the Company. Based on the review, the Committee approved the following comparator group to inform compensation decisions beginning in fiscal 2019. 
          As a secondary market reference, the Committee may also review the compensation levels and practices at local competitors for executive talent, including the following companies, beginning with compensation decisions in fiscal 2019: 
      Components of Compensation         
          The Company believes that the compensation programs it maintains are important in achieving the compensation goals described above. For fiscal 2018, the principal components of compensation for the NEOs were base salary, annual cash incentives, annual equity incentives, and benefits and perquisites. 
          While our NEOs do not have employment agreements with the Company, each of our NEOs is party to an at-will employment offer letter which may contain certain employment arrangements,

including severance payments. Each of our NEOs is also party to a change in control agreement. These arrangements are discussed more fully under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 60-61.

is based on personal performance and contribution, experience in the role, changes to the scope of responsibilities, market rates of pay, and internal equity. The fiscal 2018 salary increases were based on these factors, but were primarily focused on bringing base salary closer to market rates of pay based on comparator group benchmarking for the position. Messrs DeAngelo, Levitt, Stegeman and Stengel did not receive a merit increase for fiscal 2018 based on the market competitiveness of their salary and Company performance.

          Each year, our CEO, with input from human resources, proposes base salary increases, if any, for all NEOs, excluding himself, based on the foregoing factors and the Company's merit increase budget prepared by management. His proposal is subject to review and approval (with or without modifications) by the Committee after consideration of these factors. Our human resources team works directly with the Committee with respect to any changes to Mr. DeAngelo's base salary, and any changes are approved by the Committee, after the board conducts our CEO's annual performance review. Our CEO is not present during voting or deliberations on his compensation. 
          The salary increase is effective for the 12-month period beginning in March of each year; the salary reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54 is base salary earned during the relevant fiscal year. 
   Annual Cash Incentives  
          Annual cash incentives are designed to focus the NEOs on producing superior results against key financial metrics relevant to the Company as a whole or to the individual business unit(s) that the NEO leads. By tying a significant portion of the executive's total annual cash compensation to annual variable pay, we reinforce our "pay for performance" culture and focus our executives on critical short-term financial and operational objectives which also support our long-term financial goals. 
          All of our NEOs participate in the AIP, which provides cash-based incentives dependent on annual results against the key financial metrics described below. AIP target payouts to our NEOs are expressed as a percentage of base salary. Annually, these percentage targets are reviewed against comparator data and adjusted, if necessary, based on the Committee's estimation of what level of targeted payouts is necessary to retain, motivate, and reward our executives. 
          For fiscal 2018, the AIP performance payout weighting was based on an 80% adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization target ("Adjusted EBITDA") and on a 20% average working capital as a percentage of sales target ("AIP-Working Capital"). Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2018 AIP performance payout is Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Company's fiscal 2018 annual report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA referred to herein is included under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations—Key business metrics—Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019. AIP-Working Capital is computed by averaging the gross working capital at the end of each fiscal month divided by the fiscal year sales. Gross working capital was selected to focus on operational working capital and to mitigate any incentive to alter results through adjustments to accruals or reserves. 
          For fiscal 2018, we viewed Adjusted EBITDA as the key operating metric that would drive business profitability. The AIP-Working Capital measure is intended to increase the focus on cash management across the Company, to avoid creating disincentives for investment in growth, and to reward teams for incremental annual improvements in working capital while continuing to grow EBITDA. 
          These results were measured at various levels for each NEO based on their role and responsibilities, as follows:
          The following are the performance and payout scales that were approved by the Committee in March 2018 for the fiscal 2018 annual cash incentives for NEOs, as well as the actual performance results for 2018.

   Annual Equity Incentives  
          Our NEOs participate in the Company's long-term incentive plan, which provides annual equity grants to our NEOs under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan that was approved by our stockholders in May 2017 (the "Omnibus Plan"). The Omnibus Plan is an amendment and restatement of the Company's 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"), which replaced and succeeded the HDS Investment Holding, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan ("Prior Plan") that was adopted by the board shortly following our separation from Home Depot in 2007 (collectively, the Omnibus Plan, 2013 Plan and the Prior Plan are referred to as the "Stock Plan"). Upon adoption of the 2013 Plan, the Prior Plan terminated and no future awards may be made under that plan. However, awards previously granted under the Prior Plan are unaffected by its termination. 
          The Company believes that granting equity awards under the Stock Plan is an effective way to align executive performance to our key goal of increasing value for the Company's stockholders. The view of the Committee is that, assuming that our management is successful in increasing the value of the Company, equity awards under the Stock Plan will have a high potential value for all participants as a percentage of total compensation. The vesting component is intended to maximize the retentive effect of the equity grants. 
          During 2017, the Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, conducted a thorough review of the Company's short-term and long-term incentive plans. Based on this review, the Committee approved a change to the long-term incentive program for 2018 to add performance awards to the annual grant mix for the named executive officers. The grant mix for 2018 is 50% stock options, 25% restricted stock, and 25% performance awards. The Committee believes that adding performance awards to the long-term incentive mix increases the pay-for-performance nature of the long-term incentive program while creating additional focus and accountability for achieving and sustaining long-term adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow growth. 
          The performance award is tied to cumulative adjusted earnings per share (50% of the award) and cumulative free cash flow (50% of the award) over a three-year period (fiscal 2018-fiscal 2020), with a payout opportunity, assuming a threshold level of performance is achieved, of 50% at threshold, 100% at target and 200% maximum, interpolated for performance between threshold/target and target/maximum achievement levels, with new three-year performance period grants made annually. "Cumulative adjusted earnings per share" means the sum of the adjusted net income per diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for each fiscal year during the three-year performance period. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) less income from discontinued operations, net of tax, further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt and certain non-cash, non-recurring, non-operational, or unusual items, net of tax. "Cumulative free cash flow" means the cumulative net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by capital expenditures for the period, as such terms are defined by U.S. GAAP. Additional information regarding free cash flow is included under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity, capital resources and financial condition—External Financing" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019. 
          Performance award shares are granted at the target level of performance. Participants receive payouts in the form of common stock at the end of the performance period in amounts determined by the extent to which the established performance goals were met. The Committee may adjust the performance goals for any performance period as it deems equitable in recognition of unusual or

non-recurring events affecting the Company, changes in applicable tax laws or accounting principles, or such other factors as the Committee may determine. 
          Quantitative performance targets for the awards, and actual performance relative to these targets, will be disclosed after the performance period is completed in January 2021 and actual Company results for the performance period have been fully disclosed. We believe that disclosure of targets relating to future periods could result in substantial competitive harm to the Company since the targets reflect our plans and aspirations to grow our business and may be interpreted as guidance by some investors and provide our competitors significant insight into our internal strategic plans over the next three years. The performance targets are cumulative for the three-year performance period and are not annual targets. The intent is to set targets sufficiently high to provide incentive to achieve a high level of performance. The Committee believes that the targets are appropriate in light of our revenue for prior years, our internal forecast, and the macroeconomic and industry environments at the time of grant. The target-level performance goals can be characterized as requiring strong performance, meaning that although attainment of this performance level is uncertain, it can be reasonably anticipated based on the Company's historical performance that target performance may be achieved, while the threshold target is more likely to be achieved and the maximum target requires more aggressive levels of performance and is less likely to be achieved. Based on Company results for fiscal 2018 and completion of the first year of the performance period, it is management's current expectation that the fiscal 2018 performance awards are on track to pay at or above target. 
          The Committee made an annual equity grant to NEOs in March 2018 in the form of nonqualified stock options (50% of grant value), restricted stock awards (25% of grant value other than for Ms. Stevens), and performance awards (25% of grant value other than for Ms. Stevens). Ms. Stevens received 50% stock options and 50% restricted stock awards at the vice president level before her appointment to an executive officer position in November 2018. The stock option and restricted stock awards vest in four equal annual installments on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. The performance awards vest on the third anniversary of the March 2018 grant date based on achievement of the performance goals. The grants in March 2018 were based on the following percentages of each NEO's 2017 fiscal year end base salary.

          Fifty percent of this amount was divided by the per option Black-Scholes value on the grant date to determine the number of nonqualified stock options granted, 25% (50% for Ms. Stevens) was divided by the per share closing stock price on the grant date to determine the number of restricted shares, and 25% was divided by the per share closing stock price on the grant date to determine the number of performance awards (other than for Ms. Stevens). The percentage of base salary amount and the allocation percentage among stock options, restricted stock and performance awards was determined based on benchmarking data for equity grants and total compensation, using the compensation comparator group set forth on page 43, prorated for time in the position.

benchmarking data serves as a general guideline for managing overall pay decisions relative to market benchmarks, but actual pay decisions may also be based on a subjective assessment of a variety of factors, including experience, individual performance, Company performance, department performance, long-term potential, internal pay equity, tenure, and retention value. 
          The addition of stock options to the annual grant mix in fiscal 2016 and performance awards in fiscal 2018 was intended to significantly enhance the pay-for-performance orientation of the long-term incentive plan and to create even stronger stockholder alignment. This is accomplished by having a component of the annual equity grant that will only deliver value to executives if value is delivered to stockholders through stock price appreciation (stock options), while creating additional focus and accountability for achieving and sustaining long-term adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow growth (performance awards). The Committee will continue to evaluate the long-term incentive plan design each year to ensure alignment with business priorities and market practices, and may approve further changes to the plan design in subsequent years. 
   Benefits and Perquisites  
          The benefits provided to our NEOs are the same as those generally provided to our other salaried associates and include medical, dental and vision insurance, basic life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short and long-term disability insurance, and a 401(k) plan. 
          Our executives participate in a limited number of perquisite programs. We maintain these programs because they are valued by our NEOs but impose relatively little cost to us. Based on market research, the level of benefit provided was generally below the level of benefit provided by industry peers. 
          All of the NEOs participate in the executive basic life insurance plan. Under this plan, the beneficiary of a participant who dies while employed by us is entitled to a lump sum payment of $500,000. The participant owns the insurance policy, and the Company pays the premium on his or her behalf. The value of the premium for fiscal 2018 ranged from $600 to $2,580 and was taxable to the executive. 
          Other benefits provided to our NEOs include use of a company car, the purchase of a company car for less than market value, reimbursement for financial planning services, and, with respect to our CEO, use of a company gym not generally available to other employees. The value of providing company cars and reimbursement for financial planning services is taxable to the executive and is grossed up to avoid reducing the value of the benefits. Each of our NEOs received a financial planning services benefit for fiscal 2018 ranging from $15,000 to $18,000. Our NEOs received a company car benefit for fiscal 2018 ranging from $3,372 to $38,935. Our CEO's use of a company gym was valued at $1,653, which is the average annual membership fee for athletic clubs near the Company's Atlanta headquarters. 
          Because the Company's business continuity is best facilitated by avoiding any prolonged or unexpected absences by members of its senior management team, all NEOs are strongly encouraged to take advantage of comprehensive executive physical examinations paid for by the Company. The value of executive physical examinations for our NEOs for fiscal 2018 ranged from $2,675 to $3,161.

[END TABLE]
          At the end of the year, each participant receives an additional payment equal to the gross amount of taxes paid on the life insurance, financial planning and car benefits. This additional payment is also taxable to the executive and is grossed up. The tax gross-ups received by our NEOs for fiscal 2018 ranged from $16,448 to $44,839. 
          Other personal benefits provided were passport renewal fee required for business purposes that had a potential personal benefit; air travel and meals for spouses to attend a Company business event; and travel costs that had both a business and personal benefit. The value of other personal benefits ranged from $439 to $4,946. 
          For the amount of perquisites and other personal benefits for each executive, please refer to the All Other Compensation table on page 55. 
   Change in Control Agreements  
          To focus management on acting in the best interests of our stockholders in a change in control context, consistent with peer benchmarking with respect to executive level change in control agreements, the Committee approved agreements for our executive officers that generally provide for a lump sum cash payment to the executive equal to two times the executive's base salary and target bonus opportunity and $100,000 in lieu of continued healthcare and other benefits. Payout is triggered on an involuntary or constructive termination of the executive's employment within two years of a change in control, other than a termination for death, disability, or cause (as defined in the agreement). We believe that providing this protection to our senior executives aids retention and minimizes any disincentive to pursue a transaction that would be good for our stockholders but potentially bad for individual executives due to job loss. Benefits are predicated upon a "double trigger" (consummation of a change in control and qualifying employment termination) and no excise tax gross-ups are provided to the executives, thereby protecting the interests of our stockholders. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 61 for a summary of the material provisions of these agreements. 
      Other Policies and Practices         
   Risk Assessment  
          During fiscal 2018, management and the Committee conducted a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the potential risks associated with our compensation policies and practices with respect to both executive compensation and compensation generally. Based on our approach of compensating our associates for the financial success of the Company as a whole and other elements of our compensation system, we concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage undue risk-taking and do not create any risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. See page 27 for additional details. 
   Policy on Recovering Incentive Compensation in the Event of a Restatement  
          The board adopted a clawback policy that provides us with the ability to require reimbursement or cancellation of any bonus or other incentive-based compensation, including stock-based compensation, awarded or paid to any current or former executive officer of the Company during the three-year period prior to a restatement if the incentive compensation was predicated upon the

achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of restatement, the executive officer engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that was a substantial contributing cause to the need for the restatement, and a lower award would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results. The policy applies to incentive compensation awarded, vesting, or paid to an executive officer after the 2013 effective date of the policy. The policy is in addition to the requirements of applicable law and other legal remedies available to the Company. 
   Stock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Period Requirements  
          Pursuant to our stock ownership guidelines, our NEOs are required to own shares of our common stock having a value equal to a specific multiple of the NEO's base salary. Those multiples are, for our CEO (Mr. DeAngelo): five times; for our Chief Financial Officer and business unit leaders (Mr. Levitt and Mr. Stegeman): three times; and for our functional leaders (Mr. McDevitt and Ms. Stevens): one times. These ownership levels must be achieved within the later of five years from the 2013 effective date of the policy or the date he or she becomes an executive officer. Our NEOs must hold 50% of vested shares (except for shares withheld or sold to pay required tax withholding and the exercise price for options) until they are in compliance with the guidelines. Our stock ownership guidelines count the following types of ownership: shares owned outright; shares owned directly by a spouse, domestic partner, or minor child; shares owned indirectly through beneficial trust ownership; vested shares or vested stock units held in any Company plan; and the in-the-money value of vested stock option awards. Compliance is evaluated annually by the Committee as of the end of each fiscal year, using a thirty-day closing stock price average to mitigate the impact of short-term price variations. The guidelines further our core philosophy that our NEOs should also be owners of our Company. The guidelines are based on our expectation that each NEO will maintain a targeted level of investment in our stock so that the interests of our NEOs and our stockholders are closely aligned, and our NEOs have a strong incentive to provide effective management. All of our NEOs satisfied the targeted ownership guidelines as of the end of fiscal 2018 other than Ms. Stevens, who has five years from her November 2018 executive officer appointment to achieve compliance with the guidelines. 
   Policy Regarding Certain Transactions in Company Securities  
          Through our Policy for Trading in Company Securities, we prohibit our directors, officers and employees from engaging in the following types of transactions in Company securities: 
           Short Sales.    Short sales evidence an expectation that the stock value will decline and signals to the market an absence of confidence in a company's short-term prospects. In addition, short sales may reduce the seller's incentive to improve company performance. For these reasons, we prohibit our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in short sales of the Company's securities. Moreover, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act generally prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. 
          Publicly Traded Options.    A transaction in publicly traded options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of a stock and may create the appearance of trading based on inside information. Transactions in options may also focus a person on short-term performance at the expense of a company's long-term objectives. Accordingly, we prohibit transactions in puts, calls, or other derivative securities with respect to Company securities. 
           Hedging Transactions.    Hedging and monetization transactions allow a person to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ​   ​   ​  
 ​    ​         ​ ​  ​ ​

[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued)   
[END TABLE]
appreciation in the stock. Hedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible mechanisms, including, but not limited to, through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, puts, calls, collars, forwards and other derivative instruments, or through the establishment of a short position in a company's securities. These transactions allow the person to continue to own the security, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the person may no longer have the same objectives as a company's other stockholders. We, therefore, prohibit our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in transactions that are designed to, or that may reasonably be expected to, have the effect of hedging or offsetting a decrease in the market value of Company securities. 
           Pledging.    Securities held in a margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the customer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged or hypothecated as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. A margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in a company's securities pursuant to a blackout period restriction. We, therefore, prohibit our directors, officers and employees from purchasing or borrowing against Company securities on margin, holding Company securities in a margin account, or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. 
   Deductibility of Compensation  
          Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to certain "covered employees." Beginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m), making previously deductible performance-based compensation now subject to the $1 million limit. In making its compensation decisions, the Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m), along with other relevant factors (see foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis discussion), and provides compensation that it believes is consistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such compensation may not be tax deductible.

           RATIO OF CEO TO MEDIAN EMPLOYEE TOTAL COMPENSATION: 146:1   
[END TABLE]
          Our CEO's annual total compensation is 146 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all our U.S. employees. The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
          There has been no change in either our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure for 2018. We had a 10% net increase in our employee population over last year due to normal hiring and attrition, with 20% of the addition being employees acquired through the acquisition of A.H. Harris in March 2018. The compensation of the hired employees were evenly distributed around the median compensation determined last year (48% below the median and 52% above the median, with a net 2.6% increase in the median compensation). We, therefore, used the same median employee in our pay ratio calculation for 2018 as was determined for the previous year using the methodologies disclosed in our proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 30, 2018. 
          The compensation reported for our chief executive officer is fiscal 2018 compensation from the Summary Compensation Table on page 54 of this proxy statement. The compensation reported for the median employee is fiscal 2018 compensation from our internal payroll records. The All Other Compensation column for the median employee represents a 401(k) plan company matching contribution.

          Equity-based awards granted to our executive officers are determined based on the intended dollar value to be delivered to provide market competitive grants. The grants in March 2018 to our NEOs other than Ms. Stevens were in the form of nonqualified stock options (50% of grant value) and restricted stock awards (25% of grant value) that vest in four equal annual installments on each of the

first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and performance awards (25% of grant value) that vest at the end of a three-year performance period if the applicable earnings per share and free cash flow performance criteria are achieved. Ms. Stevens' March 2018 award was in the form of nonqualified stock options (50% of grant value) and restricted stock awards (50% of grant value) at the vice president level before her promotion to an executive officer position in November 2018. Her awards vest on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date. 
          A discussion of each type of equity award made in fiscal 2018, including a discussion of the performance criteria for the performance-based awards, can be found under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Components of Compensation — Annual Equity Incentives" beginning on page 48. 
          The March 2018 grants were based on the following percentages of each NEO's fiscal 2017 base salary.

          Fifty percent of this amount was then divided by the per option Black-Scholes value on the grant date to determine the number of nonqualified stock options granted, and 25% of this amount was then divided by the per share closing stock price on the grant date to determine the number each of restricted share and performance awards granted (other than for Ms. Stevens who was not an executive officer on March 8, 2018 and thus did not receive a performance award). The percentage of base salary amount and the allocation percentage between restricted stock, stock options, and performance awards was determined based on benchmarking data for equity grants and total compensation, using the compensation comparator group set forth on page 43, and prorated for time in the position. The benchmarking data serves as a general guideline for managing overall pay decisions relative to market benchmarks, with actual pay decisions also based on experience, performance, long-term potential, internal pay equity, tenure, and retention value. 
          The Stock Plan and award agreement governs each award and provide, among other things, the vesting provisions of the award. The holder of a restricted stock award has rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to such award, including voting rights and the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. The Company does not currently pay dividends on its common stock. 
          See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on pages 60-64 for information regarding the cancellation or acceleration of vesting of the equity awards upon an option holder's termination of employment or a change in control of the Company. 
   Employment Offer Letters and Change in Control Agreements  
          While our NEOs do not have employment agreements with the Company, each of our NEOs, other than Mr. Stengel who separated employment with the Company in October 2018, is party to an at-will employment offer letter which may contain certain employment arrangements, including

          The employment offer letters do not provide for any payout upon termination as a result of death, retirement, disability, or termination for cause. 
   Change in Control Agreements  
          Each of our NEOs is party to a change in control agreement with the Company. The agreement provides for an initial three-year term that will automatically renew on an annual basis following the initial term unless either party gives advance notice of termination in accordance with the agreement. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the Stock Plan), the agreement would generally expire no earlier than the second anniversary of such change in control. Contingent upon the executive's execution of a release of claims against the Company, the agreement provides for a lump sum cash payment to the executive equal to two times the executive's base salary and target bonus opportunity and $100,000 in lieu of continued healthcare and other benefits. Payout is triggered on an involuntary or constructive termination (as defined in the agreement) of the executive's employment within two years of a change in control, other than a termination for death, disability, or cause (as defined in the agreement). Payout is also triggered on termination of the executive's employment without cause before a change in control at the direction or request of a person or group contemplating a change in control and a change in control involving such person or group occurs within 12 months of such direction or request. In such event, the agreement also provides for a lump sum cash payment to the executive equal to the intrinsic value of any forfeited equity awards that would have vested had the executive's employment continued through the time immediately following the change in control (subject to certain limitations described in the agreement). The payments described in this paragraph are in lieu of any other severance or salary continuation obligation the Company may have to the executive, but generally do not impact benefits paid under other Company plans. In consideration for the compensation provided by the agreement, the executive agrees to comply with customary non-competition and employee customer and vendor non-solicitation restrictive covenants for 24 months after termination, as well as certain customary confidentiality provisions. The Company is responsible for the executive's reasonable attorney fees and costs in defending or prosecuting certain disputes regarding the agreement. 
          Pursuant to their change in control agreements, assuming an involuntary or constructive termination as of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019, and contingent upon execution of a release, non-competition and non-solicitation agreement, each of our NEOs would have received the following compensation:

   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (continued)   
[END TABLE]
   Stock Plan  
          Under the Stock Plan, an executive's unvested stock options are cancelled upon termination of his or her employment, except for terminations due to death or disability. Upon death or disability, unvested stock options vest and remain exercisable. In the case of a termination for cause (as defined in the Stock Plan), the executive's unvested and vested stock options are cancelled as of the effective date of the termination. Following a termination of employment other than for cause, vested options are cancelled unless the executive exercises them within 90 days (for options granted before November 19, 2015, 180 days if the termination was due to death, disability or retirement; for options granted on and after November 19, 2015, two years on termination due to death, disability or retirement and two years from vesting for options that continue to vest after retirement) or, if sooner, prior to the options' normal expiration date). Equity awards granted under the Omnibus Stock Plan may provide for continued vesting of the award in the event of retirement at or after age 62 with at least five years of continuous service with the Company, contingent upon the executive: (i) not competing with the Company and its subsidiaries for the one-year period after retirement; and (ii) not engaging in activities that would constitute cause had the executive continued employment with the Company. For options granted before November 19, 2015, the executive has 180 days to exercise options vested at the time of such retirement and 90 days to exercise options vesting after such retirement. For options granted on and after November 19, 2015, the executive has two years to exercise options vested at the time of such retirement and two years to exercise options vesting after such retirement. None of our NEOs satisfied the retirement criteria at the end of fiscal 2018. 
          Had a termination of employment without cause occurred at the end of fiscal 2018, other than a termination due to death, disability or retirement, based on the closing price of our common stock of $41.95 at the end of fiscal 2018, our NEOs would have received a benefit, assuming the hypothetical exercise of vested stock options on the last day of fiscal 2018, and forfeited unvested stock options and stock awards, in the following amounts.

          Under the Stock Plan, upon a change in control of the Company, all outstanding awards may be assumed and/or replaced with substitute awards having the same or better terms and conditions, provided that any substitute awards under the Omnibus Plan must fully vest (performance awards vest at the target level) on a participant's involuntary termination of employment without cause or constructive termination of employment, in each case occurring within two years following the date of the change in control. In the event such awards are not assumed and/or replaced in connection with the change in control, the awards will vest and be cancelled for the same per share amount paid to the stockholders in the change in control (less, in the case of options and stock appreciation rights, the applicable exercise or base price). The Committee has the ability to prescribe different treatment of awards in the award agreements. We believe this structure is fair to both our associates and to our stockholders, as the awards may represent compensation for the loss of an executive's job after a significant career with the Company and for the appreciation of stock granted many years before. Had a change in control occurred at the end of fiscal 2018 and the awards were not assumed or replaced with new rights with similar terms, based on the closing price of our common stock of $41.95 at the

          For additional biographical information about the nominees for director, including information about their qualifications to serve as a director, see "Our Board of Directors" beginning on page 17. 
          A nominee must receive the vote of a plurality of the votes validly cast at the Annual Meeting represented either in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting to be elected. Therefore, the six nominees who receive the most "FOR" votes (among votes properly cast in person, electronically or by proxy) will be elected. Notwithstanding such election, each of the six nominees for election to the board has agreed to tender to the board his or her resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results in the event such nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" his or her election (see "Majority Voting Policy – Director Nominees" on page 5 for details regarding the board's majority voting policy). 
          At the 2018 annual meeting, our stockholders approved a proposal to declassify our board and elected our Class II directors to serve a term that expires at the Annual Meeting. Since the declassification did not shorten the existing terms of our directors, at the Annual Meeting, the directors elected at the 2018 annual meeting and the Class III directors whose term expires at Annual Meeting, will stand for election for terms of one year (a term that expires at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders) and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. At the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020, the board will cease to be classified and all directors will be elected to serve terms expiring upon the next annual meeting of stockholders following their election and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. 
          There are no agreements or arrangements between third parties and any of the nominees that provide for compensation or other payment in connection with the director's candidacy or service as a director. There are no family relationships between any director, executive officer, or director nominee. 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT  STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION TO THE BOARD  OF EACH OF THE SIX NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR.

   PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

          PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audited our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019. Upon the recommendation of our Audit Committee, the board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2020 and to prepare a report on this audit, subject to ratification by our stockholders. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2008. 
          This proposal asks you to ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although we are not required to obtain such ratification from our stockholders, the board believes that it is good practice to do so. If the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not ratified, the Audit Committee and the board may reconsider the appointment. 
          A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by stockholders.

   PROPOSAL 3 — APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN    
[END TABLE]
          We are seeking your vote to approve the HD Supply Holdings, Inc. Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to in this proposal as the "plan." Upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (referred to in this proposal as the "Committee"), the plan was approved and adopted by our board of directors on March 7, 2019. If approved by our stockholders, the plan will become effective on the first day of the first offering period beginning after the Annual Meeting. If our stockholders do not approve the plan, it will not become effective. The plan authorizes an additional 709,674 shares, plus the 1,490,326 remaining authorized shares as of the record date, for a total of 2.2 million shares. 
      Summary of the Proposal         
          The primary purpose of the plan is to encourage ownership of our common stock by eligible employees of HD Supply and its controlled subsidiaries and partnerships. Specifically, the plan provides eligible employees an opportunity to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of our common stock on periodic purchase dates at a discount. The board believes that the plan is a valued benefit for our eligible employee base. We believe that allowing employees to purchase shares of our common stock through the plan motivates high levels of performance and provides an effective means of encouraging employee commitment to our success and aids in recruiting new employees. 
      Summary of Material Terms of the Plan         
          The following summary of the plan is qualified in its entirety by the specific language of the plan, a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. 
   General  
          The plan is a nonqualified plan, meaning that is not intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The tax law governing Section 423 plans limits participation to employees of corporate subsidiaries, and does not permit participation by employees of partnerships. Because HD Supply has partnership employees in our controlled group who are eligible to participate in the plan, we cannot maintain a tax-qualified plan under Code Section 423. The plan is not subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, nor is it qualified under Code Section 401(a). 
   Requested Share Authorization  
          The maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for sale under the plan is 2,200,000, which includes the 1,490,326 shares remaining available under the plan as of the record date. Shares issued under the plan may be authorized but unissued shares, shares held in treasury, or shares that have been reacquired by the Company. We anticipate that the requested shares should provide us with the ability to grant share purchase rights for approximately five years. 
   Administration  
          The Committee is the plan administrator. The Committee has authority to delegate its powers, duties, and responsibilities to Company officers or other employees, provided that only the Committee

has the power to determine the purchase price, set a maximum number of shares that may be purchased for any offering period, or take any other action required by Delaware law to be taken by the board. Subject to such restrictions and any subsequent change of delegation by the Committee, the Committee has delegated plan administration to the Company's Chief Administrative Officer and Chief People Officer. 
          The Committee may prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the administration of the plan and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration and interpretation of the plan. Any authority exercised by the Committee under the plan shall be exercised by the Committee in its sole discretion. Determinations, interpretations, or other actions made or taken by the Committee under the plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons. 
   Eligibility  
          Employees eligible to participate in the plan for a given offering period are those individuals who are classified as employees on the payroll records of the Company or a designated subsidiary and who are employed on the first day of the offering period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, on a prospective basis, exclude from participation in the plan, employees (i) whose customary employment is for not more than 20 hours per week or five months per year, (ii) who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, (iii) who are classified as temporary employees on the payroll records of the Company or a designated subsidiary, (iv) who are on an unpaid leave of absence, (v) who are highly compensated employees within the meaning of Code Section 414(q), or (vi) who are employees subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Employees who own (or are deemed to own through attribution) 5% or more of the combined voting power or value of all our classes of stock or of one of our subsidiaries are not allowed to participate. The Committee may on a prospective basis impose a generally applicable eligibility service requirement of up to two years of employment. 
          As of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2019, we had approximately 11,830 employees eligible to participate in the plan. 
   Equal Rights and Privileges  
          All participants have equal rights and privileges under the plan. 
   Payroll Deductions  
          Eligible employees may enroll under the plan by completing a payroll deduction authorization permitting the deduction of not more than 15% of their compensation, capped at $12,500 for any offering period. Eligible compensation includes base compensation plus commissions, military, parental leave and overtime pay before deduction for pre-tax contributions to any cafeteria or tax-qualified retirement plan. The Committee has the authority to change the components of eligible compensation and the contribution limitations for any subsequent offering period. The accumulated payroll deductions are applied to the purchase of shares on each semi-annual purchase date.

   Offering Period and Purchase of Shares  
          Under the plan, participants have the ability to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount during a series of successive offering periods, which will commence and end on such dates as determined by the administrator. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, each offering period will be six months in length. 
          Unless otherwise determined by the Committee before the beginning of any offering period, the purchase price shall be 85% of the closing stock price per share of our common stock on the last day of the offering period (the "purchase date") or the immediately preceding trading day if Nasdaq is closed for trades on such date. The purchase price determined by the Committee may not be less than this amount. 
          Unless a participant has previously cancelled his or her participation in the plan before the purchase date, the participant is deemed to have exercised his or her ability to purchase shares of our common stock in full as of each purchase date. Upon exercise, the participant purchases the number of whole shares that his or her accumulated payroll deductions will buy at the purchase price per share of our common stock on the last day of the offering period or on the immediately preceding trading date if Nasdaq is closed for trades on such date, subject to the participation limitations listed above and shares available under the plan. 
          A participant may withdraw from participation by cancelling his or her payroll deduction authorization before such date established by the administrator prior to the end of the offering period. Upon cancellation, a participant will be paid his or her account balance in cash without interest. A participant who withdraws from participation must re-enroll if he or she wishes to participate for any subsequent offering period. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator, a participant may only increase or decrease the rate of payroll withholding effective for the next offering period by submitting a new authorization before the offering period for which such change is to be effective; otherwise, a participant will automatically participate in the next offering period at the same rate of payroll withholding as in effect at the end of the prior offering period provided that the participant remains eligible to participate in the plan. 
   Non-Transferability and Restrictions on Resale  
          A participant may not assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution) payroll deductions credited to a participant's account or any rights to purchase shares of our common stock or to receive shares of our common stock under the plan, and during a participant's lifetime, rights to purchase shares of our common stock in the plan shall be exercisable only by such participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge, or other disposition will not be given effect. The administrator may, in its sole discretion, place additional restrictions on the sale or transfer of our shares purchased under the plan by notice to the participants in advance of the offering period. 
   Termination of Eligibility  
          If an individual's eligibility to participate in the plan terminates for any reason before the last day of the offering period, the termination will cause payroll deductions to cease immediately. If the

eligible employee's subscription account has a cash balance remaining when he or she terminates, this balance will be refunded to the eligible employee in cash (without interest) as soon as practicable. 
   Change in Control or Occurrence of Significant Corporate Transactions  
          In the event of a change in control as defined in the plan, the administrator may take such action it deems necessary or appropriate, including, but not limited to. shortening any offering period then in progress and refunding amounts accumulated in participant accounts, cancelling outstanding share purchase rights as of the change in control date and paying each holder an amount equal to the difference between the per share fair market value as of the change in control date and the plan's discounted purchase price, or, for each outstanding share purchase right, granting a substitute right to purchase shares in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A, if applicable. 
          In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering, extraordinary dividend, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, or other equity restructuring, the administrator in its sole discretion and in good faith to prevent dilution or enlargement of participant rights, shall make equitable adjustments in the number and type of shares or other property covered by outstanding purchase rights, the purchase price, the kind of shares covered, including shares of another issuer, and adjustment to the limitations on the maximum number and kind of shares that may be issued under the plan. In the event of any merger, consolidation, or any other corporate transaction or event having a similar effect that is not an equity restructuring, the administrator may also provide in substitution for any or all outstanding share repurchase rights such alternative consideration as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection with such alternative consideration the surrender of all share repurchase rights so replaced. 
   Federal Income Tax Consequences  
          The following is a brief summary of the federal income tax consequences relating to the purchase and sale of stock under the plan for individuals who are both citizens and residents of the United States. Individual circumstances may change these results. This brief discussion is based on current U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, and judicial and administrative interpretations. The following discussion does not set forth any tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences, including any state, local, or foreign tax consequences that may apply.
          Contributions to the plan are made on an after-tax basis and are not tax deductible. The amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date and the purchase price will be treated as ordinary compensation income at the time of such purchase and subject to income and employment tax withholding. The amount of such ordinary income will be added to the participant's tax basis in the shares, and any additional gain or resulting loss recognized on the disposition of the shares after such basis adjustment will be a capital gain or loss. A capital gain or loss will be long-term if the participant holds the shares for more than one year after the purchase date. 
          An additional 3.8% Medicare tax may be imposed on ordinary dividend and capital gains related to holding or disposition of shares if the participant's gross income exceeds a certain threshold. The participant is responsible for the reporting and payment of any income tax incurred in connection with a subsequent sale. In addition, the participant is responsible for reporting as income the amount of dividends, if any, paid on shares held in the participant's name.

          The Company is generally entitled to a tax deduction in the year of purchase equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
   New Plan Benefits  
          The amounts of future purchases under the plan are not determinable because participation is voluntary, participation levels depend on each participant's elections, and the per-share purchase price depends on the future value of our common stock. Further, as of the date of this proxy statement, no employee has been granted the right to purchase shares under the proposed plan. Accordingly, the benefits to be received pursuant to the plan by our employees are not determinable at this time. 
   Plan Term  
          The plan will terminate on the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the effective date, termination of the plan by the board or the Committee, or when no more shares are available for issuance under the plan. Upon termination of the Plan, all funds accumulated in a participant accounts will be refunded to participants, without interest. and all share repurchase rights shall automatically terminate. 
   Amendment and Termination of the Plan  
          Our board or the Committee may amend, suspend, or terminate the plan at any time, provided that the plan may not be materially modified in any way that would require stockholder approval under applicable law. 
   Limitation Period For Claims  
          Any person who believes he or she is being denied any benefit or right under the plan may file a written notice with the Committee. Any claim must be delivered to the Committee within forty-five (45) days of the later of the date of purchase of shares or the specific event giving rise to the claim. Untimely claims will not be processed and shall be deemed denied. The Committee will notify the participant of its decision in writing as soon as administratively practicable. Claims not responded to by the Committee in writing within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the date the written claim is delivered to the Committee shall be deemed denied. The Committee's decision is final and conclusive and binding on all persons. No lawsuit relating to the Plan may be filed before a written claim is filed with the Committee and is denied or deemed denied, and any lawsuit must be filed within one year of such denial or deemed denial or forever be barred. 
   Venue and Governing Law  
          To the extent not preempted by federal law, the plan is construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the application of rules of conflict of law that would apply the laws of any other jurisdiction. Claims and disputes of any kind arising out of or relating to the plan may only be brought in the Delaware Chancery Court. By participating in the plan, the participant and persons or entities claiming through the participant waive any objection to the foregoing choice of venue and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court in any such claim or dispute. In the event that the Delaware Chancery Court determines that it cannot or will not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute, then the Superior Court of

Cobb County, State of Georgia, shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any such claim or dispute. 
   Board Recommendation  
          The board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to obtain stockholder approval of the plan. We believe that allowing employees to purchase shares of our common stock through the plan motivates high levels of performance and provides an effective means of encouraging employee commitment to our success and aids in recruiting new employees. 
          Approval of the plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast. Abstentions have the effect of being counted as a vote "AGAINST" the plan. Broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast, so they do not have an effect on the vote. If we receive stockholder approval, the plan will go into effect on the first day of the first offering period beginning after the Annual Meeting. If we do not receive stockholder approval, the plan will not go into effect. 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT  STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF OUR  AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

To our knowledge, each of our directors and executive officers complied during fiscal 2018 with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements.

In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, spinoff, rights offering, extraordinary dividend, combination or exchange of Shares, recapitalization or other change in the capital structure of the Company constituting an "equity restructuring" within the meaning of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718"), the Administrator shall make or provide for equitable adjustments in (i) the number and type of Shares or other securities or property covered by outstanding Share Purchase Rights, (ii) the Purchase Price specified therein, (iii) the kind of Shares covered thereby (including shares of another issuer); and (iv) adjustment to the limitations in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the Plan.

In the event of any merger, consolidation, or any other corporate transaction or event having a similar effect that is not an "equity restructuring" with the meaning of FASB ASC Topic 718, the Administrator in its sole discretion may, in addition to the actions permitted to be taken in respect of an equity restructuring, provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Share Purchase Rights under this Plan such alternative consideration as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection with such alternative consideration the surrender of all Share Purchase Rights so replaced. After any adjustment made by the 
Page 4 of 12
Table of Contents
Administrator pursuant to this Section 3.2, the number of shares subject to each outstanding Share Purchase Right shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be effected in compliance with Code Section 409A to the extent applicable. All determinations and adjustments made by the Administrator in good faith pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be final and binding on the affected Participants and the Company. 
         (b)    Change in Control.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, in the event of a Change in Control, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may take whatever action it deems necessary or appropriate in connection therewith, including, but not limited to (i) shortening any Offering Period then in progress and refunding any amounts accumulated in a Participant's account for such Offering Period, (ii) cancelling all outstanding Share Purchase Rights as of the Change in Control date and paying each holder thereof an amount equal to the difference between the per Share Fair Market Value as of the Change in Control date and the Purchase Price determined in accordance with Section 6.3, or (iii) for each outstanding Share Purchase Right, granting a substitute right to purchase shares (in a manner consistent with Code Section 409A to the extent applicable). Nothing in this Section 3.2(b) shall affect in any way the Board or Committee's right to terminate the Plan at any time pursuant to Section 10.7 or 10.8. 
         (c)    Insufficient Shares.    If the Administrator determines that, on a given Acquisition Date, the number of Shares that may be purchased under the outstanding Share Purchase Rights for the applicable Offering Period may exceed (i) the number of Shares that were available for issuance under the Plan on the Offer Date of the applicable Offering Period or (ii) the number of Shares available for sale under the Plan on such Acquisition Date, including but not limited to by reason of a limitation on the maximum number of Shares that may be purchased set by the Committee pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or (b), the Administrator shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares available for issuance on such Acquisition Date in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all Participants purchasing Shares on such Acquisition Date, and unless additional Shares are authorized for issuance under the Plan, no further Offering Periods shall take place and the Plan shall terminate pursuant to Section 10.7 hereof. If the Plan is so terminated, then the balance of the amount credited to the Participant's account which has not been applied to the purchase of Shares shall be paid to such Participant in one lump sum in cash as soon as reasonably practicable without any interest thereon. The Company may make a pro rata allocation of the Shares available on the Offer Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant to the first sentence of this section, notwithstanding any authorization of additional Shares for issuance under the Plan by the Company's stockholders subsequent to such Offer Date. 
  ARTICLE IV         ELIGIBILITY 
         Section 4.1    Eligible Employees.    Any person who is an Employee of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary as of the Offer Date for a given Offering Period shall be eligible to participate in the Plan for such Offering Period, subject to the requirements of this Article IV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, on a prospective basis, (i) exclude from 
Page 5 of 12
Table of Contents participation in the Plan, Employees (a) whose customary employment is for not more than 20 hours per week or five months per year, (b) who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, (c) who are classified as temporary Employees on the payroll records of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, (d) who are on an unpaid leave of absence, (e) who are highly compensated employees within the meaning of Code Section 414(q), or (f) who are Employees subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, and (ii) impose a generally applicable eligibility service requirement of up to two years of employment. 
         Section 4.2    Five Percent Stockholders.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Employee may participate in the Plan if such Employee, immediately after an option is granted under the Plan, owns, or would own, stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of its parent or subsidiary corporations as contemplated by Code Section 423. The rules of Code Section 424 shall apply in determining stock ownership and parent and subsidiary corporations. The stock which the Employee may purchase under outstanding options shall be treated as stock owned by the Employee. 
         Section 4.3    Participants Who Become Ineligible.    With respect to a Participant who becomes ineligible to participate in the Plan during an Offering Period other than due to employment termination, Contributions that have accumulated in the Participant's account shall be used to purchase Common Stock on the Acquisition Date unless such Participant elects to withdraw in accordance with Article IX. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, in the event an Employee who again satisfies the eligibility conditions and has not withdrawn, payroll deductions shall resume automatically in accordance with his or her most recent payroll deduction authorization form in effect prior to becoming ineligible. 
  ARTICLE V         PARTICIPATION 
         Section 5.1    Enrollment Procedures.    An eligible Employee may become a Participant in the Plan by completing a payroll deduction authorization form and any other required enrollment documents provided by the Administrator or its designee and submitting them to the Administrator or its designee in accordance with the rules established by the Administrator. The enrollment documents, which may be in electronic form, shall set forth the portion of the Participant's Compensation, in accordance with Section 6.2(a), including any minimum Contribution amount and any minimum Contribution increments, to be paid as Contributions pursuant to the Plan. An Employee's payroll deduction authorization shall become effective on the Offer Date. Amounts deducted from a Participant's Compensation pursuant to this Article V shall be credited to the Participant's Plan account. No interest shall be payable on the amounts credited to the Participant's Plan account. 
         Section 5.2    Changes to Enrollment.    A Participant's election to participate in the Plan with respect to an Offering Period shall enroll such Participant in the Plan for each successive Offering period at the same payroll deduction election as in effect at the termination of the prior Offering Period, unless (i) such Participant delivers to the Company a different election with respect to the successive Offering Period by such time and in such manner as is designated by the Administrator for enrollment in the Plan for such successive Offering

Period, (ii) such Participant withdraws from the Plan pursuant to Article IX or becomes ineligible for participation in the Plan or (iii) the Administrator determines that elections for all Participants shall cease at the end of an applicable Offering Period. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, a Participant may not increase or decrease the rate of payroll deductions during an Offering Period. 
         Section 5.3    Equal Rights and Privileges.    Each Employee who is granted a Share Purchase Right under the Plan for any Offering Period shall have the same rights and privileges as all other Employees granted Share Purchase Rights under the Plan for such Offering Period. 
  ARTICLE VI         SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS 
         Section 6.1    Number of Shares.    Each eligible Employee who on the Offer Date is a Participant in such Offering Period shall be granted a Share Purchase Right to purchase Shares on the Acquisition Date for such Offering Period. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.2, the number of Shares subject to such Share Purchase Right shall be the number of whole Shares determined by dividing the Purchase Price into the balance credited to the Participant's account as of the Acquisition less any tax withholding amount deducted pursuant to Section 10.3. 
         Section 6.2    Limitation on Purchases.    Participant purchases are subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.2(c) and to the following limitations: 
         (a)    Offering Period Limitation.    The maximum aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares that a Participant shall have the right to purchase in any Offering Period pursuant to a Share Purchase Right shall be equal to the lesser of 15% of the Participant's Compensation earned during such Offering Period or $12,500, or such other percentage or fixed dollar amount as the Committee shall determine. The Committee may also set a maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be purchased pursuant to Share Purchase Rights with respect to any Offering Period or on any Acquisition Date. 
         (b)    Refunds.    As of the first date on which a Participant's ability to purchase Shares is limited by this Section 6.2, the Participant's payroll deductions shall terminate, and any excess payroll deductions credited to his or her account shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable without any interest thereon. 
         Section 6.3    Purchase Price.    The purchase price per Share with respect to an Offering Period shall be equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which an Offering Period ends; provided, however, that the Committee may determine a different per share Purchase Price provided that: (i) such per share Purchase Price is communicated to Participants before the beginning of the Offering Period, and (ii) in no event shall such per share Purchase Price be less than 85% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date on which an Offering Period ends.

Article VII  PURCHASE OF SHARES UNDER SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS 
         Section 7.1    Purchase.    Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Article IX, each Participant shall automatically purchase and acquire as of the Acquisition Date the number of whole Shares subject to the Share Purchase Right that may be purchased at the Purchase Price for that Share Purchase Right with the Contributions in such Participant's account. Any surplus in the account that is insufficient to purchase a whole Share shall be carried forward into the next Offering Period unless the Participant has elected to withdraw from the Plan pursuant to Article IX or the Administrator determines that surplus amounts for Participants shall not be carried forward, in which case such surplus amount shall be distributed to the Participant in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable without any interest thereon. 
         Section 7.2    Registration Compliance.    
         (a)  No Shares may be purchased under a Share Purchase Right unless the Shares to be issued or transferred upon purchase are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act or are eligible for an exemption from the registration requirements, and the Plan is in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, foreign and other securities and other laws applicable to the Plan. 
         (b)  If, on an Acquisition Date of any Offering Period, the Shares are not registered or exempt or the Plan is not in such compliance, no Shares under the Share Purchase Rights granted under the Plan shall be purchased on the Acquisition Date. The Acquisition Date shall be delayed until the Shares are subject to such an effective registration statement or exempt, and the Plan is in such compliance. The Acquisition Date shall in no event be more than five years from the Offer Date. 
         (c)  If, on the Acquisition Date of any Offering Period, as delayed to the maximum extent permissible, the Shares are not registered or exempt and the Plan is not in such compliance, no Shares under the Share Purchase Rights shall be purchased, and all Contributions accumulated during the Offering Period (reduced to the extent, if any, such deductions have been used to acquire Shares) shall be distributed to the Participants in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable without any interest thereon. 
         Section 7.3    Delivery of Shares.    As soon as practicable after each Acquisition Date, the Company shall deliver the Shares acquired by each Participant during an Offering Period to the Participant or an account established in the Participant's name at a stock brokerage or other financial services firm designated by the Company. The Shares purchased by each Participant shall be issued in book entry form; no certificates shall be delivered with respect to the Shares acquired by a Participant. 
         Section 7.4    Vesting.    A Participant's interest in the Common Stock purchased upon the purchase of Shares under a Share Purchase Right shall be immediately vested and nonforfeitable. 
Page 8 of 12
Table of Contents
         Section 7.5    Nontransferability.    Each Share Purchase Right granted under this Plan shall be nontransferable. During the lifetime of the Participant to whom the Share Purchase Right is granted, the Shares under a Share Purchase Right may be purchased only by the Participant. No right or interest of a Participant in any Share Purchase Right shall be liable for, or subject to, any lien, obligation, or liability of such Participant. 
Article VIII  RESTRICTIONS ON SALE 
         Shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be subject to any such holding restrictions that the Administrator shall determine to be appropriate with respect to any Offering Period. 
Article IX  WITHDRAWAL FROM PARTICIPATION  AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
         A Participant shall be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan with respect to an Offering Period in accordance with this Article IX if he or she ceases to be an Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any reason, including death, before the Acquisition Date for that Offering Period. A Participant may also revoke his or her payroll deduction authorization form for an Offering Period and withdraw from participation in the Plan for that Offering Period by giving written or electronic notice to the Administrator at such time before the Acquisition Date as may be established by the Administrator. In the event of a Participant's withdrawal or deemed withdrawal, all of the payroll deductions credited to his or her account shall be paid to the Participant, or to the Participant's estate in the event of the Participant's death, in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of the notice of withdrawal or death, without any interest thereon, and no further payroll deductions shall be made from his or her Compensation for that Offering Period. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, a Participant's withdrawal (other than due to a termination of employment) during an Offering Period shall not have any effect upon the Participant's eligibility to participate in the Plan during a subsequent Offering Period. 
Article X  GENERAL PROVISIONS

Notwithstanding the foregoing, only the Committee shall have the power to determine the Purchase Price for any Offering Period and to determine any other matter required by the DGCL to be determined by the Board, in which case, any reference to "Administrator" shall mean only the Board or Committee.

         Section 10.6    Freedom of Action.    Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as limiting or preventing the Company or any of its Affiliates from taking any action that it deems appropriate or in its best interest (as determined in its sole and absolute discretion) and no Participant (or person claiming by or through a Participant) shall have any right relating to the diminishment in the value of any account or any associated return as a result of any such action. The foregoing shall not constitute a waiver by a Participant of the terms and provisions of the Plan.

         Section 10.8    Amendment or Termination.

         Section 10.9    Severability.    In the event any portion of the Plan or any action taken pursuant thereto shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provisions had not been included, and the illegal or invalid action shall be null and void. 
         Section 10.10    Assignment.    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.10, this Plan shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, representatives, successors, and assigns.
