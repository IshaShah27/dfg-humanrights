PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE  2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  To Be Held on February 13, 2019
GENERAL INFORMATION   
This Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to Stockholders are being furnished to the stockholders of Magyar Bancorp, Inc. ("Magyar Bancorp" or the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Magyar Bancorp for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, February 13, 2019 at 2:00 p.m., at State Theatre, 15 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 08901. The term "Annual Meeting," as used in this Proxy Statement, includes any adjournment or postponement of such meeting.
This Proxy Statement is dated December 31, 2018 and is first being made available to stockholders on or about December 31, 2018.
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Who Can Vote
The Board of Directors has fixed December 20, 2018 as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the close of business on such date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On December 20, 2018, 5,820,746 shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock were outstanding and held by approximately 405 holders of record. The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. The presence by proxy of the Mutual Holding Company's shares of common stock will assure a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.
How Many Votes You Have
Each holder of shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock outstanding will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record. However, Magyar Bancorp's certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders of record who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of Magyar Bancorp (other than the Mutual Holding Company) are not entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of that 10% limit. A person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate, as well as by any person acting in concert with such person or entity.
Matters to Be Considered
The matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting are the election of three directors, a vote on an advisory basis on executive compensation, a vote on an advisory basis on the frequency of stockholder voting on executive compensation, and the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending September 30, 2019.
You may be asked to vote upon other matters that may properly be submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting. You also may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting. Magyar Bancorp could use any adjournment or postponement for the purpose, among others, of allowing additional time to solicit proxies. How to Vote
We are making our proxy materials available to our stockholders on the Internet. You may read, print and download our Annual Report to Stockholders and our Proxy Statement at www.envisionreports.com/MGYR. On or about December 31, 2018, we mailed a notice to stockholders containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials and vote online. On an ongoing basis, stockholders may request proxy materials in printed form by mail, or electronically by email.
You may vote your shares by Internet, by telephone, by regular mail or in person at the Annual Meeting. Each of these voting options is described in the notice and the Proxy Card. You should complete and return your Proxy Card, or vote using the Internet or telephone voting options, in order to ensure that your vote is counted at the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment of the Annual Meeting, regardless of whether you plan to attend. If you return an executed Proxy Card without marking your instructions, your executed Proxy Card will be voted "FOR" the election of the three director nominees named in this Proxy Statement, "FOR" approval of the compensation for our named executive officers, "FOR" an advisory vote on executive compensation to occur every three years, and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending September 30, 2019.
If you are a stockholder whose shares are not registered in your own name, you will need appropriate documentation from the stockholder of record to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you want to vote your shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock that are held in street name in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need a written proxy card in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares.
The Board of Directors is currently unaware of any other matters that may be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, shares represented by properly submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by the persons named as proxies on the Proxy Card in their best judgment.
Participants in Magyar Bancorp Benefit Plans
If you are a participant in the Magyar Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the Magyar Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, or another benefit plan through which you own shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock, you will receive voting instruction forms with respect to shares you may vote under the plans. Although the trustee or administrator votes all shares held by the plan, each participant may direct the trustee or administrator how to vote the shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock allocated to his or her plan account. If you own shares through any of these plans and do not vote, the respective plan trustees or administrators will vote the shares in accordance with the terms of the respective plans.
Quorum and Vote Required
The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted solely for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. A proxy submitted by a broker that is not voted is sometimes referred to as a broker non-vote.
Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, including shares voted by Magyar Bancorp, MHC and without regard to either broker non-votes or proxies as to which authority to vote for the nominee being proposed is "WITHHELD."
The advisory vote to approve executive compensation and the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm will be determined by a majority of the votes cast, including shares voted by Magyar Bancorp, MHC and without regard to broker non-votes or proxies marked "ABSTAIN." The advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder voting on executive compensation will be determined based on the choice receiving the most votes. Revocability of Proxies
You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by:
Written notices of revocation and other communications regarding the revocation of your proxy should be addressed to:
Magyar Bancorp, Inc.
400 Somerset Street
New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901
Attention:    Karen LeBlon
Corporate Secretary
If your shares are held in street name, your broker votes your shares and you should follow your broker's instructions regarding the revocation of proxies.
Solicitation of Proxies
Magyar Bancorp will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from you. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, Magyar Bancorp will request that banks, brokers and other holders of record send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of Magyar Bancorp common stock and secure their voting instructions. Magyarmay also use several of its regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from stockholders, personally or by telephone, email or letter.

[END TABLE]
 * Less than 1% (footnotes below) Stock Ownership and Retention Policy
The Board believes Directors and Executive Officers (defined as the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents) should have a financial investment in the Company. Each Director is expected to own at least $75,000 in common stock, based on original purchase value (excluding unexercised stock options), the Chief Executive Officer is expected to own at least $150,000 in common stock, based on original purchase value (excluding unexercised stock options), and each Executive Vice President is expected to own at least $50,000 in common stock, based on original purchase value (excluding unexercised stock options), within four years of being elected to the Board or appointed as an officer. The ownership guidelines for Directors and Executive Officers are as follows:
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
The common stock is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). The officers and directors of the Company and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of the common stock are required to file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the common stock. SEC rules require disclosure in the Company's Proxy Statement or Annual Report on Form 10-K of the failure of an officer, director or 10% beneficial owner of the common stock to file a Form 3, 4, or 5 on a timely basis. Based on the Company's review of ownership reports, no officer or director failed to file ownership reports on a timely basis for the year ended September 30, 2018.
    PROPOSAL I - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS   
The Board of Directors currently consists of seven members and is divided into three classes, with one class of directors elected each year. Three directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve for a three-year period and until their successors have been elected and shall qualify.
The Board has nominated John S. Fitzgerald, Thomas Lankey and Joseph A. Yelencsics for election as directors at the Annual Meeting, each of whom has agreed to serve if so elected. Please refer to the sections entitled "Directors and Officers" and "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" for additional information regarding the nominees. It is intended that the proxies solicited on behalf of the Board (other than proxies in which the vote is withheld as to a nominee) will be voted at the Annual Meeting "FOR" the election of each nominee. If a nominee is unable to serve, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute as the Board may recommend. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why a nominee would be unable to serve, if elected. Except as indicated herein, there are no arrangements or understandings between the nominees and any other person pursuant to which such nominees were selected.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE NOMINEES LISTED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

Corporate Governance

Board Independence
The Board has determined that each member of the Board of Directors, with the exception of Messrs.

Mr. Fitzgerald is not considered to be independent due to his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, and Mr. Ansari is not considered to be independent due to his role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In determining the independence of the directors, the Board of Directors considered (i) $50,429 in legal fees paid by Magyar Bank during the year ended September 30, 2018 to a law firm for which Director Stokes serves as a partner, and (ii) the loans outstanding to individual directors made in compliance with applicable banking regulations. Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders
Magyar Bancorp does not have a policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders, although directors are requested to attend these meetings absent unavoidable scheduling conflicts. All of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Board Meetings and Committees
The Board of Directors of Magyar Bancorp met three times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Board of Directors of Magyar Bank met 12 times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. No director attended fewer than 75% in the aggregate of the total number of Board meetings held and the total number of committee meetings on which he served during fiscal 2018, including Board and committee meetings of the Company and the Bank. Executive sessions of the independent directors are regularly scheduled.
The Company has four standing Board committees: Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; Audit Committee; Compensation Committee; and Executive Committee.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending the following to the Board: director nominees, director committee structure and membership, and corporate governance guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for the determination of director independence as defined by NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is considered "independent" as defined in the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is available on the Company's website at www.magbank.com. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of Directors Lukacs, Stokes and Yelencsics.
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting, internal control and internal and external audit processes. This responsibility includes reviewing reports filed with the SEC, the internal audit function, the audit plan and performance of the internal auditor, as well as appointing, overseeing and evaluating the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions that require proxy statement disclosure. Each member of the Audit Committee is considered "independent" as defined in the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards and under SEC Rule 10A-3. The Board believes that Director Hodulik qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is used in the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on the Company's website at www.magbank.com. The report of the Audit Committee is included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. The Audit Committee currently consists of Directors Hodulik, Lukacs, Lankey and Yelencsics.
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and executive management, reviewing and administering overall compensation policy, reviewing performance measures and goals, administering stock-based compensation plans, approving benefit programs, establishing compensation of directors and other matters of personnel policy and practice. Each member of the Compensation Committee is considered "independent" as defined in the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available at the Company's website at www.magbank.com. The Compensation Committee currently consists of Directors Lankey, Hodulik, and Yelencsics. Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is authorized to act, with some exceptions, with the same authority as the Board of Directors of Magyar Bancorp between meetings of the Board. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Executive Committee, which is available at the Company's website at www.magbank.com. The Executive Committee is comprised of Directors Fitzgerald, Lankey, Hodulik and Stokes.
Committee Membership.
The following chart provides information about Board committee membership and the number of meetings that each committee held in fiscal 2018:
————————————
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
The Board has adopted a code of ethics and business conduct for employees, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and all persons performing similar functions. This code is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, full and accurate disclosure and compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This document is available on the Company's website at www.magbank.com. Amendments to and waivers from the code of ethics and business conduct will be disclosed on the Company's website.
As a mechanism to encourage compliance with the code of ethics and business conduct, the Company has established procedures to receive, retain and treat complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters. These procedures ensure that individuals may submit concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters in a confidential and anonymous manner. The code of ethics and business conduct also prohibits the Company from retaliating against any director, executive officer or employee who reports actual or apparent violations of the code of ethics and business conduct. Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors has separated the position of Chairman of the Board from the position of Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors believes this structure provides an efficient and effective leadership model for the Company. Separating the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making, and alignment on corporate strategy. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company. The Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and sets the agenda for Board meetings and presides over meetings of the full Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board also leads regularly scheduled executive sessions of the Board.
To assure effective independent oversight, the Board has adopted a number of governance practices to enhance its independence, including holding regularly scheduled executive sessions of the independent directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, conducts performance evaluations of the Chief Executive Officer. The Board, in conjunction with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, regularly reviews the Board's leadership structure.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Board's role in the Company's risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from the members of the Company's senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory, strategic, cyber and reputational risks. The Board of Directors (or the appropriate Board committee in the case of risks that are reviewed and discussed at committee meetings) receives these reports from the appropriate "risk owner" within the organization, which enables the Board or the appropriate Board committee to identify, mitigate and monitor the material business risks of the Company. When a committee is charged with management of a particular risk, the Chairman of the committee reports risk-related matters addressed by the committee at the next meeting of the full Board of Directors. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.
Board Nominations
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees by evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with the skills and experience that are relevant to the Company's business and who are willing to continue in service are first considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service, or if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, or if the size of the Board is increased, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would solicit suggestions for director candidates from all Board members and may consider candidates submitted by stockholders. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is authorized by its charter, to engage a third party to assist in the identification of director nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would seek to identify a candidate who at a minimum satisfies the following criteria: The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may weight the foregoing criteria differently in different situations, depending on the composition of the Board of Directors at the time.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider any other factors it deems relevant to a candidate's nomination, including the extent to which the candidate helps the Board of Directors reflect the diversity of the Company's shareholders, employees, customers and communities. We do not maintain a specific diversity policy, but the diversity of the Board of Directors is considered in our review of candidates. Diversity includes not only gender and ethnicity, but the various perspectives that come from having differing viewpoints, geographic and cultural backgrounds, and life experiences.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also take into account whether a candidate satisfies the criteria for "independence" as defined in the NASDAQ Corporate Governance Listing Standards, and, if a candidate with financial and accounting expertise is sought for service on the Audit Committee, whether the individual qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert."
Procedures for the Consideration of Board Candidates Submitted by Stockholders
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted procedures for the consideration of Board candidates submitted by stockholders. Stockholders can submit the names of candidates for director by writing to the Corporate Secretary at Magyar Bancorp, Inc., 400 Somerset Street, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901. The submission must include the following information: A nomination submitted by a stockholder for presentation by the stockholder at an Annual Meeting of stockholders must comply with the procedural and informational requirements described in "Advance Notice of Business to be Conducted at an Annual Meeting."
Stockholder Communications with the Board

Transactions with Certain Related Persons
Federal law and regulation generally require that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors of a bank be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the general public and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. However, applicable regulations permit executive officers and directors to receive the same terms through loan programs that are widely available to other employees, as long as the director or executive officer is not given preferential treatment compared to the other participating employees. Magyar Bank extends loans to its executive officers and directors on the same terms as available to all employees, in compliance with these regulations.
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits an issuer from: (1) extending or maintaining credit; (2) arranging for the extension of credit; or (3) renewing an extension of credit in the form of a personal loan for an officer or director. There are several exceptions to this general prohibition, one of which is applicable to Magyar Bank. Sarbanes-Oxley does not apply to loans made by a depository institution that is insured by the FDIC and is subject to the insider lending restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. All loans to the Company's directors and officers are made in conformity with the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. The Company offers a 1% reduction to its publicly available interest rates on loans to employees and directors of the Bank. All such loans to the Company's directors and executive officers are made subject to the Bank's credit standards and are subject to approval by the Bank's Board of Directors. During the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018, there were no new loans made to the Company's directors and executive officers.

Joseph A. Yelencsics Executive Compensation
Determination of Executive Compensation
The Company's philosophy is to align executive compensation with the interests of its stockholders and to determine appropriate compensation levels that will enable it to meet the following objectives:
The Company considers a number of factors in its decisions regarding executive compensation, including, but not limited to, the level of responsibility and performance of the individual executive officers, the overall performance of the Company and a peer group analysis of compensation paid at institutions of comparable size and complexity. The Company also considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the compensation of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer review the same information in connection with this recommendation.
The base salary levels for the Company's executive officers are set to reflect the duties and levels of responsibilities inherent in the position and to reflect competitive conditions in the banking business in the Company's market area. Comparative salaries paid by other financial institutions are considered in establishing the salary for the given executive officer. In setting salaries for fiscal year 2018, the Board of Directors utilized bank compensation surveys compiled by the American Bankers Association as well as other survey data prepared by trade groups and independent benefit consultants. The Company did not engage a compensation consultant to assist in establishing executive compensation in fiscal year 2018. In setting the base salaries, the Board of Directors also considered a number of factors relating to the executive officers, including individual performance, job responsibilities, experience level, ability and the knowledge of the position. These factors are considered subjectively and none of the factors are accorded a specific weight. Summary Compensation Table. The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, certain information as to the total remuneration paid by Magyar Bank to its Chief Executive Officer as well as to the two most highly compensated executive officers of Magyar Bank, other than the Chief Executive Officer, who received total salary and bonus in excess of $100,000.

 Benefit Plans 
Employment Agreements.  Magyar Bancorp entered into an employment agreement, effective November 1, 2007, with John S. Fitzgerald, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and of Magyar Bank. At that time, Mr. Fitzgerald was the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and Magyar Bank. The agreement had an initial term of 36 calendar months. Commencing December 31, 2007, and continuing on December 31st of each year thereafter, the agreement renews for an additional period such that the remaining term is thirty-six months, unless written notice of non-renewal is provided. The employment agreement was amended in July 2012 in order to reflect Mr. Fitzgerald's promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Magyar Bank.
Under the agreement, the current base salary is $415,000 per year, which may be increased but not decreased. In addition, Mr. Fitzgerald is entitled to participate at no cost to executive in all benefit plans provided uniformly to other permanent full-time employees.
If Mr. Fitzgerald voluntarily terminates his employment, or his employment is terminated for cause, no benefits are provided under the agreement. In the event (i) of the involuntary termination of the executive's employment for any reason other than disability, retirement or termination for cause, or (ii) the executive's resignation upon the occurrence of certain events constituting "constructive termination," including failure to appoint him to his current position, a material reduction in his duties, functions or responsibilities, or a breach by the Company of the agreement, Mr. Fitzgerald would be entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times his then current base salary. In the event that the severance payment provisions of the employment agreement are triggered other than following a change in control, the executive would be entitled to a cash severance benefit in the amount of approximately $830,000. If Mr. Fitzgerald's employment is involuntarily terminated at any time following a change in control of Magyar Bancorp or Magyar Bank, he is entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times the sum of his then current base salary plus any earned and accrued but unpaid bonus for the year of termination. Accordingly, in the event that the severance payment provisions of the employment agreement are triggered following a change in control occurring on the last day of the 2018 fiscal year, the executive would also be entitled to a cash severance benefit in the amount of approximately $940,000.
Magyar Bancorp also entered into an employment agreement, effective July 26, 2012, with Jon R. Ansari, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and Magyar Bank. The agreement had an initial term of 12 calendar months. Commencing December 31, 2012, and continuing on December 31st of each year thereafter, the agreement renews for an additional period such that the remaining term will be 12 months, unless written notice of non-renewal is provided.
Under the agreement, the current base salary is $305,010 per year, which may be increased but not decreased. The terms of Mr. Ansari's employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Mr. Fitzgerald's employment agreement.
In the event of his involuntary termination of employment without cause or his resignation for the same reasons as under Mr. Fitzgerald's employment, Mr. Ansari will also be entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times his then current base salary. If Mr. Ansari's employment is terminated other than for cause or following a change in control, Mr. Ansari would be entitled to a cash severance benefit in the amount of approximately $610,020. If Mr. Ansari's employment is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) at any time following a change in control of Magyar Bancorp or Magyar Bank, he is entitled to a severance benefit equal to two times the sum of his then current base salary plus any earned and accrued but unpaid bonus for the year of termination. If a change in control and termination of employment had occurred on the last day of the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. Ansari would have been entitled to a cash severance benefit in the amount of approximately $695,020. If either executive's employment is terminated for any of the reasons specified in the preceding paragraph that would entitle the executive to a severance payment, the Company will cause to be continued for 24 months, at its sole expense, life insurance coverage and non-taxable medical and dental insurance coverage substantially identical to the coverage maintained by the Company and/or the Bank prior to the termination of his employment.
The agreements provide that in no event shall the aggregate payments or benefits to be made or afforded to the executive under the agreement constitute an "excess parachute payment," and in order to avoid such a result, such payments or benefits will be reduced, if necessary, to an amount which is one dollar ($1.00) less than an amount equal to three (3) times the executive's "base amount," as determined in accordance with said Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
The agreements also provide that, other than following a change in control, the executives shall not compete with Magyar Bank or the Company for a period of one year following their termination of employment with Magyar Bank or the Company.
Change-in-Control Agreement. In June 2012, the Company entered into a one-year change-in-control agreement with Brian Stanley, the Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of the Company and Magyar Bank, that provides certain benefits in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control of the Company or Magyar Bank. Commencing on each anniversary date, the agreement will be renewed for an additional year so that the remaining term will be one year, subject to termination by the Board of Directors on notice of non-renewal. The change-in-control agreement enables the Company to offer Mr. Stanley certain protections against termination without just cause in the event of a change in control.
Following a change in control of the Company or Magyar Bank, Mr. Stanley is entitled under the agreement to a payment if his employment is terminated during the term of such agreement, other than for just cause, or if he voluntarily terminates employment during the term of such agreement as a result of a demotion, loss of title, office or significant authority (in each case, other than as a result of the fact that either Magyar Bank or Magyar Bancorp is merged into another entity in connection with a change in control and will not operate as a stand-alone, independent entity), reduction in his annual compensation or benefits, or relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 30 miles from its location immediately prior to the change in control. If there is a change in control followed by a termination of employment, Mr. Stanley will receive a cash payment equal to the sum of his highest rate of base salary and the highest rate of bonus awarded to him during the prior three years, payable in a lump sum. In accordance with the foregoing, if a change of control had occurred as of September 30, 2018 that resulted in a termination of employment, Mr. Stanley would have been entitled to a cash payment in the aggregate amount of approximately $218,210. In addition to the cash payment, Mr. Stanley is entitled to receive life, medical, and dental coverage, at no cost, for a period of 12 months from the date of termination. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the change-in-control agreements, payments under the change in control agreements are limited so that they will not constitute an excess parachute payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Stock-Based Incentive Plan. In 2007, stockholders approved Magyar Bancorp's Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Plan") to provide officers, employees and directors with additional incentives to promote the growth and performance of the Company. The Equity Plan authorized the issuance of up to 381,260 shares of Magyar Bancorp common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock awards. No more than 108,931 shares could be issued as restricted stock awards. As of September 30, 2018, there were no options outstanding to acquire shares of common stock and no shares of restricted stock outstanding and subject to future vesting, and no further awards may be made under the plan.
The Company does not have any equity compensation program that was not approved by its stockholders, other than the ESOP. Outstanding Equity Awards at Year End. There were no outstanding equity awards as of September 30, 2018 for the Named Executive Officers.
Defined Benefit Pension Plan. Magyar Bank sponsors the Magyar Savings Bank Retirement Plan, which is a qualified, tax-exempt defined benefit plan (the "Retirement Plan"). The Retirement Plan was frozen as to new accruals effective as of February 15, 2006. Magyar Bank annually contributes an amount to the plan necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). The regular form of retirement benefit is a life annuity (if the participant is single) and a joint and survivor annuity (if the participant is married); however, various alternative forms of joint and survivor annuities may be selected instead. In the event a participant dies before his annuity starting date, death benefits will generally be paid to the participant's surviving spouse in the form of a pre-retirement survivor annuity.
A participant who retires on his normal retirement date is entitled to an annual benefit equal to his accrued benefit based on a retirement benefit formula equal to the sum of 35% of the participant's average annual compensation plus 22.75% of his average annual compensation in excess of covered compensation. However, participants who have earned less than 35 years of service at the end of the plan year in which they attain normal retirement age will be entitled to reduced benefits. The minimum amount of annual retirement benefit provided to participants who retire on their normal retirement date will be equal to 1.5% of the participant's average annual compensation multiplied by the participant's number of years of service, up to a maximum of 30 years.
Executive Supplemental Retirement Income Agreements. Magyar Bank adopted an Executive Supplemental Retirement Income Agreement for Jon Ansari and for John Fitzgerald effective as of January 1, 2006 ("2006 SERPs"). The 2006 SERPs are designed to provide an annual benefit to Mr. Ansari at age 65 of $141,143 and to Mr. Fitzgerald at age 65 of $102,362. For these purposes, Messrs. Ansari and Fitzgerald have each established a secular trust in connection with the adoption of the 2006 SERPs. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, Magyar Bank contributed $40,895 and $43,792 to the secular trusts established for Mr. Ansari and Mr. Fitzgerald, respectively, under the 2006 SERP.
Director Fees
Each of the individuals who serves as a director of Magyar Bancorp also serves as a director of Magyar Bank, and, with the exception of John Fitzgerald and Jon Ansari, earns director fees in that capacity. Magyar Bank pays each director an annual retainer fee of $33,800. The Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an annual retainer fee of $70,500 and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an annual retainer fee of $38,800. Each director, except Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Ansari, also receives a fee of $550 for each committee meeting attended. The chairman of the Audit Committee also receives an additional retainer fee of $5,000, and members of the Audit Committee are paid a fee of $1,100 for attendance at committee meetings. Aggregate fees paid to directors by Magyar Bancorp and Magyar Bank were $275,815 for fiscal year 2018. Directors' Compensation
The following table sets forth for the year ended September 30, 2018 certain information as to the total remuneration paid to the Company's directors other than Messrs. Fitzgerald and Ansari.

 Director Supplemental Retirement Income and Deferred Compensation Agreements. In 1996, Magyar Bank entered into Director Supplemental Retirement Income and Deferred Compensation Agreements with its directors, including Messrs. Andrew G. Hodulik, Thomas Lankey, Martin A. Lukacs, Edward C. Stokes, III, and Joseph A. Yelencsics, in order to provide retirement, disability and death benefits to such directors and their beneficiaries. The agreements were amended and restated effective January 1, 2006, in order to comply with changes in the tax laws under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code Section 409A"). The agreements with each director replace a prior non-qualified deferred compensation plan under which each director deferred all or a portion of his or her board fees, committee fees and retainer and such deferrals generated earnings at a 10% interest rate. Under the amended and restated agreements, each director makes an elective contribution equal to such director's voluntary monthly pre-tax deferrals of board fees, committee fees and or retainer to a so-called secular trust (i.e., a trust where the individual is the grantor) established by such director with the assistance of Magyar Bank; each such trust is referred to as a retirement income trust fund. In addition, Magyar Bank contributes an amount to the retirement income trust funds to supplement the directors' deferrals, and replace the 10% interest that would have accrued under the prior nonqualified plan. Magyar Bank also makes a contribution, actuarially determined to be equal to the amount necessary to support the annual retirement benefit payable to the director once he reaches his benefit age, based upon a percentage of the director's total board fees, committee fees and/or retainer in the twelve-month period prior to the date on which the director is entitled to receive retirement benefits. For the 2018 plan year, Magyar Bank contributed an aggregate of $228,720 to the pension plan portion of the agreements. Provided a director has served for at least five years, the director's retirement benefit will be at least 50% of such board fees, committee fees and/or retainer, with a maximum retirement benefit of 60%, based on years of service. If a director serves less than five years at termination of service, the benefit to such director would be between 12.5% and 20% of such fees and/or retainer. Any director who serves as board chairman for a five-year term will be entitled to receive a maximum benefit equal to 75% of his fees and/or retainer. Funds contributed to the retirement income trust fund will be invested by the trustee and are taxable to the director in the year of the contribution. Each director is annually given a limited period of time following Magyar Bank's contribution to the director's retirement income trust fund to withdraw the contribution to such director's retirement income trust fund, provided, however, that if a director exercises his withdrawal rights, Magyar Bank will thereafter cease making contributions to the retirement income trust fund and will instead commence bookkeeping entries representing phantom contributions towards the director's accrued benefit account.
Upon retirement, the amounts accumulated in the director's retirement income trust fund and/or phantom contributions to any accrued benefit account established for such director, if any, will be annuitized and paid in monthly installments for the payout period unless the director has elected a lump sum payment. In the event the director dies after attaining his benefit age but prior to commencement or completion of his monthly payments, the amounts accrued for the benefit of the director will be paid to his or her beneficiary in either monthly installments or a lump sum. In the event a director has elected to receive a lump sum benefit and dies while serving as a director, the balance of his benefit will be paid to his beneficiary in a lump sum. In the event the director's service is terminated prior to benefit age due to disability, the director will also be entitled to a lump sum benefit.
   PROPOSAL II – ADVISORY NON-BINDING VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   
We are asking stockholders to vote in an advisory, non-binding manner on the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K (including the compensation table and accompanying narrative discussion). Item 402 of Regulation S-K is the SEC regulation that sets forth what companies must include in their proxy statement as to compensation. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to vote on our executive pay program through the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.
   PROPOSAL III - ADVISORY NON-BINDING VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF SAY-ON-PAY VOTES   
Pursuant to SEC rules, our stockholders are also being asked to vote, on an advisory basis, on how frequently our shareholders should have a "Say on Pay" vote in the future. Although this frequency vote is advisory and is not binding on the Board, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering how frequently to hold the Say on Pay votes. You may choose from the following alternatives: every year, every two years, every three years or you may abstain. We will ask you to vote on an advisory basis on the frequency of Say on Pay votes at least once every six years. Stockholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the Board's recommendation.
The Board believes and is recommending that the Say on Pay vote should be conducted every three years. The Compensation Committee, which administers the Company's executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders in these votes and will continue to consider the outcome of these votes in making its decisions on executive compensation.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE TO CONDUCT FUTURE SAY ON PAY VOTES EVERY THREE YEARS.
   PROPOSAL IV - RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS   
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was RSM US LLP ("RSM"). On May 8, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") decided to dismiss Baker Tilly Virchow Krause LLP ("Baker Tilly") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective May 11, 2018. The audit reports of Baker Tilly on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the year ended September 30, 2017 and through May 11, 2018, there were no disagreements with Baker Tilly on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, that, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Baker Tilly, would have caused them to make reference to such disagreements in its report on the Company's financial statements for such periods, and no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). The Audit Committee appointed RSM to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective May 11, 2018. During the two most recent fiscal years and through May 11, 2018, the Company did not consult with RSM regarding any matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee has approved the engagement of RSM to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. That appointment is subject to ratification by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Stockholder ratification of the selection of RSM is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board is submitting the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection of RSM the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, at its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Representatives of RSM are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees Paid to Our Auditors 
Set forth below is certain information concerning aggregate fees for professional services rendered by RSM and Baker Tilly during fiscal years 2018 and 2017:
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by RSM for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements, review of the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by RSM in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements was $114,450 during fiscal year 2018.
The aggregate fees billed to the Company by Baker Tilly for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements, review of the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by Baker Tilly in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements were $22,000 and $120,000 during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively.
Audit-Related Fees. There were no "Audit-Related Fees" not already reported in "Audit Fees" in fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
Tax Fees. There were no tax fees billed in fiscal years 2018 or 2017.
All Other Fees. There were no "Other Fees" billed for fiscal years 2018 or 2017.
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accountants
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chair when necessary, with subsequent reporting to the Audit Committee. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to report to the Audit Committee quarterly regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval policy, and the fees for the services performed to date. Required Vote and Recommendation of the Board
In order to ratify the appointment of RSM as independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, including shares voted by Magyar Bancorp, MHC, but without regard to broker non-votes on proxies marked "ABSTAIN."
