At the Meeting, you will be asked to elect two Class II directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or disqualification. In addition, the Board has adopted policies which provide that (a) no director shall hold office for more than 15 years and (b) a director shall retire as of December 31st of the calendar year in which he or she reaches his or her 74th birthday, unless a waiver of such requirement has been adopted by a majority of the other directors. These policies may be changed by the directors without a stockholder vote. 
Information concerning the nominees and other relevant factors is provided below. Using the enclosed proxy card or voting by the Internet or by telephone, a Stockholder may vote his or her shares for or against, or abstain from voting with respect to, the election of either nominee.

Board Composition and Leadership Structure 
The Company's business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of five members, four of whom are Independent Directors. The Board elects the Company's officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly valuation of the Company's assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of the Company's financing arrangements and oversight of its investment activities. 
The Board's role in the management of the Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company's investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GSAM as part of its day-to-day management of the Company's investment activities. The Board reviews risk management processes at both regular and special Board meetings throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GSAM as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board's risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with the Company's investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. Stockholders should note, however, that the Board's oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of the Company's investments. The Board also has primary responsibility for the valuation of the Company's assets.  The Board has established an Audit Committee, Governance and Nominating Committee, Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee and Contract Review Committee. The scope of each committee's responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. 
Jaime Ardila, an Independent Director, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Stockholders for Mr. Ardila to lead the Board because of his familiarity with the Company's portfolio companies, his broad corporate background and experience with financial and investment matters and his significant senior management experience, as described above. Mr. Ardila generally acts as a liaison between management, officers and attorneys between meetings of the Board and presides over all executive sessions of the Independent Directors without management. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its size creates an efficient corporate governance structure that provides opportunity for direct communication and interaction between management and the Board. 
The Board had nine formal meetings in 2018. Each continuing director that was a member of the Board during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees during the periods that he or she served. To promote effectiveness of the Board, directors are strongly encouraged to attend regularly scheduled Board meetings in person. 
None of the Company's directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Committees of the Board 
Audit Committee 
The current members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Ardila, Mr. Kari, Ms. Lane and Ms. McGee, each of whom is an Independent Director. Mr. Ardila simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, and the Board has determined that his simultaneous service on the audit committees of other public companies does not impair his ability to effectively serve on the Audit Committee. Mr. Kari serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board and the Audit Committee have determined that Mr. Kari is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing matters relating to the appointment and activities of the Company's auditors, audit plans and procedures, various accounting and financial reporting issues and changes in accounting policies, and reviewing the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent public accountants. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. The Audit Committee's charter is available on the Company's website (https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com).

The current members of the Governance and Nominating Committee are Mr. Ardila, Mr. Kari, Ms. Lane and Ms. McGee, each of whom is an Independent Director. Mr. Ardila serves as the Chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying, researching and nominating Independent Directors for election by the Stockholders, selecting nominees to fill vacancies on the Board or a committee of the Board, developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and management.  All candidates nominated for an Independent Director position must meet applicable independence requirements and have the capacity to address financial and legal issues and exercise reasonable business judgment. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers a variety of criteria in evaluating candidates (including candidates nominated by a Stockholder), including (1) experience in business, financial or investment matters or in other fields of endeavor; (2) financial literacy and/or whether he or she is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K; (3) reputation; (4) ability to attend scheduled Board and committee meetings; (5) general availability to attend to Board business on short notice; (6) actual or potential business, family or other conflicts bearing on either the candidate's independence or the business of the Company; (7) length of potential service; (8) commitment to the representation of the interests of the Company and the Stockholders; (9) commitment to maintaining and improving his or her skills and education; (10) experience in corporate governance and best business practices; and (11) the diversity that he or she would bring to the Board's composition. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee considers nominees properly recommended by a Stockholder. The Company's bylaws provide that for any nomination to be properly brought by a Stockholder for a meeting, such Stockholder must comply with advance notice requirements and provide the Company with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a Stockholder's notice must be received at the Company's principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of Stockholders. The Company's bylaws further provide that nominations of persons for election to the Board at a special meeting may be made only by or at the direction of the Board and, provided that the Board has determined that directors will be elected at the meeting, by a Stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions of the bylaws. The Governance and Nominating Committee's charter is available on the Company's website (https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com). 
The Governance and Nominating Committee held four formal meetings in 2018. 
Compensation Committee 
The current members of the Compensation Committee are Mr. Ardila, Mr. Kari, Ms. Lane and Ms. McGee, each of whom is an Independent Director. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining, or recommending to the Board for determination, the compensation, if any, of the Company's chief executive officer and all other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also assists the Board with matters related to compensation generally, except with respect to compensation of the directors. As discussed in "Compensation of Directors," below, it is the responsibility of the Independent Directors to review their own compensation and recommend to all of the directors the appropriate level of compensation. As none of the Company's executive officers currently is compensated by the Company, the Compensation Committee does not produce and/or review a report on executive compensation practices. The Compensation Committee's charter is available on the Company's website (https://www.goldmansachsbdc.com). 
The Compensation Committee did not hold any formal meetings in 2018. 
Compliance Committee 
The current members of the Compliance Committee are Mr. Ardila, Mr. Kari, Ms. Lane and Ms. McGee, each of whom is an Independent Director. Mr. Ardila serves as Chairman of the Compliance Committee.

Investment Management Agreement 
The Company is party to an investment management agreement, pursuant to which the Company pays GSAM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc., a fee for investment management services consisting of a management fee based on the Company's gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) and an incentive fee based on the performance of the Company's investments. Certain of the Company's officers are also officers and employees of GSAM. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the management fee was calculated at (i) an annual rate of 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) (the "Original Rate") through June 14, 2018 and (ii) an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter) (the "New Rate") thereafter, in each case, of the average value of the Company's gross assets at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The management fee for any partial quarter (including any quarter during which both the Original Rate and the New Rate were in effect) was prorated based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid GSAM a total of $34.35 million in fees (excluding fees that are accrued but not paid) pursuant to the investment management agreement, which consisted of $17.18 million in management fees and $17.17 million in incentive fees. 
License Agreement 
The Company is party to a license agreement with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs pursuant to which the Company has been granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the "Goldman Sachs" name. Under this agreement, the Company does not have a right to use the Goldman Sachs name if GSAM or another affiliate of Goldman Sachs is not the Company's investment adviser or if the Company's continued use of such license results in a violation of applicable law, results in a regulatory burden or has adverse regulatory consequences. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company has no legal right to the "Goldman Sachs" name. 
Co-Investment Opportunities 
The Company has in the past co-invested, and in the future may co-invest, on a concurrent basis with other funds managed by GSAM and its affiliates, but not if such co-investment is impermissible under existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations or GSAM's allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only if the Company receives an order from the SEC permitting the Company to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted the Company, GS PMMC and GS MMLC, as well as certain other funds managed by GSAM in the future, the exemptive relief to make negotiated co-investments, subject to certain terms and conditions in the exemptive relief. 
Related Party Transaction Review Policy 
The Audit Committee conducts quarterly reviews of any potential related party transactions brought to its attention and, during these reviews, it also considers any conflicts of interest brought to its attention pursuant to the Company's Code of Ethics. Each of the Company's directors and executive officers is instructed and periodically reminded to inform GSAM Compliance of any potential related party transactions. In addition, each such director and executive officer completes a questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information about any potential related party transactions.  PROPOSAL 2

The Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the "Policy") adopted by the Audit Committee sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services performed by an independent auditor for the Company may be pre-approved. Services may be pre-approved specifically by the Audit Committee as a whole or, in certain circumstances, by the Audit Committee Chairman, or by such other members of the Audit Committee who may be granted authority by the Audit Committee to pre-approve services on its behalf. In addition, subject to specified cost limitations, certain services may be pre-approved under the provisions of the Policy. The Policy provides that the Audit Committee will consider whether the services provided by an independent auditor are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Policy provides for periodic review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the services that may be provided by the independent auditor. 
De Minimis Waiver. The pre-approval requirements of the Policy may be waived with respect to the provision of non-audit services that are permissible for an independent auditor to perform, provided (1) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues subject to pre-approval that was paid to the independent auditors during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (2) such services were not recognized by the Company at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (3) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more members of the Audit Committee to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee, pursuant to the pre-approval provisions of the Policy. The Audit Committee did not approve any of the audit, audit-related, tax, or other non-audit fees described above pursuant to the "de minimis exceptions" set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) and Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. 
Pre-Approval of Non-Audit Services Provided to GSAM. The Policy provides that, in addition to requiring pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided to the Company, the Audit Committee will pre-approve those non-audit services provided to GSAM (and entities controlling, controlled by or under common control with GSAM that provide ongoing services to the Company) where the engagement relates directly to the operations or financial reporting of the Company. The Audit Committee has considered these fees and the nature of the services rendered, and has concluded that they are compatible with maintaining the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Except as described above, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP did not provide any audit services, audit-related services, tax services or other non-audit services to GSAM or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with GSAM that provides ongoing services to the Company that the Audit Committee was required to approve pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. 
ON FEBRUARY 27, 2019, THE BOARD, INCLUDING EACH OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  Audit Committee Report (1) 
The following is the report of the Audit Committee of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. (the "Company") with respect to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Audited Financial Statements"). 
The Audit Committee has: (a) reviewed and discussed the Audited Financial Statements with the management of the Company; (b) discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"); and (c) received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor the auditor's independence. 
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Company for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Company's independent auditor. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on its consideration of the Audited Financial Statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the Company's independent auditor, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Audited Financial Statements be accepted by the Board of Directors and included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the SEC.

(1)  The material in this report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the  SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any  general incorporation language in any such filing.  
[END TABLE]
OTHER BUSINESS 
The management of the Company does not know of any other matters to be brought before the Meeting. If such matters are properly brought before the Meeting, proxies that do not contain specific instructions to the contrary will be voted in accordance with the judgment of Neena Reddy and Joseph McClain, who are the persons named as proxies. 
VOTE REQUIRED FOR THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTOR AND 
APPROVAL OF OTHER MATTERS AT THE MEETING 
A quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting is established by the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting. Stockholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. There were 40,267,216 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on March 18, 2019. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. Cumulative voting is not permitted. 
Election of Directors 
The election of each nominee requires a majority of the votes cast by all Stockholders present, in person or by proxy, at the Meeting, provided that if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the date the Company first mails the notice of such meeting to the Stockholders, the number of nominees for the directorships (or, if applicable, the directorships of a particular class of directors) exceeds the number of such directors to be elected, such directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. Under the Company's bylaws, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that director's election). 
Ratification of Auditor 
Approval of Proposal 2, the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, requires a majority of the votes by all Stockholders present, in person or by proxy, at the Meeting. 
Broker Non-Votes 
Broker "non-votes" are shares held in an account with an Authorized Institution for which the broker indicates that instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote, and the broker does not have discretionary voting authority with respect to a non-routine proposal. As broker non-votes are entitled to vote on Proposal 2, broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
Proposal 1 is a non-routine matter. As a result, if you hold shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or nominee will not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to Proposal 1, the election of two Class II directors. Therefore, if you do not vote and you do not give your broker or other nominee specific instructions on how to vote for you, then your shares will have no effect on Proposal 1. 
Proposal 2, the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, is a routine matter. As a result, if you beneficially own your shares and you do not provide your broker or nominee with voting instructions, then your broker, bank or nominee will be able to vote your shares for you on Proposal 2.  Abstentions 
Abstentions will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be voted for or against the Proposal for which the proxy card has been marked "Abstain". Accordingly, abstentions will have no effect on Proposal 1, and the effect of a vote against Proposal 2. 
Adjournment 
If less than a quorum is present at the Meeting or if an insufficient number of votes is present for the approval of the Proposals, the chairman of the Meeting shall have the power to adjourn the Meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the Meeting. 
A vote may be taken on either Proposal prior to any such adjournment if there are sufficient votes for approval of such Proposal.
