 Our 2018 Disappointments Despite those striking achievements, 2018 fell short for us in two categories: total shareholder return and the message you sent to us at last year's annual shareholders' meeting regarding say-on-pay. We were disappointed by the fact that, for our November 30, 2018 fiscal year, our total shareholder return was -15.8%. The entire financial services industry was similarly impacted and most value and mid-cap stocks also declined precipitously, but that is no consolation. Nonetheless, we have confidence that, in the longer run, the market is rational, and we believe that our total shareholder return ultimately will reflect the progress that our management has driven over the past few years. We were also disappointed by the fact that, although our advisory say-on-pay vote was passed by our shareholders, that consent was not the result of a strong majority. We transformed that disappointment into immediate action, redoubling our engagement with our fellow shareholders and the proxy advisory firms and, most importantly, making meaningful amendments to the executive compensation program we adopted in January 2018, all of which directly responded to the feedback we received from you, our fellow shareholders. Your Vote Matters Please accept our most sincere gratitude for your investment and partnership with us. We genuinely hope we will see you at our annual shareholders' meeting. If you are not able to attend in person, we ask you to vote by proxy in support of our recommendations. The proxy materials contain necessary information about the matters on which we are asking you to vote. The Jefferies team is open to addressing any questions regarding these matters you may have. Thank you again for your support. Sincerely, The Jefferies Board of Directors   "We have confidence that . . . the market is rational, and we believe that our total shareholder return ultimately will reflect the progress that our management has driven over the past few years." We made "meaningful amendments to the executive compensation program . . . all of which directly responded to the feedback we received from you, our fellow shareholders."

Proxy Summary
Jefferies Financial Group is a diversified financial services company engaged in investment banking and capital markets, asset management and principal investing. Jefferies Group, our largest subsidiary, is the largest independent full-service global investment banking firm headquartered in the U.S. In our merchant banking business, we own a diverse portfolio of businesses and investments that have the potential for significant long-term value creation.
On June 5, 2018, we completed the sale of 48% of National Beef to Marfrig Global Foods S.A., reducing our ownership in National Beef from 79% to 31%. During the third quarter of 2018, we sold 100% of our equity interests in Garcadia, our auto dealer group, and our associated real estate to our former partners, the Garff family. These sales, and particularly the related deconsolidation of National Beef, helped transform Jefferies Financial into a more focused financial services company.
In furtherance of our financial services strategy, on October 1, 2018, we amalgamated our primary financial services operating businesses into one platform by transferring our 50% membership interest in Berkadia and our Leucadia Asset Management seed investments into Jefferies Group.
The chart below provides an overview of Jefferies Financial Group. For more information, please see our Form 10-K filed on January 29, 2019.

Proxy Summary
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Banking: We uniformly heard displeasure with our banking mechanism, under which executives could earn banked but unvested RSUs for each individual performance year even if performance for subsequent years is below expectations.  We eliminated banking 
 Absolute TSR Measurement: Shareholders and proxy advisory firms favored some element of relative total shareholder return instead of an exclusive, absolute TSR performance measurement.  We implemented a relative TSR performance threshold starting in the current year 
 Insufficient Articulation of Peer Selection Process: Certain shareholders and the proxy advisory firms asked us to review and amend our peer list and to explain in greater detail why we selected the peers that we did.  We reshaped and expanded our peer list and provided a more fulsome articulation of our peer-selection reasoning 
 Performance Targets: Certain shareholders expressed an issue with our targeted performance metrics for ROTDE and TSR.  We raised our performance ranges from a 5% threshold and 8% target for each of ROTDE and TSR to a 6% threshold and 9% target; the higher performance target reduces overall award magnitude at the former 8% target by nearly 17% 
 Magnitude of the Overall Award: Certain shareholders believed that the overall magnitude of our executive compensation package was too high.  We reduced the targeted cash portion of our compensation plan by 28% and the overall targeted compensation by 10% 
 What We Heard  What We Committed 
 No Increases to Equity. We heard concern that, because we employed a one-time equity grant for the 2018 Plan, 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan, the equity portions of those Plans could be increased at a later time.  We confirmed and committed that no additional equity would be granted under those Plans 
 Exercise of Negative Discretion. We heard questions whether we could employ negative discretion as it pertained to the equity portion of the 2018 Plan, 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan.  We confirmed that we retain negative discretion and that no positive discretion is allowed; that is, we may reduce equity awards, but will not increase them

Corporate Governance Matters
Election of Directors
Fiscal year 2018 was a year of transformation for our Board of Directors. Further aligning the operations of Jefferies Financial Group and its largest operating subsidiary, Jefferies Group, the respective boards of each entity created mirrored boards in the fourth quarter. To accomplish that, the Jefferies Financial Group directors and the Jefferies Group directors combined, and that combined group of individuals became the directors of Jefferies Financial Group, and those same individuals became the directors of Jefferies Group – accordingly, the phrase "mirrored boards." Mirroring the boards means shareholders will benefit from the combined expertise from both boards as we chart the future of the less complex, more transparent financial services platform we have become. Practically speaking, for purposes of this Proxy Statement, this change means that, in addition to those nine incumbent directors from legacy Jefferies, our slate of directors now includes Barry Alperin, Jacob Katz and MaryAnne Gilmartin, who were voted onto our Board in November 2018.
Our directors are elected at each annual meeting of shareholders and hold office for a one-year term. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and chooses nominees for our Board with the primary goal of presenting a diverse slate of candidates who will serve the Board, its Committees, Jefferies and our shareholders, taking into account the attributes of each candidate's professional skillset and credentials, as well as gender, age, ethnicity and personal background. In evaluating nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews each candidate's background and assesses each candidate's independence, skills, experience and expertise based upon myriad factors, including the candidate's individual director assessment. Directors should have the highest professional and personal ethics, integrity and character that conform to our standards. Directors should also have experience at the governance and policy-making level in their respective fields. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider whether a candidate for director has a proven professional background that displays the ability to make important judgments as Board members. The Committee also determines whether a candidate's skills and experience complement existing Board members' skills and experience.
As illustrated by their biographies and highlighted in the chart below, each of our directors was chosen because his or her background provides each director with the experience and skillset geared toward helping us succeed. Our directors bring to us strong executive operating experience; expertise in the financial services sector; accounting expertise; broad experience in such diverse sectors as oil and gas, mining, investment management, retail food, real estate, private equity, communications, media, government and international banking, among others; and a meaningful commitment to community and public service. That wealth of knowledge and experience is ideally suited to our diverse financial services and merchant banking platforms.

Risk Oversight
Our Board of Directors is responsible for the general oversight of risks that affect us. To further strengthen and add more focus to that responsibility, in late 2018 our Board formed a new Risk and Liquidity Oversight Committee, which is chaired by Linda Adamany and which has as its members MaryAnne Gilmartin, Jack Katz and Stu Reese. The Risk and Liquidity Oversight Committee oversees Jefferies' enterprise risk management framework; approves risk management policies; monitors major risk exposures, including among others investment risk, capital risk, funding risk, liquidity risk, new product and business risk, cybersecurity risk, legal and regulatory risk, environmental risk and reputational risk; and oversees management's controls relating to engaging in risk.
Part of the Board's risk responsibilities involves approval of certain investments. Our Board must be consulted with and approve potential investments that require expenditure above $150 million. The Board has delegated to any two of Messrs. Handler, Friedman and Steinberg, acting together, approval to make investments below that threshold.
Our Board also fulfills its risk oversight role through the operations of its various committees. Our Board receives periodic reports on each committee's activities. The Audit Committee has responsibility for risk oversight in connection with its review of our financial reports filed with the SEC. The Audit Committee receives reports from our CFO, our internal audit department and our independent auditors in connection with the review of our quarterly and annual financial statements regarding significant financial transactions, accounting and reporting matters, internal control over financial reporting, critical accounting estimates and management's exercise of judgment in accounting matters. When reporting on such matters, our independent auditors also provide their assessment of management's report and conclusions. Our Audit Committee receives reports from our Chief Compliance Officer in accordance with our Whistle Blower Policy. Our Audit Committee also oversees our Related Person Transaction Policy. Additionally, with respect to Jefferies Group, its risk management team continuously monitors its various business groups, the level of risk they are taking and the efficacy of potential risk mitigation strategies and presents such information to Jefferies Group's senior management and our Board.

Corporate Governance Matters
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
Our Board recognizes the negative effect poor environmental practices and human capital management may have on us and our returns and therefore has established Board reporting requirements regarding risk exposure and risk mitigation efforts in these areas. The periodic reports the Board receives enables the Board to monitor these risks and informs the Board's determination to mitigate, avoid or eliminate such risks.
Environmental
While our portfolio companies take their environmental protection responsibilities seriously, the companies in which we invest that have a direct impact on the environment take great care both to be in full compliance with all applicable rules and regulations intended to protect the environment and to engage in series of voluntary efforts to help avoid harming the environment.

Social Matters
All of the companies in which we invest contribute to the communities in which they operate through employment and benefits practices aimed toward making the lives of our employees and their families better. Our investee companies also maintain rigorous policies and procedures aimed at ensuring that all employees of the Jefferies companies act with the highest integrity, always respecting each other, their clients, their customers and their counterparties.
In addition, our companies make the communities in which they operate better places. A few examples include:
At Jefferies Group, millions of dollars are donated each year to such causes as the Hurricane Harvey Disaster Relief Campaign, the Jefferies Family Scholarship Foundation, Jefferies Women's Initiative Network, charitable matching programs and the New York Common Pantry; in addition, Messrs. Handler and Friedman are active in philanthropy as described on pages 16 and 18

Outside Directorships
During our 2018 shareholder engagement, we again heard questions from some investors and proxy advisory firms regarding the time commitment of two of our executive directors who have other public company obligations. (Mr. Steinberg is on the boards of Spectrum Brands, HomeFed, and Crimson Wine in addition to being on our Board and that of Jefferies Group. Mr. Friedman holds two directorships, at HomeFed and Fiesta, in addition to being on our Board and that of Jefferies Group.) The answer to those questions remains simple: We have directed them to take on those positions to oversee our investments, and they are supported in those roles by our other employees. In each instance, except one, we have a significant investment in those companies: we own 100% of Jefferies Group; an approximately $374 million (14%) investment in Spectrum Brands; a $338 million (70%) investment in HomeFed; and a $71 million (14%) investment in Fiesta. (The one exception is Crimson Wine, which is a former portfolio investment of ours that was spun out to our shareholders six years ago and where Mr. Steinberg served as a director prior to the spin off.) We believe these directorships are crucial to our strategy and prospects and demonstrate smart and prudent oversight of our capital.
Director Independence
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, available on our website, Jefferies.com, our Board of Directors undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, our Board considered all transactions and relationships between us and each nominee for director or any member of such person's immediate family. The purpose of this review is to determine whether any relationship or transaction is considered a "material relationship" that would be inconsistent with a determination that a director is independent. Our Board has not adopted any "categorical standards" for assessing independence.
Our Board affirmatively determined that each of our non-employee director nominees is independent. In making this determination, our Board reviewed the corporate governance rules of the NYSE, the principal exchange on which our shares are traded, and considered commercial, charitable, family and other relationships that directors or members of their immediate family have or have had with us. In addition, for our Audit Committee members, our Board also considered the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
Table of Contents
Corporate Governance Matters
In particular, our Board considered the following relationships: Mr. Beyer is an independent director of Kroger, a company which has a commercial relationship with one of our subsidiaries; Mr. Reese previously served (prior to 2011) as President and Chief Executive Officer of MassMutual, a holder of our Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and a commercial finance joint venture partner with Jefferies Group; and Messrs. Joyal and Reese were associated with each other in connection with their prior employment with MassMutual. Additionally, our Board considered that certain Board members share directorships on unaffiliated, third-party boards.
Our Board has determined that these relationships are not material relationships and therefore do not affect our Board's determination of independence.
Executive Sessions
Our Board has determined that our independent directors will meet regularly in executive session outside the presence of management. No formal Board action may be taken at any executive session. Our Lead Director presides over each executive session and has the authority to call such meetings.
Directors and Board Committees
Our Board has standing Audit, Risk and Liquidity Oversight, Valuation Oversight, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, each of which has adopted a written charter that is available on our website at Jefferies.com.

 Mirrored Boards NEW         In the fourth quarter, the respective boards of Jefferies and Jefferies Group created mirrored boards – meaning the same individuals are on the Board of both Jefferies and Jefferies Group.

● Shareholders holding 3% of our outstanding shares for 3 years may nominate candidates● Shareholders can aggregate up to 20 holders to meet ownership requirement● Shareholders may nominate at least 2 candidates (or up to 20% of the size of our Board if greater)
  Individual Director Assessments     We enhanced our annual Board evaluation process to require individual director assessments. 
  Individual Director Assessments     We enhanced our annual Board evaluation process to require individual director assessments. 
 CEO and President Stock Ownership Guidelines     We adopted new ownership guidelines for our CEO and President which require each to accumulate an  ownership position in our equity securities with a value equal to at least 10-times the executive's salary.   
 Minimum Holding Periods of Vested Equity  We approved holding periods requiring our CEO and President to hold at least 75% of after-tax shares until the expiration of three years after vesting or until retirement (50% of after tax shares for all other named executive officers). 
 CEO and President Evaluations  We enhanced and formalized our Board's performance evaluation process for our CEO and President. 
 Corporate Social Responsibility Principles  We reconfirmed our commitment to social responsibility, charging management with implementing a process to evaluate our corporate conduct in light of our published principles. 
 Shareholder Engagement  We continued our rigorous shareholder outreach to better understand shareholder concerns and determine the best path to constructively respond to them. 
 Increased Director Stock Ownership Guidelines      We recently amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to require each director within five years of joining our Board to accumulate an ownership position in our equity securities with a value equal to five times the director's annual cash retainer (an increase from three times the director's annual cash retainer).

 Appointment of Lead Director          We created the position of Lead Director and amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to clearly delineate the Lead Director's responsibilities. 
 Majority Voting     We amended our by-laws to require majority voting in connection with uncontested director elections to work in conjunction with our previously-adopted director resignation policy. 
 Board Refreshment    We reconstituted our Board of Directors during 2013 and 2014, and again in 2018, ultimately increasing the number of seats from eight to 12, with a total of 10 new directors since March 2013, 9 of whom are independent.

 Clawback Policy    We approved a policy allowing our Compensation Committee to claw back performance-based and discretionary awards if an underlying performance metric considered by the Compensation Committee in approving an award is corrected, adjusted or deemed to be false. 
 Prohibition on Hedging  We imposed a prohibition on the hedging of our shares and other securities by our directors, executives and employees. 
 Independent Compensation Consultant  Our Compensation Committee retained Mercer (US) Inc. as its independent compensation consultant to review our historical compensation and related practices, examine relevant peer and industry practices and advise the Compensation Committee on how best to structure our performance-based and other compensation programs going forward. 
[END TABLE]
Additional information about changes to our compensation policies and practices is contained in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement.
Majority Voting and Director Resignation Policy
Our by-laws require that each director in an uncontested election be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director. We previously adopted a director resignation policy, which is incorporated into our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Pursuant to this policy, in an uncontested election of directors, any incumbent director nominee who does not receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required to promptly tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors. A director nominee will have failed to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast if the number of "against" votes in respect of such director nominee's election exceeds the number of votes "for" such director nominee's election (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). An election is considered "uncontested" if the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected.
Our Board of Directors will decide, after considering the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, whether to accept or reject a tendered resignation. The nominee in question will not participate in the recommendation or decision-making process. Our Board's explanation of its decision will be publicly disclosed within 90 days from the date of publication of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Board of Directors may consider any factor deemed appropriate during this process.
Anti-Hedging Policy
Our Insider Trading and Anti-Tipping Policy expressly prohibits hedging transactions involving our securities and those of our subsidiaries by our directors, executive officers and all other employees. We believe that hedging against losses in our securities breaks the alignment between our shareholders and our executives that equity grants are intended to build. Our anti-hedging policy also prohibits direct and indirect short selling and derivative transactions involving our securities, other than the exercise of any options or warrants issued by us to our employees or directors.
Related Person Policy and Transactions
Our Board has adopted a written policy for the review, approval and ratification of transactions that involve related persons and potential conflicts of interest. Our Related Person Transaction Policy applies to the following Related Persons: each of our directors and executive officers, any security holder who is known to own more than five percent of our shares, any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, any entity of which one of our directors is a director or officer (other than when serving at our request), and any entity of which one of our directors has a substantial financial interest (other than through us).

Under our Related Person Transaction Policy, a covered transaction includes a transaction or arrangement involving a Related Person in which we are a participant or that would require disclosure in our filings with the SEC as a transaction with a Related Person.
Under our Related Person Transaction Policy, Related Persons must disclose to the Audit Committee any potential covered transaction and must disclose all material facts with respect to such interest. All covered transactions will be reviewed by the Audit Committee and, in its discretion, approved or ratified. In determining whether to approve or ratify such a transaction, the Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances which may include factors such as the relationship of the Related Person with us, the materiality or significance of the transaction to us and the Related Person, the business purpose and reasonableness of the transaction, whether the transaction is comparable to a transaction that could be available to us on an arms-length basis and the impact of the transaction on our business and operation.
Mr. Steinberg's brother, Morton M. Steinberg, is a retired senior counsel in the law firm DLA Piper LLP (US). Morton Steinberg did not have an ownership interest in DLA Piper. During fiscal 2018, we paid approximately $191,300 to DLA Piper for legal services rendered to us. This amount represents less than .001% of all fees received by DLA Piper in 2018.
We carry term life insurance on Mr. Steinberg in the amount of $1,000,000 payable to his designated beneficiaries. We paid $12,178 for such policy in fiscal 2018.
Prior to the combination of Jefferies and Jefferies Group in 2013, Jefferies Group invested in three private equity funds managed by companies controlled by Mr. Friedman, and acquired interests in the profit participation earned by two management companies that manage these three funds. These two management companies (Fund Managers) serve as the managers of the three private equity funds (Private Equity Funds) and have varying profit participations and other interests in those funds. Mr. Friedman founded the business of the Fund Managers in 1994 before he became associated with Jefferies Group; and, the Board of Jefferies Group approved these arrangements years prior to consummation of our transaction with Jefferies.
As of November 30, 2018, Jefferies Group had committed an aggregate of approximately $146.8 million to the Private Equity Funds and had funded approximately $128.2 million of these commitments. As of November 30, 2018, Jefferies Group had committed an aggregate of $9.8 million to a Fund Manager, out of which approximately $5.8 million was funded and $3.4 million was terminated as of November 30, 2018. As a result of those investments, commitments and profit participations, Jefferies Group received distributions from the Private Equity Funds and Fund Managers in fiscal year 2018 of approximately $0.4 million.
As of November 30, 2018, one of the Private Equity Funds has sold its last investment and is in dissolution. Included in the $841 million in total equity committed to the two remaining Private Equity Funds over which Mr. Friedman has control are individual investments of certain of our named executive officers. As a result of their individual commitments, as of November 30, 2018, Mr. Handler had an aggregate invested interest in the total committed capital in these two Private Equity Funds of 0.2% and Mr. Friedman had an aggregate invested interest of 7.9%. In addition, Mr. Friedman has a substantial economic interest in the Fund Managers and, directly and indirectly, in the carried interest paid by the Private Equity Funds.
We employ certain former employees of the Fund Managers who continue to partially work for the Fund Managers under an arrangement Jefferies originally entered into with Mr. Friedman and a Fund Manager in 2005 and a related agreement we entered into during 2014. In fiscal year 2018, the Fund Manager paid us approximately $0.9 million for the direct and indirect costs attributed to employees' work performed for the Fund Managers.
We have employed Thomas E. Tarrant, the brother-in-law of our Chief Executive Officer, as Jefferies Group's Head of Marketing since 1997, three years before Mr. Handler was appointed CEO of Jefferies Group. For his services during Jefferies Group's fiscal year 2018, Mr. Tarrant was paid $290,000.
We allow our executives and directors to invest in funds managed by us on the same terms offered to other investors. At November 30, 2018, Messrs. Friedman, Steinberg and Handler had interests worth to approximately $9.3 million, $0.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in such funds.
The foregoing arrangements have been approved by our Board and applicable Committees in accordance with our related person transaction policy.

Engagement of Independent Compensation Consultant
During 2018, our Compensation Committee retained Mercer (US) Inc. as an independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee with conducting a thorough review of our executive compensation practices, including a review of our historical compensation and related practices, an examination of relevant peer and industry practices and recommendations on how best to structure our performance-based and other compensation practices going forward.
Our Compensation Committee considered whether any conflicts of interest would arise due to its engagement of Mercer. During 2017, we paid Mercer $163,000 for executive and director compensation consulting services and paid Mercer and its affiliates $603,000 for other services. The decisions to use Mercer and its affiliates for these other services are made in the ordinary course of our business and are generally recommended by our business department heads with the approval of management. We view these engagements as unrelated to our Compensation Committee's engagement of Mercer and we do not require the Compensation Committee or our Board to review each use of Mercer or its affiliates for such purposes. The Compensation Committee also considered that the Mercer consultants providing services to the Compensation Committee do not benefit economically from the provision of the non-executive compensation services and work in a different office separate from the part of Mercer that provides the other services. The Compensation Committee reviewed and analyzed Mercer's services to and compensation from us prior to its engagement and all other factors deemed relevant and required by SEC rules and concluded that the proposed engagement of Mercer by our Compensation Committee for executive compensation work did not raise a conflict of interest and that Mercer remained independent.
Director Stock Ownership
Our Board believes our directors should also be shareholders. During 2018, our Corporate Governance Guidelines were amended to increase our director stock ownership guideline and now requires each director within five years of joining our Board to accumulate an ownership position in our equity securities equal to five times the value of a director's annual cash retainer (currently a requirement to hold not less than $575,000 worth of our shares).

During 2018, we issued a total of 5,154,793 shares under our existing equity plans, representing a rate of equity award grants, or so-called burn rate, of 1.6% of our average outstanding shares, which our Compensation Committee believes is modest for a company of our size and scope of operations, particularly since the bulk of this is three-year grants and we expect nominal issuance in 2019 and 2020.

Proposal II  Advisory Vote on 2018 Executive Compensation  
    The Board recommends a vote FOR the approval of Executive Officer Compensation 
[END TABLE]
We provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the advisory vote relates to the overall compensation of our executive officers. We value this vote as important feedback from our shareholders. Our next compensation advisory vote will occur in 2020 as our practice is to present this vote to our shareholders annually.
We believe that there should be a strong link between executive compensation and our performance and the performance of our named executive officers. This Proxy Statement contains a detailed description of the 2018, 2019 and 2020 compensation of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee and our Board of Directors believe that the policies and procedures articulated are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our named executive officers reported in this Proxy Statement will contribute to our long-term success.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure is approved.
The function of the Compensation Committee is to advise senior management on the administration of our compensation programs and plans, review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our other executive officers, evaluate the performance of the executive officers in light of those goals and objectives, set the executive officers' compensation levels based on this evaluation and assist our principal executive officers in formulating compensation programs applicable to our senior management.
Our Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with our management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. Based upon the reviews and discussions, we have recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) outlines how we, the Compensation Committee, determine how to set executive compensation for our executive officers. For the past few years, we have crafted an executive compensation plan that we believed was both fair to our executives and served the long-term interests of you, our fellow shareholders. Indeed, as we discussed in last year's CD&A and as our whole Board noted in its letter to shareholders in last year's Proxy Statement:
In early 2018, we were highly confident that our 2017 executive compensation plan, which – as noted above – was the exact same plan as the 2016 plan on which we achieved a nearly 90% favorable rating, would meet or exceed that 90% favorable rating. We were wrong. A majority of our voting shares did vote in favor of the 2017 plan, but well below the almost 90% rate we garnered in 2017.
We have expended considerable efforts since our May 2018 annual meeting to engage with those shareholders who voted against our 2017 plan and with the two well-respected proxy advisory firms that advised voting against our executive compensation plans to determine those factors that drove those negative votes and recommendations.
Before getting to a discussion of the results of those efforts, though, we want to express our most sincere thanks to both shareholders and ISS and Glass Lewis for taking the time to meet with our Compensation Committee Chairman and General Counsel. Between May and October, we conferred both with holders of a majority of our shares who voted against our plan and with the proxy advisory firms. Once we reformulated our plan based on those discussions, which we will address later in this CD&A, we then re-engaged with holders of a majority of our shares (regardless of how they previously voted) and, again, with the proxy advisory firms. We are deeply grateful to all of you who provided frank and constructive feedback that has resulted in amended executive compensation plans that we believe are in line with our shareholders' expressed wishes.
We will discuss each of these factors later in this CD&A, but the summary table below outlines the specific issues that we heard from our shareholders and from the proxy advisory firms and a brief description of how we have amended our executive compensation plan to address those issues.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Banking: We uniformly heard displeasure with our banking mechanism, under which executives could earn banked but unvested RSUs for each individual performance year even if performance for subsequent years is below expectations.  We eliminated banking 
 Absolute TSR Measurement: Shareholders and proxy advisory firms favored some element of relative total shareholder return instead of an exclusive, absolute TSR performance measurement.  We implemented a relative TSR performance threshold starting in the current year 
 Insufficient Articulation of Peer Selection Process: Certain shareholders and the proxy advisory firms asked us to review and amend our peer list and to explain in greater detail why we selected the peers that we did.  We reshaped and expanded our peer list and provided a more fulsome articulation of our peer-selection reasoning 
 Performance Targets: Certain shareholders expressed an issue with our targeted performance metrics for ROTDE and TSR.  We raised our performance ranges from a 5% threshold and 8% target for each of ROTDE and TSR to a 6% threshold and 9% target; the higher performance target reduces overall award magnitude at the former 8% target by nearly 17% 
 Magnitude of the Overall Award: Certain shareholders believed that the overall magnitude of our executive compensation package was too high.  We reduced the targeted cash portion of our compensation plan by 28% and the overall targeted compensation by 10% 
 What We Heard  What We Committed 
 No Increases to Equity. We heard concern that, because we employed a one-time equity grant for the 2018 Plan, 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan, the equity portions of those plans could be increased at a later time.  We confirmed and committed that no additional equity would be granted under those Plans 
 Exercise of Negative Discretion. We heard questions whether we could employ negative discretion as it pertained to the equity portion of the 2018 Plan, 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan.  We confirmed that we retain negative discretion and that no positive discretion is allowed; that is, we may reduce equity awards, but will not increase them 
[END TABLE]
The changes discussed later in this CD&A are meaningful amendments to the executive compensation plans that we approved on January 1, 2018 in direct response to our shareholders' feedback. It bears noting that, although these substantial amendments make it more difficult for our two top executives to achieve targeted compensation that has been reduced by 10%, our CEO and President – who are also two of our largest individual shareholders – have, fully supported our changes.
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Although we have amended our go-forward compensation plans to respond to our fellow shareholders' concerns, we have done so in a manner that reflects our ongoing commitment to maintaining a long-term view of our business goals aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of impatience and short-term investment horizons. Our CEO and President, who together own approximately 7.6% of our outstanding shares, are both financially and strategically aligned with all of us and you as our shareholders. Our intention is to buttress that long-term fellow-shareholder alignment with compensation plans geared toward further maximizing our long-term growth.
In doing so, we also strive to weigh carefully the possible consequences of our executive compensation plan. That is to say, we want to ensure that our changes do not unduly alter the risk appetite of our executives. We want to be certain that they will continue to strike the proper balance between short-term performance and our ultimate objective: long-term value creation. We aim, as we always have, for long-termism. We believe the program we are proposing supports our objectives.
As we consider how to compensate our top executives, we are also ever-mindful of how our CEO and President have been uniquely integral over a span counted in decades to leading, first, Jefferies Group and then Leucadia to where we are today, as well as having our complete confidence as our leaders moving forward. Rich and Brian are two of the most dedicated and passionate leaders in our or any other industry. And they are, without question, the most loyal.
Although that dedication, passion and loyalty make us secure that they will be with us for the long haul, we want to reward those characteristics and not to take advantage of them. That is to say, were our top executives either front-line producers at Jefferies or a competitor or lured to a mergers and acquisition boutique, a private equity firm or a hedge fund, our research demonstrates that they would be compensated more favorably than they are compensated by us. Thus, a material driver of our compensation philosophy is both fair reward and retention.
Our goal is to find the best way to retain and motivate our executives while taking into account the views of you, our fellow shareholders, as well as our responsibilities as stewards of Jefferies.
Our philosophy was, is and will remain simple: We want to pay our executives fairly relative to our performance as compared with their peers, but only if they generate meaningful long-term growth in our value.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Committee's Role
As a guiding mandate, our goal is to implement an executive compensation plan that reflects our shareholders' desires and adheres to industry best practices.
We structure and administer our executive compensation plans to accomplish these goals. This administration has evolved into a year-long process that, this year, began soon after we filed last year's Proxy Statement. At that time, our Committee Chair with assistance from our General Counsel began engaging with the proxy advisory firms and shareholders who, respectively, recommended and voted against our 2017 executive compensation plan. After receiving that feedback during the fall and into the end of our fiscal year we conferred among ourselves, with our executives and with our external advisors to review shareholder feedback and to determine how to amend our plan. Prior to adopting any of those amendments, we again reached out to and engaged with investors holding nearly 70% of our shares to preview our amendments and to solicit additional feedback to be sure we were heading in the direction desired by our fellow shareholders. Then, we formally amended the program. And, once this Proxy Statement is filed, we will again and as needed engage further with our fellow shareholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Among the many amendments we implemented to our compensation program, the most recent and one of the more meaningful ones resulted from our engagement with fellow shareholders and the proxy advisors over the past six weeks. We had already decided to implement a relative TSR modifier, but when previewing a possible cut-in level of the 25th percentile against our peers, you made clear to us that, if we were going to pay above target, you expected us to do so only if our relative performance was at or above the median of our peers. You voiced a strong opinion. We listened. The cut-in is now at the median (see pages 50 and 52).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with our CEO and President, also determines the compensation of our other executive officers. The Committee considered the views of Messrs. Handler and Friedman, including their assessments of our executives' individual performance, and the range of market inputs available, in setting their compensation.
Role of the Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee retained Mercer (US) Inc. as an independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee with conducting a thorough review of our executive compensation practices, including a review of our historical compensation and related practices, an examination of relevant peer and industry practices and recommendations on how best to address compensation matters going forward. As is historically the case, for our 2018 compensation program Mercer was tasked with assisting the Compensation Committee with:
The Compensation Committee and its advisers also discussed with Mercer Rich and Brian's unique player/coach roles to aid in assessing comparable compensation not only as our senior leaders in their roles as CEO and President, but also as two of our most productive front-line deal makers, traders, and investors. When considering these two top executives, who have worked highly successfully as a team for almost eighteen years, the Compensation Committee took into account the following:
Peer Selection
We and our compensation consultant analyzed comparable peer compensation as a general frame of reference for considering the appropriateness of our executive compensation programs and to ensure our CEO and President are appropriately aligned with peers.
Spurred by shareholder feedback that specifically touched on our peer-group selection process, this year we carefully re-examined our historical peer group, which resulted in dropping two names from our historical list and adding four more. Assisted by Mercer, we sought to identify carefully those companies by using the following criteria:

 2018 - 2020 Executive Compensation Plans 
[END TABLE]
Our Original Plan
As was the case with our 2016 Plan and 2017 Plan, our adoption of the 2018 Plan, the 2019 Plan and the 2020 Plan was firmly anchored to reward how our executives performed – in particular, to how our executives were able to drive total shareholder return and return on tangible deployable equity:
As we discussed with a majority of you prior to our adopting the three-year program in January 2018, our goal was to lock in place a long-term incentive program that, with the exception of base salaries, demanded that our executives consistently generate long-term ROTDE and TSR. Unlike for our 2016 and 2017 plans, which contained no cash incentive other than base salaries, our 2018 Plan, 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan originally had a targeted long-term cash component of $9 million that would have to be earned over a three-year measurement period and could only be earned if compounded annual ROTDE was equal to or greater than 8%. Those Plans also had a targeted long-term equity component of $16 million that would have to be earned over a three-year measurement period and could only be earned if compounded annual TSR was equal to or greater than 8%.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
As noted, our original goal — with the exception of adding a cash component — was to replicate in 2018, 2019 and 2020 the compensation plans we had in place for 2016 and 2017.
One-Time Grant
It is very important to note as we discuss our original plans that we intended those plans to apply to three distinct compensation years to underscore our unwavering desire to maintain compensation plans that, despite the change in the tax laws, still require multi-year compounded performance measured by ROTDE and TSR, are fully aligned with our long-term value creation strategy and insulate us from the time-generated creep of compensation growth that we see in some of our competitors.
Thus, in early 2018 we awarded our executives performance-based RSUs with a targeted notional amount of $48 million based on a share price of $26.49 per share but with the express intent that the RSU grant would be allocated equally to compensation years 2018, 2019 and 2020. And for each of those three compensation years, our executives would have to overcome the same hurdles to earn their pay:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Generate compounded annual TSR over a three-year period and bear the risk that, without such performance, they will forfeit their entire equity incentive compensation. 
● Face a three-year cliff vesting schedule for each compensation year, which means that the 2018 portion of the grant does not vest, presuming that performance warrants the receipt of RSUs, until 2021; the 2019 portion does not vest until 2022; and the 2020 portion does not vest until 2023. That is to say, the entire program has as long as a five-year vesting period on the original grant. 
● Bear the risk that – as was the case this year – their significant operating success would not be reflected in absolute TSR, which means, using 2018 as an example, that the notional value of the 2018 portion of the one-time grant has declined in value by 85% from $16 million to approximately $2.46 million. Of course, such negative TSR performance also means the likelihood of ever getting any equity compensation is greatly reduced. 
[END TABLE]
We raise this here because, as we have engaged with shareholders and the advisory firms recently, some thought that there was a three-year vesting period on the entire grant. That is not the case. In addition, some questioned whether we retained discretion to reduce the number of shares or were considering granting more shares. As we made plain during our engagement and as is shown on pages 39 and 47, we absolutely retain negative discretion and we have committed not to supplement the 2018 one-time RSU grant.
One final note. It bears repeating that, although our Summary Compensation Table is fully compliant with SEC rules and displays the total grant date fair value of the target shares awarded in the year 2018 as part of a program that applies to three compensation years (2018, 2019 and 2020), the Compensation Committee's intent and the underlying fact of the matter is that our executives most definitely did not receive $38.7 million worth of Jefferies equity as compensation for fiscal year 2018.
The Results of our Original 2018 Plan
From any objective measure, our compensation plan has worked as designed and intended. Our executives have generated an impressive ROTDE of 15.2% and been rewarded in receiving the maximum payout on the cash component of one year's worth of the 2018 Plan's three-year measurement period. Despite that mid-teens ROTDE, though, their cash compensation did not reflect any performance windfall because we capped compensation on any performance over 12%.
Notwithstanding that impressive 15.2% ROTDE, we suffered a share-price drop along with all our peers and experienced a 15.8% decline in TSR. Accordingly, for compensation year 2018 our executives earned $4.5 million in a cash incentive, but received no credit for the 2018 portion of their long-term equity compensation. Put differently, because we failed to meet threshold absolute TSR on the equity portion of the award and because the performance award of the ROTDE is capped at 12%, instead of being on track in year one of three to meet at least target compensation (approximately 33%), our executives have so far received only 18% of targeted compensation.

Our Amendments to the 2018 Plan NEW
Following the results of last year's say-on-pay vote and the direct feedback we received from our shareholders, our initial thought was essentially to start from scratch, do away with this three-year program, and to build from the ground up. The significant issue we encountered, however, was that, had we followed that path – that is to say, had we scrapped the three-year performance-based stock program and implemented a series of new one-year equity plans for each of compensation years

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
2018, 2019 and 2020 – we would have been forced to fully expense the initial 2018 - 2020 equity portions of the program and then to take, depending on the nature of what we did, as much as double expenses for any particular year as we would have had to expense each new plan. For example, had we scrapped the 2018 - 2020 equity portions of the plans adopted last year and implemented only a new 2018 plan now and then implemented a new plan in the beginning of 2019 and then, again, in the beginning of 2020, under GAAP we would have had to "double expense" the original 2018 – 2020 equity portions of the plans plus the grant date fair value of the new replacement equity awards in 2019 and 2020.
Likewise, had we reduced the equity portions of our executive compensation plans in order to lower the overall magnitude of the plans, under GAAP we would have had to still expense the entire original January 2018 grant date fair value amount despite the reduction. Needless to say, we rejected those ideas and adopted a more effective approach, including raising our performance targets, that would amend our program as our shareholders wanted us to do without unnecessarily impairing our bottom line.
Against that backdrop, including in particular that one out of the three performance years for the 2018 Plan was already recorded on the books, we considered how to amend the 2018 Plan to address the issues raised by our fellow shareholders. Based on those considerations, we did the following:
And, as noted above, unless there is at least a 29.2% compounded growth in TSR between now and the end of fiscal year 2020, the entire equity component of the 2018 Plan, which represents about two-thirds of the targeted compensation, will be eradicated. In light of those considerations, the 2018 Plan does not feature relative TSR because its modifying potential would have been irrelevant.
With the increased 6% threshold rate and 9% target rate for compounded annual TSR and ROTDE, we are confident that these rates constitute rigorous performance targets that would, in both the short- and long-term on a compounded basis generate not only significant growth in tangible equity but, ultimately, substantial growth in TSR.

Our Amendments to Our 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan
Compensation for 2019 and 2020 is where we were able to make more meaningful modifications. As discussed on page 39 of this CD&A, we have responded to our shareholders' concerns and made substantial amendments to our 2019 Plan and 2020 Plan, as noted below.
BANKING 
Pro rata portions of the overall awards were allowed to be banked after the first and second years.

ABSOLUTE TSR MEASUREMENT
Absolute TSR measurement was employed rather than relative targets, first, to align more closely to the creation of absolute intrinsic value over time and, second, because of the unique and varied components and earnings of Jefferies Financial Group that make it difficult to find a precise comparator.

While our objective is to set target compensation at or near our peer median, our disclosed pay (because of regulatory requirements) as well as our actual pay (based on results or estimated valuation) can deviate from that objective as indicated below:
COMPENSATION COMPARISON VERSUS CURRENT PEERS
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our compensation policies are designed to provide competitive levels of compensation in order to attract and retain talented executives and leaders, encourage long-term service and loyalty and align their interests with the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. Each element of our program, base salary, annual incentive, long-term incentive and benefits, is tailored to incentivize a specific area of pay that we believe will promote sustained economic value over time. 
[END TABLE]
Alignment between Pay and Performance
The changes we have made over the last several years have resulted in closely aligned pay and performance, and completely transparent elements of our program. In 2018, 96% of our CEO and President's total target compensation was at risk and approximately 64% of all other NEOs' target compensation was at risk. Equity is a significant component of this compensation, and, as we continue to believe and state, provides strong incentives for superior long-term performance and a direct link to the interests of our shareholders.

AT-RISK COMPENSATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO AND PRESIDENT          ALL OTHER NEOs 
[END TABLE]
We pay our named executive officers a base salary to provide them a predictable level of income and to reward current and past short-term performance. The base salaries we have established reflect our understanding of the competitive market for these roles. The base salaries below are annualized.
Annual Bonuses
Annual bonuses are designed to encourage our executive officers to deliver strong annual results, to maximize short-term productivity and profitability and to reward our executive officers for their efforts during the year. Motivating our executive officers to deliver strong short-term results directly impacts our performance, and together with long-term focus and risk mitigation, is key to our success.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO and President        Given the long-term focus of their compensation plan, our top two executives, Rich Handler (CEO) and Brian Friedman (President), were eligible to receive 100% performance-based bonuses in 2018, composed of long-term, performance-based cash and long-term, performance-based equity. 
 Chairman   At our request, our Chairman serves as a director of some of our portfolio companies. Our portfolio companies benefit from Mr. Steinberg's investment acumen, years of business experience and his hands-on involvement. Mr. Steinberg serves as Chairman of the Board of HomeFed and is a director of Spectrum Brands. Mr. Steinberg also serves on the Jefferies Group Board. Much of Mr. Steinberg's time is spent assisting our portfolio companies in these capacities. Like his fellow non-employee directors, Mr. Steinberg receives board retainer fees and equity awards in consideration of director services. During 2018, Mr. Steinberg received $310,954 in cash and equity payments as director compensation from our portfolio companies. Our Compensation Committee approved his retaining these amounts and recognized them as constituting his annual incentive bonus. 
 General Counsel   Our General Counsel's annual incentive compensation was based on a combination of a performance-based bonus and a discretionary bonus. To align his compensation with the performance metrics driving our two top executives, Mr. Sharp's targeted performance-based incentive compensation was targeted at 40% of his 2017 bonus if ROTDE were at 8%, with the potential to get up to 60% of his 2017 bonus if ROTDE were to be greater than or equal to 12%. Mr. Sharp's discretionary incentive was to be targeted at 50% of his 2017 bonus and based on the Company's performance, personal performance, effectiveness of non-revenue-generating activities, implementation of strategic initiatives, and overall senior management skill and effectiveness. With our fiscal 2018 ROTDE at 15.2%, the calculated performance portion of Mr. Sharp's incentive compensation equaled $2,400,000. The Compensation Committee, with input from Messrs. Handler and Friedman, awarded Mr. Sharp that amount plus a discretionary bonus of $1,100,000 based on a variety of factors, including Jefferies Financial Group and Jefferies Group's performance, particularly the latter's performance in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Handler and Friedman, awarded Ms. Gendron a discretionary bonus of $460,000, resulting in the same aggregate bonus as the previous year which was deemed to be appropriate given Jefferies Financial Group's performance and her role and responsibilities.

Long-term equity and cash incentive compensation provides strong incentives for superior long-term performance and a direct link for our executive officers to the interests of our shareholders. The value of long-term equity incentive awards increase or decrease based on the future price of our shares. Awards of long-term equity incentive compensation also create long-term ownership, which we believe is important to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO and President        Our Compensation Committee approved an executive compensation program for our CEO and President consisting of long-term, performance-based cash and long-term, performance-based equity for each of compensation years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on shareholder feedback, our Compensation Committee amended that program and amended the plans for each of compensation years 2018, 2019, and 2020 as described in detail above. 
[END TABLE]
Benefits
We provide our named executive officers with medical, dental, life insurance, disability, savings, retirement, deferred compensation opportunities and other similar benefits available to employees generally that are not part of what we consider direct compensation. We intend these benefits to be competitive in order to help recruit and retain talented executives. These benefits are designed to facilitate the productivity of our executives, ensure the well-being of our executives, employees and their families, encourage long-term service to us and generally enable our compensation packages to remain competitive. In the aggregate, we believe our benefits including perquisites are in-line with or more moderate than general business practices for companies of comparable size and character.
Executive Perquisites
Certain perquisites as disclosed in our Summary Compensation Table are available to executive officers that are not available to other employees. Messrs. Handler, Friedman and Steinberg may use our business aircraft for personal use to assure their constant availability and responsiveness and to facilitate their productivity, subject to an annual $350,000 limitation for each executive, above which reimbursement to us is required. Certain of our executive officers receive the use of chauffeured cars, paid parking, and vehicle-related expenses for business as well as personal use also to assure their constant availability and responsiveness, and to facilitate their productivity. These benefits also allow us to be competitive in the talent market. These perquisites are reported as All Other Compensation in our Summary Compensation Table.
Severance
Under our severance policy, employees terminated by us other than for cause are generally entitled to one month's pay for each year of service, up to a maximum of 24 months. Pay is defined as salary plus bonus (excluding one-time, tenure or holiday bonus). Messrs. Handler, Friedman and Sharp are only entitled to severance under Jefferies Group's policy, which provides that terminated employees, other than employees terminated for cause, are generally entitled to one-half month's salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of six months (a maximum of 12 months for employees with age plus years of service of at least 60). More information is provided under Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change-in-Control.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Retirement and Deferral Plans
For Jefferies Financial Group employees hired before January 2014, we maintain a Savings and Retirement Plan that allows participants to make contributions, portions of which are matched by us. The plan also provides a contribution for eligible participants determined on the basis of age and service with potential contributions ranging from 2% of eligible compensation up to 16% of eligible compensation.
Our deferred compensation retirement plan allows employees with compensation in excess of $130,000 the opportunity to receive an employer contribution ranging from 2% of eligible compensation up to 16% of eligible compensation. The plan does not provide for employee contributions. We also have a deferred compensation plan that permits the deferral of compensation and provides a means for our employees to invest in our shares on a tax-deferred basis. These plans are designed as non-qualified deferred compensation plans and are intended to meet the requirements of Section 409A.
Employees of Jefferies Group who began service prior to April 1, 1997, which includes Mr. Handler but none of the other named executive officers, are entitled to benefits under the Jefferies Group pension plan.
Employment Agreements
We do not have any employment agreements with our named executive officers.
Change-in-Control Agreements
We do not have any change-in-control agreements with any named executive officers. No equity held by our executive officers is subject to accelerated vesting upon a change-in-control.
Newly Established Stock Ownership Guidelines
We recently adopted stock ownership guidelines for our CEO and President. The guideline is set at 10-times salary, resulting in a requirement that each executive hold $10 million worth of our shares. Messrs. Handler and Friedman have historically acquired and held large positions in our shares. Including all earned and unearned deferred shares, Messrs. Handler and Friedman own a combined 24,592,145 shares, representing approximately 7.6% of our outstanding shares.
Since becoming CEO of Jefferies Group in 2001 and throughout his entire career as CEO of Jefferies Group and Jefferies Financial Group, over 75% of Mr. Handler's compensation has consisted of non-cash equity related securities vesting over three to five years. Aside from charitable donations and tax-related sales, Mr. Handler has not sold any of his shares.
Since becoming an executive officer of Jefferies Group in 2005 and as President of Jefferies Financial Group, over 91% of Mr. Friedman's compensation from Jefferies has consisted of non-cash equity related securities vesting over three to five years. Aside from charitable donations and tax-related sales, Mr. Friedman has not sold any of his shares.
In addition, Mr. Steinberg owns 21,470,733 shares, representing 7.1% of our outstanding shares.
This ownership encourages our executives to act in our best long-term interests and those of our shareholders.
Clawback Policy
We have adopted a policy allowing our Compensation Committee to claw back performance-based and discretionary awards if the underlying performance metric, or a performance metric considered by the Compensation Committee in approving an award, is corrected, adjusted or deemed to be false. This policy applies to all of our executive officers.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Anti-Hedging Policies
Directors, executive officers and other employees are expressly prohibited from hedging transactions that involve our securities and those of our subsidiaries under our amended Insider Trading and Anti-Tipping Policy. Our anti-hedging policy also prohibits direct and indirect short selling, option transactions of any kind and derivative transactions that involve our securities. The policy does not apply to the exercise of options, warrants or other rights issued by us or any transaction approved in advance by the Compensation Committee. We currently have no outstanding options or warrants issued by us and our Compensation Committee has never been asked to, nor ever approved, any exceptions to our anti-hedging policies.
Compensation Risk Management
Our Compensation Committee has considered whether our compensation policies and practices reward employees for imprudent risk taking and has determined that our compensation policies and practices, including those of Jefferies Group, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The Compensation Committee's assessment is conducted annually. Management reviews with our Compensation Committee our compensation programs, focusing on incentive programs, risks and mitigation factors. Based on the totality of this information, the Compensation Committee determines whether any portion of such compensation encourages excessive risk taking and concludes whether or not our compensation programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.
In assessing risks, our Compensation Committee considers mitigating factors such as (i) the multiple elements of our compensation packages, including base salary and bonuses, either in the form of restricted cash or equity awards, both of which vest over a number of years; (ii) the structure of senior executives' incentive program, which is based on a number of different performance measures to avoid placing undue emphasis on any particular performance metric; (iii) the ability to exercise negative discretion as a means to adjust compensation downward to reflect performance or other factors; (iv) oversight of our programs by our Board and Compensation Committee; (v) our clawback policy; (vi) our anti-hedging policy; (vii) no change-in-control benefits and (viii) other factors deemed relevant by the Committee.
As discussed earlier, we specifically considered whether our amended compensation program might inappropriately increase the risk appetite of our executives. We did not want our amendments to upset the proper balance between short-term performance and our ultimate objective: long-term value creation. We believe the program we are proposing supports our long-term objectives.
Tax Considerations
Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act removed the tax incentive for qualified performance-based compensation beginning in 2018, our Compensation Committee retained the use of performance-based compensation for our executives for compensation year 2018 as an appropriate and valuable tool to continue to align our executives' interests with the long-term interests of our shareholders.

Jefferies Group first adopted its pension plan in 1964 and stopped admitting new participants into the plan on April 1, 1997. Effective December 31, 2005, benefits under the plan were frozen. All persons who were Jefferies Group employees prior to April 1, 1997, who are citizens or residents of the United States, who are 21 years of age and who have completed one year of service are covered by the pension plan. The plan is a defined benefit plan funded through our ongoing contributions and through earnings on existing plan assets. The amount an employee will receive as a plan benefit depends on the person's covered compensation during specific plan years. An employee retiring at age 65 will receive 1% of the employee's covered compensation from January 1, 1987, until termination of employment plus 20% of the first $4,800 and 50% of amounts exceeding $4,800 of annual average covered compensation for 1985 and 1986. Benefits under the plan are payable for the remaining life of the participant and are not subject to deduction for Social Security benefits or other offsets.
Since 2004, the amount of covered compensation has been capped at $210,000 per year. An employee who retires upon normal retirement at age 65 with at least four years of service will receive a full vested benefit. An employee who retires at age 55 with at least four years of service will receive the normal retirement benefit reduced by 1/2% for each month benefit payments commence before age 65. Employees who terminate employment for reasons other than death or retirement will be entitled to the vested portion of their benefits at their normal or early retirement age. Benefits vest at the rate of 0% for the first year of service, 33% for each of the next two years of service and 34% for the fourth year of service. The retirement benefits payable at age 65 for those employees with service prior to January 1, 1987, will be composed of two items: (1) a benefit for service up to December 31, 1986, in accordance with the original plan formula recognizing pay up to $100,000 and (2) a benefit for service commencing on January 1, 1987, equal to 1% of covered compensation through the date of termination.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The following table shows the benefits that the named executive officers are entitled to receive under our Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Retirement Plan established January 1, 2009, our 2003 Incentive Plan, amended and restated on July 25, 2013 and Mr. Handler's self-directed deferred compensation account which was in place before he became CEO of Jefferies Group in 2001.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The following information describes and quantifies (where possible) certain compensation that would become payable under then-existing agreements and plans if the named executive officer's employment had terminated on November 30, 2018, other than voluntary resignations or termination for cause.
Named Executive Officer Termination Payments
Severance Payments
Messrs. Handler, Friedman and Sharp are subject to the same severance policy as all other Jefferies Group employees: 
Mr. Steinberg and Ms. Gendron are subject to the same severance policy as all other Jefferies employees: 
Individual Deferred Compensation Plan
Mr. Handler is a beneficiary of an individual deferred compensation plan established prior to 2001 (with his last contribution relating to compensation for fiscal year 2000). The deferred compensation was earned while Mr. Handler was head of Jefferies Group's high yield division, before Jefferies Group implemented its generally applicable deferred compensation plan and prior to Mr. Handler becoming an executive officer of Jefferies Group. The balance in this plan represents compensation from 2000 and prior years as well as the earnings on those deferred amounts. Amounts deferred under Mr. Handler's individual deferred compensation plan are non-forfeitable, and the occurrence of a change-in-control or a termination in connection with a change-in-control would not cause a payment or enhancement in the value of his deferral account. Mr. Handler's deferrals under this plan will be settled upon his termination of employment (subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code).
Summary of Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control
The table below shows the estimated value of payments to which a named executive officer would have been entitled if the executive's employment had been terminated on November 30, 2018. For purposes of valuing these amounts, we made the following assumptions:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
CEO Pay Ratio Information
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Richard Handler, our Chief Executive Officer.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used were as follows.
We determined that, as of October 1, 2018, our employee population (other than our CEO) consisted of approximately 4,643 individuals working for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including all U.S. employees and non-U.S. employees and all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers, including Jefferies Financial Group, Jefferies Group, Folger Hill, Leucadia Asset Management, M Science, Idaho Timber, Foursight and Vitesse (but excluding National Beef because it was no longer a consolidated subsidiary). We selected October 1, 2018, which is within the last two months of our 2018 fiscal year, to allow sufficient time to identify and collect the information necessary for this analysis given our large number of employees and the global scope of our operations. October 1 is also the same date we used for this purpose in 2017. We did not use the same person identified last year as our "median employee" because that person worked for National Beef, an entity we no longer consolidate. 
To identify the 2018 "median employee" from our employee population, we conducted an analysis of our entire employee population. Given the variety of the jobs filled by our employees across multiple industries, we use a variety of pay elements to compensate our employees. For example, some employees are paid an hourly wage while others are paid a fixed salary. In addition, many of our employees have historically received cash bonuses. Consequently, for purposes of measuring the compensation of our employees, we used payroll data and selected all wages paid (including hourly, overtime and salary) and all bonuses paid as the most appropriate measure of compensation. We converted all foreign currency into U.S. dollars. We used all such compensation paid to our employees for the period January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018. In making these calculations, we annualized (through September 30, 2018), as permitted, the compensation of those permanent employees who were hired after January 1, 2018.
In our analysis, we did not annualize or otherwise adjust compensation for temporary or seasonal employees and did not make any full-time adjustments for anyone. Additionally, we made no cost-of-living adjustments in our calculations.
With respect to the annual total compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for the entire 2018 fiscal year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
For our 2018 Summary Compensation Table data attributed to our CEO, we used $44,674,213 with no adjustments. Using this methodology, we determined that the "median employee" among our approximately 4,643 employees was a Senior Research Associate at Jefferies LLC making approximately $150,000 a year. Based on this information, we estimate that, for 2018, our CEO's annual total compensation was approximately 298 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees.
The numbers above, however, are misleading because this compares three years' worth of compensation to a single-year median compensation. Were we to use the compensation from our Summary Compensation Table that our Compensation Committee intended to apply to 2018 compensation year, $18,714,250, our CEO's 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 125 times that of the median of the 2018 annual total compensation of all other employees.

Proposal III   Ratification of Independent Auditors 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee selected Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) as our independent auditors for 2019, and we are requesting our shareholders to ratify this selection. This proposal is being submitted to shareholders because we believe that this action follows sound corporate practice and is in the best interests of the shareholders. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, such a vote will not be binding, but the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of independent auditors. If the shareholders ratify the selection, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still direct the appointment of new independent auditors at any time during the year if they believe that this change would be in our and our shareholders' best interests.
Prior to 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers had served as our independent auditors for over 50 years. During 2017, our Audit Committee conducted a competitive selection process to determine our independent auditor for 2017. On April 11, 2017, our Audit Committee approved the engagement of Deloitte as our new independent auditors.
In connection with its selection of Deloitte, on April 11, 2017, our Audit Committee determined that our engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers would cease effective upon the filing of our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ending December 31, 2015 and 2016 and the subsequent interim period through April 11, 2017, there were (1) no disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to PricewaterhouseCoopers' satisfaction, would have caused PricewaterhouseCoopers to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years and (2) no "reportable events," as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
We did not consult with Deloitte during our fiscal years ending December 31, 2015 or 2016 or through the date of their engagement regarding either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to us or oral advice was provided that Deloitte concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and (v) of Regulation S-K.
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees incurred by us for 2018 and 2017 relating to services performed by Deloitte:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Fees for 2018 and 2017 include fees incurred by Jefferies Group aggregating $7,590,065 and $8,048,098, respectively. In the table above, in accordance with the SEC's definitions and  rules, Audit Fees are fees paid for professional services for the audit of our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Qs, and for services that are normally provided by the  accountants in connection with regulatory filings or engagements. Audit Related Fees are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. Tax Fees are fees for tax  compliance, tax advice and tax planning. All Other Fees are fees for services not included in the first three categories. All services were approved by the Audit Committee. 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit work performed by our independent auditor. Specifically, the Committee has pre-approved certain specific categories of work and initially authorized annual amounts for each category. For additional services or services in an amount above the initially authorized annual amount, additional authorization from the Audit Committee is required. The Audit Committee delegated to the Audit Committee chair the ability to provide both general pre-approvals (where no specific, case-by-case approval is necessary) and specific pre-approvals. Any pre-approval decisions made by the Committee chair under this delegated authority are reported to the full Audit Committee. All requests for services provided by our independent auditor that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee are required to be submitted to our Chief Financial Officer to ensure that such services are within the scope of those services that have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Chief Financial Officer reports to the Audit Committee periodically.
We have been advised that representatives of Deloitte, our independent auditors for 2018, will attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of our financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles and the establishment and effectiveness of internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable laws and regulations. Our independent auditors during 2018, Deloitte & Touche LLP, were responsible for performing an independent audit of our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and expressing an opinion as to the conformity of our financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent auditors had free access to the Audit Committee to discuss any matters they deemed appropriate.
In performing our oversight role, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements with each of management and our independent auditors and discussed with our independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as required by the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and letters from our independent auditors in accordance with the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding auditor independence and has discussed with the auditors the auditors' independence. Based on the reports and discussions described in this Report, the Committee recommended to our Board that our audited financial statements for 2018 be included in our Transition Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

The following tables reconcile financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to all non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Proxy Statement. We sometimes use non-GAAP financial measures to aid investors in viewing our businesses and investments through the eyes of management while facilitating a comparison across historical periods. For example, management uses certain financial measures using tangible deployable assets or tangible equity because management believes that tangible deployable assets are the assets available for investment purposes to earn a return for our shareholders and changes in tangible equity better indicate to management and our shareholders how we performed given the equity available to management to invest. 
However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Subject to the broker non-vote rules discussed above, if instructions are not given, proxies will be voted for the election of each nominee, for the approval of our executive officer compensation and for the ratification of our independent auditors. Other than shares held in our Profit Sharing Plan, your shares will not be voted if you do not return a signed proxy card or vote in person, by telephone or via the internet.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and holding in street name? Shareholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, you are considered a "shareholder of record" of those shares.
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name. In that case, you will have received these proxy materials from the organization holding your account and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization as to how to vote the shares held in your account.

Important Information for Our Shareholders
INFORMATION FOR OUR PROFIT SHARING PLAN PARTICIPANTS
For participants in our Profit Sharing Plan (PSP), your shares will be voted by Fidelity Management Trust Company, the plan administrator, as you instruct by returning your signed proxy card. If you sign and return your proxy card but do not designate how your shares should be voted, your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board of Directors. You may also vote your shares online at proxyvote.com or by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903. You cannot vote your shares in the PSP in person at the meeting. To allow sufficient time for voting, your vote must be received by no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on Monday, March 25, 2019. If you do not provide your vote by that time, your shares in the PSP will be voted pro rata based on the votes timely received by Fidelity.
REVOCATION OF PROXIES
Any proxy may be revoked at any time before it is exercised by giving written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, at our address set forth herein, by executing and delivering a later-dated proxy, either in writing, by telephone or via the internet, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not alone constitute revocation of a proxy. If your shares are held in a brokerage, bank, or other institutional account, you must obtain a proxy from that entity showing that you were the record holder as of the close of business on January 31, 2019 in order to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting.
REQUIRED VOTES FOR EACH PROPOSAL
Election of Directors – Our by-laws require that each director in an uncontested election be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such director. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director.
Approval of Executive Officer Compensation – The approval of our named executive officer compensation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our common shares voted on the matter. The vote is advisory and therefore is not binding on the Compensation Committee, our Board of Directors or us.
Ratification of Deloitte as Auditors – Ratification of the selection of Deloitte as our independent auditors requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares voted on the matter.
BROKER NON-VOTES AND ABSTENTIONS
A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for the meeting with respect to the ratification of our auditors but does not vote on non-discretionary matters because you did not provide voting instructions on these matters.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and therefore will have no effect for the purpose of determining whether any of our proposals have been approved.
