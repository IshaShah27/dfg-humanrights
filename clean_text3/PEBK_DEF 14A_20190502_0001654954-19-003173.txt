OTHER BUSINESS. To consider any other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Who can vote?    Only  holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on  March 8, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to  notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment of  the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 5,997,136 shares  of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote and 658  shareholders of record.  
    How do I vote by proxy?    You may  vote your shares by marking, signing and dating the enclosed proxy  card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or by  voting electronically over the Internet or by telephone using the  information on the proxy card. If you return your signed proxy card  before the Annual Meeting, the proxies will vote your shares as you  direct. The Board of Directors has appointed proxies to represent  shareholders who cannot attend the Annual Meeting in  person.  
      For the  election of directors, you may vote for (1) all of the nominees,  (2) none of the nominees, or (3) all of the nominees except those  you designate. If a nominee for election as a director becomes  unavailable for election at any time at or before the Annual  Meeting, the proxies will vote your shares for a substitute  nominee. For each other item of business, you may vote  "FOR" or "AGAINST" or you may  "ABSTAIN" from voting.  
      If you  return your signed proxy card but do not specify how you want to  vote your shares, the proxies will vote them "FOR" the  election of all of our nominees for directors and "FOR"  all other proposals presented in this Proxy Statement in accordance  with recommendations from the Board of Directors.  
      If your  shares are held in the name of a broker or other nominee  (i.e., held in  "street name"), you will need to obtain a proxy  instruction card from the broker holding your shares and return the  card as directed by your broker. Your broker is not  permitted to vote on your behalf on the election of directors  unless you provide specific instructions by following the  instructions from your broker about voting your shares by telephone  or Internet or completing and returning the voting instruction card  provided by your broker. For your vote to be counted in the  election of directors you will need to communicate your voting  decision to your bank, broker or other holder of record before the  date of the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      We are  not aware of any other matters to be brought before the Annual  Meeting. If matters other than those discussed above are properly  brought before the Annual Meeting, the proxies may vote your shares  in accordance with their best judgment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    How do I change or revoke my proxy?    You can  change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the  Annual Meeting in any of three ways: (1) by delivering a written  notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company; (2) by  delivering another properly signed proxy card to the Secretary of  the Company with a more recent date than your first proxy card or  by changing your vote by telephone or the Internet; or (3) by  attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. You should  deliver your written notice or superseding proxy to the Secretary  of the Company at our principal executive offices listed  above.  
    How many votes can I cast?    You are  entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date on  each nominee for election and each other matter presented for a  vote at the Annual Meeting. You may not vote your shares  cumulatively in the election of directors.  
    How many votes are required to approve the proposals?    If a  quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, each director nominee will  be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy.  If you withhold your vote on a nominee, your shares will not be  counted as having voted for that nominee. The proposal to ratify  the appointment of the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm for 2019 will be approved if the votes cast  in favor exceed the votes cast in opposition.  
      The  proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's named  executive officers is advisory only; however, the Company's  Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when  evaluating compensation arrangements for executive  compensation.  
      The  proposal to vote on the frequency in which the shareholders approve  the compensation of the Company's named executive officers is  advisory only; however the Board of Directors will consider the  outcome of the vote when determining the frequency in which the  compensation of the Company's named executive officers is  submitted to the shareholders for approval.  
      Any  other matters properly coming before the Annual Meeting for a vote  will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of  the shares represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting  and entitled to vote on that matter.  
      In the  event there are insufficient votes present at the Annual Meeting  for a quorum or to approve or ratify any proposal, the Annual  Meeting may be adjourned in order to permit the further  solicitation of proxies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What constitutes a "quorum" for the Annual  Meeting?    A  majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to  vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by  proxy, constitutes a quorum (a quorum is necessary to conduct  business at the Annual Meeting). Your shares will be considered  part of the quorum if you have voted your shares by proxy or by  telephone or Internet. Abstentions, broker non-votes and votes  withheld from any director nominee count as shares present at the  Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum.  
    Who pays for the solicitation of proxies?    We will  pay the cost of preparing, printing and mailing materials in  connection with this solicitation of proxies. In addition to  solicitation by mail, our officers, directors and regular  employees, as well as those of the Bank, may make solicitations  personally, by telephone or otherwise without additional  compensation for doing so. We reserve the right to engage a proxy  solicitation firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the  Annual Meeting. We will, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms,  banks and others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in  forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of stock or  otherwise in connection with this solicitation of  proxies.

Our Board of Directors held 14 meetings during 2018. All incumbent directors attended more than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees on which they served during the year.
 What is our policy for director attendance at Annual Meetings?
Although it is customary for all of our directors to attend Annual Meetings of Shareholders, we have no formal policy in place requiring attendance. All members of the Board of Directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 3, 2018.
 How can you communicate with the Board or its members?
We do not have formal procedures for shareholder communication with our Board of Directors. In general, our directors and officers are easily accessible by telephone, postal mail or e-mail. Any matter intended for your Board of Directors, or any individual director, can be directed to Lance Sellers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or Joe Lampron, our Chief Financial Officer, at our principal executive offices at 518 West C Street, Newton, North Carolina 28658.

 Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
Our Company and the Bank have traditionally operated with separate Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors positions. We believe it is our Chief Executive Officer's responsibility to manage the Company and the Chairman's responsibility to lead the Board of Directors. Robert Abernethy is currently serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and James Abernethy is currently serving as the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Other than Directors Lineberger and Matthews, all of the members of the Board of Directors are independent under applicable  NASDAQ listing requirements. The Company has five standing committees: Executive, Loan Sub-Committee, Governance, Audit and Compensation. The Chief Executive Officer serves on the Executive Committee. addition to the above-named committees has a Loan Committee and a Loan Sub-Committee. The duties of the Company's committees are described below. Each of the Company's and the Bank's committees considers risk within its area of responsibility. The Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors focus on the Company's most significant risks in the areas of liquidity, credit, interest rate and general risk management strategy. The Board of Directors sets policy guidelines in the areas of loans and asset/liability management which are reviewed on an on-going basis. While the Board of Directors oversees the Company's risk management, the Company's and the Bank's management are responsible for day-to-day risk management following the dictates of the policy decisions set by the Board of Directors.
The Governance Committee, as part of its annual review, evaluates the Board of Directors leadership structure and performance and reports its findings to the whole Board of Directors. The Board of Directors believes that having separate persons serving as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and all independent directors provides the optimal board leadership structure for the Company and its shareholders.
 Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Company and the Bank have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for its directors, officers and employees. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that individuals avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all laws and other legal requirements, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in the best interests of the Company and the Bank. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a guide to help ensure that all employees live up to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Bank's website (www.peoplesbanknc.com) under Investor Relations.
As is permitted by SEC rules, the Company intends to post on its website any amendment to or waiver from any provision in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Controller, or persons performing similar functions, and that relates to any element of the standards enumerated in the rules of the SEC.
 Diversity of the Board of Directors
The Company and the Bank do not have written diversity policies.  However, the Company and the Bank value diversity in society, and believe that the virtues and pursuit of diversity are just as important within the Company and the Bank.  The Company and the Bank adhere to a policy prohibiting discrimination and harassment on the basis of legally protected characteristics, including sex, pregnancy, race, color, religion, national origin, veteran status, age, and disability. While there are currently no women or minorities serving on the Board of Directors, any qualified candidate receives equal consideration.
 How can a shareholder nominate someone for election to the Board of Directors
Our Bylaws provide that in order to be eligible for consideration at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, all nominations of directors, other than those made by the Governance Committee or the Board of Directors, must be in writing and must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not less than 50 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting at which such nominations will be made. However, if less than 60 days' notice of the meeting is given to the shareholders, such nominations must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the notice of meeting was mailed.

Upon the instruction of the Board of Directors, the inspector of voting for the Annual Meeting may disregard all votes cast for a nominee if the nomination does not comply with these requirements. Written notice of nominations should be directed to the Secretary of the Company. The Bank has ten directors currently serving on its Board of Directors, who are the same people who are currently directors of the Company.
 Board Committees
During 2018, our Board of Directors had five standing committees, the Audit and Enterprise Risk Committee, the Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Executive Committee and the Loan Sub-Committee. The voting members of these Committees are appointed by the Board of Directors annually from among its members. Certain of our executive officers also serve as non-voting, advisory members of these committees.

The Governance Committee's identification of candidates for director typically results from the business interactions of the members of the Governance Committee or from recommendations received from other directors or from the Company's management.
If a shareholder recommends a director candidate to the Governance Committee in accordance with the Company's Bylaws, the Governance Committee will consider the candidate and apply the same considerations that it would to its own candidates. The recommendation of a candidate by a shareholder should be made in writing, addressed to the attention of the Governance Committee at the Company's corporate headquarters. The recommendation should include a description of the candidate's background, his or her contact information, and any other information the shareholder considers useful and appropriate for the Governance Committee's consideration of the candidate. The criteria which have been established by the Governance Committee as bearing on the consideration of a candidate's qualification to serve as a director include the following: the candidate's ethics, integrity, involvement in the community, success in business, relationship with the Bank, investment in the Company, place of residence (i.e., proximity to the Bank's market area), and financial expertise.

 Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information with respect to the compensation paid during the year ended December 31, 2018 to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Lance A. Sellers, our Chief Financial Officer, A. Joseph Lampron, Jr. and William D. Cable, Sr. (together, our "named executive officers").
Compensation Committee Processes and Procedures. The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in determining appropriate compensation levels for the members of the Board of Directors and our named executive officers. It also has strategic and administrative responsibility for a broad range of compensation issues. It seeks to ensure that we compensate key management employees effectively and in a manner consistent with the Compensation Committee's stated compensation strategy and relevant requirements of various regulatory entities. A part of these responsibilities is overseeing the administration of executive compensation and employee benefit plans, including the design, selection of participants, establishment of performance measures, and evaluation of awards pursuant to our annual and long-term incentive programs.
Compensation Philosophy. The overall objective of our executive compensation program is to align total compensation so that the individual executive believes it is fair and equitable and provides the highest perceived value to our shareholders and to that individual. In order to accomplish this overall objective, our executive compensation program is designed to: (i) attract qualified executives necessary to meet our needs as defined by the Company's strategic plans, and (ii) retain and motivate executives whose performance supports the achievement of our long-term plans and short-term goals. The executive compensation program is founded upon the idea that a strong, performance-oriented compensation program, which is generally consistent with the practices of our peers, is a key ingredient in becoming a leading performer among financial institutions of similar size, and is, therefore, in the best interests of our shareholders.
The Compensation Committee considers a number of factors specific to each executive's role when determining the amount and mix of compensation to be paid. These factors are:
 compensation of the comparable executives at comparable financial institutions;
 financial performance of the Company (especially on a "net operating" basis, which excludes the effect of one-time gains and expenses) over the most recent fiscal year and the prior three years;
 composition of earnings;
 asset quality relative to the banking industry;
 responsiveness to the economic environment;
 the Company's achievement compared to its corporate, financial, strategic and operational objectives and business plans; and
 cumulative shareholder return.
               Elements of the Executive Compensation Program. The Company's and the Bank's compensation program consists of the following elements:   Base Salary. The salaries of our named executive officers are designed to provide a reasonable level of compensation that is affordable to the Company and fair to the executive. Salaries are reviewed annually, and adjustments, if any, are made based on the review of competitive salaries in our peer group, as well as an evaluation of the individual officer's responsibilities, job scope, and individual performance. For example, we assess each officer's success in achieving budgeted earnings and return ratios, business conduct and integrity, and leadership and team building skills.
Annual Cash Incentive Awards. We believe that annual cash incentive awards encourage our named executive officers to achieve short-term targets that are critical to achievement of our long-term strategic plan. The Bank has a Management Incentive Plan for officers of the Bank. Participants in the Management Incentive Plan are recommended annually by the President and Chief Executive Officer to the Bank's Board of Directors. Each individual's incentive pool is determined by a formula which links attainment of corporate budget with attainment of individual goals and objectives. Incentives under the Management Incentive Plan are paid annually. No named executive officer earned or was paid a cash incentive under the Management Incentive Plan during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Discretionary Bonus and Service Awards. From time to time the Compensation Committee may recommend to the Board of Directors that additional bonuses be paid based on accomplishments that significantly exceed expectations during the fiscal year. These bonuses are totally discretionary as to who will receive a bonus and the amount of any such bonus. In 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, discretionary bonuses as follows: $90,000 for Mr. Sellers; $55,000 for Mr. Lampron; and $50,000 for Mr. Cable. These discretionary bonuses were paid in January of 2019. Under the Service Recognition Program, the Bank gives service awards to each employee and director for every five years of service with the Bank to promote longevity of service for both directors and employees. Service awards are made in the form of shares of the Company's common stock plus cash in the amount necessary to pay taxes on the award. The number of shares awarded increases with the number of years of service to the Bank.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards. The Company maintains the 2009 Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan ("Omnibus Plan"), under which it is permitted to grant incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, book value shares, and performance units. The purpose of the Omnibus Plan is to promote the interests of the Company by attracting and retaining directors and employees of outstanding ability and to provide executives of the Company greater incentive to make material contributions to the success of the Company by providing them with stock-based compensation which will increase in value based upon the market performance of the common stock and/or the corporate achievement of financial and other performance objectives.
In making its decision to grant awards to the Company's named executive officers under the Omnibus Plan, the Compensation Committee considers all elements of such named executive officer's compensation. In considering the number of awards to grant to the Company's named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers each named executive officer's contribution to the Company's performance.
The Company did not grant any plan-based awards to its named executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. See "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" on page 19 of this Proxy Statement and "Option Exercises and Stock Vested" on page 19 of this Proxy Statement for information on grants and vesting of restricted stock units to the named executed officers during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2017. See "Omnibus Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan" starting on page 22 of this Proxy Statement for additional information on the Omnibus Plan.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements. The Bank provides non-qualified supplemental executive retirement benefit in the form of Amended and Restated Executive Salary Continuation Agreements with Messrs. Sellers, Lampron and Cable. The Committee's goal is to provide competitive retirement benefits given the restrictions on executives within tax-qualified plans. In prior years, the Compensation Committee worked with a compensation consultant in analyzing the possible benefits of using supplemental retirement benefits to address the issues of internal and external equity in terms of retirement benefits offered to all employees at the Company as a percentage of  final average pay and executives in our peer group. In connection with the non-qualified supplemental executive retirement benefits, the Bank purchased life insurance contracts on the lives of the named executive officers. The increase in cash surrender value of the life insurance contracts constitutes the Bank's contribution to the plan each year. The Bank will pay benefits to participating officers for a period between 13 years and the life of the officer. The Bank is the sole owner of all of the insurance contracts.  
Profit Sharing Plan and 401(k) Plan. The Bank has a Profit Sharing Plan and 401(k) Plan for all eligible employees. The Bank made no contribution to the Profit Sharing Plan for the year ended December 31, 2018.  No investments in Bank stock have been made by the plan. Under the Bank's 401(k) Plan, the Bank matches employee contributions to a maximum of 4.00% of annual compensation. The Bank's 2018 contribution to the 401(k) Plan pursuant to this formula was approximately $670,000. All contributions to the 401(k) Plan are tax deferred. The Profit Sharing Plan and 401(k) Plan permit participants to choose from investment funds which are selected by a committee comprised of senior management. Employees are eligible to participate in both the 401(k) Plan and Profit Sharing Plan beginning in the second month of employment. Both plans are now "safe harbor" plans, and all participants are immediately 100% vested in all employer contributions.
Deferred Compensation Plan. The Bank maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for directors and certain officers. Eligible officers selected by the Bank's Board of Directors may elect to contribute a percentage of their compensation to the plan. Participating officers may elect to invest their deferred compensation in a restricted list of investment funds. The Bank may make matching or other contributions to the plan as well, in amounts determined at the discretion of the Bank. Participants are fully vested in all amounts contributed to the plan by them or on their behalf. The Bank has established a Rabbi Trust to hold the accrued benefits of the participants under the plan. There are no "above-market" returns provided for in this plan. The Bank made no contributions to the plan in 2018. Benefits under the plan are payable in the event of the participant's retirement, death, termination, or as a result of hardship. Benefit payments may be made in a lump sum or in installments, as selected by the participant.
Employment Agreements. The Company has employment agreements with each named executive officer, which the Board of Directors believes serve a number of functions, including (i) retention of the executive team; (ii) mitigation of any uncertainty about future employment and continuity of management in the event of a change in control; and (iii) protection of the Company and customers through non-compete and non-solicitation covenants. Additional information regarding the employment agreements, including a description of key terms may be found starting on page 21 of this Proxy Statement.
Other Benefits. Executive officers are entitled to participate in fringe benefit plans offered to employees including health and dental insurance plans and life, accidental death and dismemberment and long-term disability plans. In addition, the Bank has paid country club dues for each named executive officer and provides a car allowance to Mr. Sellers.
The above elements of each named executive officer's compensation are not inter-related. For example, if vesting standards on restricted stock awards are not achieved, the executive's base salary is not increased to make up the difference. Similarly, the value of previously granted options is not considered by the Compensation Committee in recommending the other elements of the compensation package.
The Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant during the year ended December 31, 2018. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the compensation of the executive officers other than his own. The President and Chief Executive Officer participates in the deliberations, but not in the decisions, of the Compensation Committee regarding compensation of executive officers. He does not participate in the Compensation Committee's discussion or decisions regarding his own compensation. The Compensation Committee reports its actions to the Board of Directors and keeps written minutes of its meetings, which minutes are maintained with the books and records of the Company.
The Compensation Committee also considers the results of the shareholders' non-binding vote on executive compensation. At the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 52% of the shareholders who voted at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders elected to review the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers once every three years. As a result, the Company submitted, in a non-binding advisory proposal, the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 94% of the shareholders who voted at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders approved the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers as presented to the shareholders in the 2016 proxy statement. The Company, pursuant to this Proxy Statement, submits a vote to the shareholders on the compensation of its named executive officers and the frequency on which shareholders review such compensation. 
2018 Compensation Disclosure Ratio of the Median Annual Total Compensation of All Company Employees to the Annual Total Compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer
We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform in ways that enhance shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees.  The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to that of all other Company employees (including all employees of the Bank) for the same period.  The calculation of annual total compensation of all employees was determined in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" shown for our Chief Executive Officer in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 18 of this Proxy Statement. 
The calculation below includes all employees as of October 31, 2018.
The 2018 compensation disclosure ratio of the median annual total compensation of all Company employees to the annual total compensation of the Company's chief executive officer is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Median  Annual Total Compensation of All Employees (excluding Lance A.  Sellers, Chief Executive Officer)    $45,051

 Employment Agreements
On January 22, 2015, the Company, the Bank and each of (i) Lance A. Sellers, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, (ii) A. Joseph Lampron, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Bank and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Treasurer of the Company and (iii) William D. Cable, Sr., Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bank and Executive Vice President, Assistant Corporate Treasurer and Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company executed an Employment Agreement which replaced and superseded such executive's prior employment agreement (collectively, the "Employment Agreements").
Each Employment Agreement provides for an initial term of 36 months beginning on January 22, 2015 (the "Effective Date"). On the first anniversary of the Effective Date and on each anniversary thereafter (the "Renewal Date"), each Employment Agreement shall be extended automatically for one additional year unless the Board of Directors of the Company (or the executive determines, and prior to the Renewal Date sends to the other party written notice, that the term shall not be extended. If the Board of Directors of the Company decides not to extend the term, the Employment Agreement shall nevertheless remain in force until its existing term expires. Under the Employment Agreements, the Bank will pay Mr. Sellers a base salary at the rate of at least $311,400 per year, Mr. Lampron a base salary at the rate of at least $193,125 per year and Mr. Cable a base salary at the rate of at least $198,750 per year ("Base Salary"). The Bank will review each executive's total compensation at least annually and in its sole discretion may adjust an executive's total compensation from year to year, but during the term of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Sellers's Base Salary may not decrease below $311,400, Mr. Lampron's Base Salary may not decrease below $193,125 and Mr. Cable's Base Salary may not decrease below $198,750; provided, however, that periodic increases in Base Salary, once granted, may not be subject to revocation. In addition, the Employment Agreements provide for discretionary bonuses and participation in other management incentive, pension, profit-sharing, medical and retirement plans maintained by the Bank, as well as fringe benefits normally associated with such executive's office.
Under the Employment Agreements, each executive's employment will terminate automatically upon death. Otherwise, the Company and the Bank may terminate each executive's employment for "cause", "without cause" or in the  In addition, each Employment Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants prohibiting the executive from competing against the Company and the Bank or soliciting the Company's or the Bank's customers for a period of time following termination of employment, all as more particularly set forth in the Employment Agreements.
 Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Each of the Employment Agreements provide that in the event the Company terminates the employment of a named executive officers Without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreements), or the officer terminates his or her employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreements), in any such case during the employment and at the time of or within one year after a "change of control" (as defined in the Employment Agreements), the officer will be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: (1) the Company will pay the officer the aggregate of the following amounts: (a) the sum of his accrued obligations; (b) the greater of his base salary, divided by 365 and multiplied by the number of days remaining in the employment period, or an amount equal to 2.99 times his base salary; and (c) the product of his aggregate cash bonus for the last completed fiscal year, and a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal year through the date of termination, and the denominator of which is 365; (2) all restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards previously granted to the executive and which have not already become vested and released from restrictions on transfer and repurchase an forfeiture rights, either as a result of the change of control or otherwise, shall immediately vest and be released from such restrictions as of the change of control termination date; and (3) all options previously granted to the officer that are unvested as of the change of control termination date will be deemed vested, fully exercisable and non-forfeitable as of the change of control termination date (other than transfer restrictions applicable to incentive stock options) and all previously granted options that are vested, but unexercised, on the change of control termination date will remain exercisable, in each case for the period during which they would have been exercisable absent the termination of his or her employment, except as otherwise specifically provided by the Internal Revenue Code; and (4) his benefits under all benefit plans that are non-qualified plans will be 100% vested, regardless of his age or years of service, as of the change of control termination date.
If the named executive officers were terminated on December 31, 2018, "without cause" or for "good reason" at the time of or within one year after a "change of control", Mr. Sellers, Mr. Lampron and Mr. Cable would have been entitled to receive compensation of approximately $1,256,000, $795,000 and $798,000, respectively, pursuant to their Employment Agreements. These amounts are calculated based on each officer's 2018 base salary and bonus as shown in the Summary Compensation Table. In addition, if a "change in control" (as defined in the Omnibus Plan) had occurred on December 31, 2018, all unvested restricted stock units previously granted to each of Mr. Sellers, Mr. Lampron and Mr. Cable would have vest immediately. On December 31, 2018, these unvested restricted stock units had a fair market value of $59,731, $44,798 and $44,798, respectively.
 Omnibus Stock Option and Long Term Incentive Plan
The purpose of the Omnibus Plan is to promote the interests of the Company by attracting and retaining directors and employees of outstanding ability and to provide executive and other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries greater incentive to make material contributions to the success of the Company by providing them with stock-based compensation which will increase in value based upon the market performance of the common stock and/or the corporate achievement of financial and other performance objectives. Rights Which May Be Granted. Under the Omnibus Plan, the Committee may grant or award eligible participants stock options, rights to receive restricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units, performance units  (each equivalent to one share of common stock), SARs, and/or book value shares. These grants and awards are referred to herein as "Rights." All Rights must be granted or awarded by February 19, 2019, the tenth anniversary of the date the Board of Directors adopted the Omnibus Plan. The Board of Directors has provided for 360,000 shares of the Company's common stock to be included in the Omnibus Plan to underlie Rights which may be granted thereunder.
Options. Options granted under the Omnibus Plan to eligible directors and employees may be either incentive stock options ("ISOs") or non-qualified stock options ("NSOs"). The exercise price of an ISO or NSO may not be less than 100% of the last-transaction price for the common stock quoted by the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may award Rights to acquire shares of common stock or restricted stock units, subject to certain transfer restrictions ("Restricted Stock" or "Restricted Stock Unit") to eligible participants under the Omnibus Plan for such purchase price per share, if any, as the Committee, in its discretion, may determine appropriate. The Committee will determine the expiration date for each Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit award, up to a maximum of ten years from the date of grant. In the Committee's discretion, it may specify the period or periods of time within which each Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit award will first become exercisable, which period or periods may be accelerated or shortened by the Committee. Under the terms of the Omnibus Plan, the Committee also has the discretion to pay out awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units in the Company's common stock, cash or a combination of stock and cash.
Performance Units. Under the Omnibus Plan, the Committee may grant to eligible directors and employees awards of long term incentive performance units, each equivalent in value to one share of common stock ("Units"). Except as otherwise provided, Units awarded may be distributed only after the end of a performance period of two or more years, as determined by the Committee, beginning with the year in which the awards are granted.
The percentage of the Units awarded that are to be distributed will depend on the level of financial and other performance goals achieved by the Company during the performance period. The Committee may adopt one or more performance categories in addition to, or in substitution for, a performance category or may eliminate all performance categories other than financial performance.
As soon as practicable after each performance period, the percentage of Units awarded that are to be distributed, based on the levels of performance achieved, will be determined and distributed to the recipients of such awards in the form of a combination of shares of common stock and cash or cash only. Units awarded, but which the recipients are not entitled to receive, will be cancelled.
In the event of the death or disability of a Unit recipient prior to the end of any performance period, the number of Units awarded for such performance period will be reduced in proportion to the number of months remaining in the performance period after the date of death or disability. The remaining portion of the award, if any, may, in the discretion of the Committee, be adjusted based upon the levels of performance achieved prior to the date of death or disability, and distributed within a reasonable time after death or disability. In the event a recipient of Units ceases to be an eligible director or employee for any reason other than death or disability, all Units awarded, but not yet distributed, will be cancelled.
In the event of a change in control (as that term is defined in the Omnibus Plan), any outstanding Units will immediately and automatically be reduced as appropriate to reflect a shorter performance period.
An amount equal to the dividend payable on one share of common stock (a "dividend equivalent credit") will be determined and credited on the payment date to each Unit recipient's account for each Unit awarded and not yet distributed or cancelled. Such amount will be converted within the account to an additional number of Units equal to the number of shares of common stock which could be purchased at the last-transaction price of the common stock on the NASDAQ Market on the dividend payment date. If an extraordinary event occurs during a performance period which significantly alters the basis upon which the performance levels were established, the Committee may make adjustments which it deems appropriate in the performance levels. Such events may include changes in accounting practices, tax, financial institution laws or regulations or other laws or regulations, economic changes not in the ordinary course of business cycles, or compliance with judicial decrees or other legal requirements.
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Omnibus Plan provides that the Committee may award to eligible directors and employees Rights to receive cash based upon increases in the market price of common stock over the last transaction price of the common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the "Base Price") on the date of the award. The Committee may adjust the Base Price of a stock appreciation right ("SAR") based upon the market value performance of the common stock in comparison with the aggregate market value performance of a selected index or at a stated annual percentage rate. The expiration date of a SAR may be no more than ten years from the date of award.
Each SAR awarded by the Committee may be exercisable immediately or may become vested over such period or periods as the Committee may establish, which periods may be accelerated or shortened in the Committee's discretion. Each SAR awarded will terminate upon the expiration date established by the Committee, termination of the employment or directorship of the SAR recipient, or in the event of a change in control, as described above in connection with the termination of Options.
Book Value Shares. The Omnibus Plan provides that the Committee may award to eligible directors and eligible employees long term incentive units, each equivalent in value to the book value of one share of common stock on the date of award ("Book Value Shares"). The Committee will specify the period or periods of time within which each Book Value Share will vest, which period or periods may be accelerated or shortened by the Committee. Upon redemption, the holder of a Book Value Share will receive an amount equal to the difference between the book value of the common stock at the time the Book Value Share is awarded and the book value of the common stock at the time the Book Value Share is redeemed, adjusted for the effects of dividends, new share issuances, and mark-to-market valuations of the Company's investment securities portfolio in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The expiration date of each Book Value Share awarded will be established by the Committee, up to a maximum of ten years from the date of award. However, awards of Book Value Shares will terminate earlier in the same manner as described above in connection with the termination of Options.
Adjustments. In the event the outstanding shares of the common stock are increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, share exchange acquisition, or reclassification, appropriate proportionate adjustments will be made in (i) the aggregate number or kind of shares which may be issued pursuant to exercise of, or which underlie, Rights; (ii) the exercise or other purchase price, or Base Price, and the number and/or kind of shares acquirable under, or underlying, Rights; and (iii) rights and matters determined on a per share basis under the Omnibus Plan. Any such adjustment will be made by the Committee, subject to ratification by the Board of Directors. As described above, the Base Price of a SAR may also be adjusted by the Committee to reflect changes in a selected index. Except with regard to Units and Book Value Shares awarded under the Omnibus Plan, no adjustment in the Rights will be required by reason of the issuance of common stock, or securities convertible into common stock, by the Company for cash or the issuance of   shares of common stock by the Company in exchange for shares of the capital stock of any corporation, financial institution or other organization acquired by the Company or a subsidiary thereof in connection therewith.  
 Any shares of common stock allocated to Rights granted under the Omnibus Plan which are subsequently cancelled or forfeited will be available for further allocation upon such cancellation or forfeiture.
 Director Compensation
Directors' Fees. Members of the Company's Board of Directors receive no fees or compensation for their service. However, all members of the Board of Directors are also directors of the Bank and are compensated for that service.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, each director received a fee of $1,000 for each Bank Board of Directors meeting attended, an additional fee of $750 for each committee meeting attended and a retainer of $12,000. In addition, the Chairman of the Bank's Board of Directors received an additional $250 per meeting attended and the chairpersons of each committee received an additional $150 per meeting attended. Directors receive $500 for special meetings held via conference call in lieu of the Board of Director and committee meeting fees set forth above.
Directors who are members of the Board of Directors of Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc., Peoples Investment Services, Inc. and PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC, and Community Bank Real Estate Solutions, LLC, subsidiaries of the Bank, receive $750 per meeting.
The Bank maintains a Service Recognition Program, under which directors, officers and employees are eligible for awards. Under the Service Recognition Program, directors, officers and employees are awarded a combination of common stock of the Company and cash in the amount necessary to pay taxes on the award, with the amount of the award based upon the length of service to the Bank. Any common stock awarded under the Service Recognition Program is purchased by the Bank on the open market, and no new shares are issued by the Company under the Service Recognition Program.
Directors' Stock Benefits Plan. Members of the Board of Directors are eligible to participate in the Company's Omnibus Plan. On March 22, 2012, the Company granted 891 Restricted Stock Units, each Restricted Stock Unit being comprised of the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, to each director. The Restricted Stock Units awarded to directors on March 22, 2012 vested in full on March 22, 2017, and upon vesting, each Restricted Stock Unit had a market value of $25.91 for a total value of $23,085, which was distributed to each director in a combination of stock or cash, as chosen by each director. On May 23, 2013, the Company granted 891 Restricted Stock Units, each Restricted Stock Unit being comprised of the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, to each director. The Restricted Stock Units awarded to directors on May 23, 2013 vested in full on May 23, 2017, and upon vesting, each Restricted Stock Unit had a market value of $24.94 for a total value of $22,218, which was distributed to each director in a combination of stock or cash, as chosen by each director. On February 20, 2014, the Company granted 715 Restricted Stock Units, each Restricted Stock Unit being comprised of the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, to each director. The Restricted Stock Units awarded to directors on February 20, 2014 vested in full on February 20, 2017, and upon vesting, each Restricted Stock Unit had a market value of $24.78 for a total value of $17,719, which was distributed to each director in a combination of stock or cash, as chosen by each director. On February 19, 2015, the Company granted 413 Restricted Stock Units, each unit being comprised of the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, to each director. The Restricted Stock Units awarded to directors on February 19, 2015 vested in full on February 19, 2019. The number of Restricted Stock Units granted and the grant date fair value of each Restricted Stock Unit have been restated to reflect the 10% stock dividend issued in December, 2017. The Company did not grant any plan-based awards to directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
 Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. The Bank maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for all of its directors. The Bank's directors are also directors of the Company. Under the deferred compensation plan, each director may defer all or a portion of his fees to the plan each year. The director may elect to invest the deferred compensation in a restricted list of investment funds. The Bank may make matching contributions to the plan for the benefit of the director from time to time at the discretion of the Bank. Directors are fully vested in all amounts they   contribute to the plan and in any amounts contributed by the Bank. The Bank has established a Rabbi Trust to hold the directors' accrued benefits under the plan. There are no "above-market" returns provided for in the deferred compensation plan. The Bank made no contributions to this plan in 2018.
Benefits under the plan are payable in the event of the director's death, resignation, removal, failure to be re-elected, retirement or in cases of hardship. Directors may elect to receive deferred compensation payments in one lump sum or in installments.
Directors' Supplemental Retirement Plan. The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental retirement benefits plan for all its directors. The supplemental retirement benefits plan is designed to provide a retirement benefit to the directors while at the same time minimizing the financial impact on the Bank's earnings. Under the supplemental retirement benefits plan, the Company purchased life insurance contracts on the lives of each director. The increase in cash surrender value of the contracts constitutes the Company's contribution to the supplemental retirement benefits plan each year. The Bank will pay annual benefits to each director for 15 years beginning upon retirement from the Board of Directors. The Bank is the sole owner of all of the insurance contracts.
The following table reports all forms of compensation paid to or accrued for the benefit of each director during the 2018 fiscal year.

 Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings represents the expense accrued by the Bank for each director under the Directors' Supplemental Retirement Plan as described above. In 2018, Director Robinson received 104 shares of PEBK stock and $750.00 in cash for his 25 years of service as a director under the Bank's Service Recognition Program.  Indebtedness of and Transactions with Managementand Directors
The Company is a "listed issuer" under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act whose common stock is listed on NASDAQ. The Company uses the definition of independence contained in NASDAQ's listing standards to determine the independence of its directors and that the Board of Directors and each standing committee of the Board of Directors is in compliance with NASDAQ listing standards for independence.
Certain directors and executive officers of the Bank and their immediate families and associates were customers of and had transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of business during 2018. All outstanding loans, extensions of credit or overdrafts, endorsements and guarantees outstanding at any time during 2018 to the Bank's executive officers and directors and their family members were made in the ordinary course of its business. These loans are currently made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those then prevailing for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender, and did not involve and directors and their family members were made in the ordinary course of its business. These loans are currently made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those then prevailing for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present any other unfavorable features.
The Board of Directors routinely, and no less than annually, reviews all transactions, direct and indirect, between the Company or the Bank and any employee or director, or any of such person's immediate family members. The standard applied to such transactions are to review such transactions for comparable market values for similar transactions. All material facts of the transactions and the director's interest are discussed by all disinterested directors and a decision is made about whether the transaction is fair to the Company and the Bank. A majority vote of all disinterested directors is required to approve the transaction. See "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics" on page 11 of this Proxy Statement. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were no related party transactions that would be required to be reported that were not reviewed in accordance with the above.
The Bank leases two of its facilities from Shortgrass Associates, L.L.C. ("Shortgrass"). Director John W. Lineberger, Jr. owns 25% of the membership interests in Shortgrass. Each of the facilities is subject to a 20-year lease between the Bank and Shortgrass. Pursuant to the terms of the leases for the two facilities leased by the Bank, during 2018 the Bank paid a total of $230,232 to Shortgrass in lease payments for these facilities, and the dollar value of Director John W. Lineberger, Jr.'s interest in such lease payments was approximately $57,558 (or 25% x $230,232). The total aggregate dollar value of all lease payments due by the Bank to Shortgrass starting on January 1, 2018 and continuing until the end of each lease, is $906,136, and the total aggregate dollar value of Director John W. Lineberger, Jr.'s interest in all such lease payments is approximately $226,534 (or 25% x $906,136).
The Board of Directors also evaluates the influence family relationships may have on the independence of directors who are related by blood or marriage. Christine S. Abernethy, a greater than ten percent (10%) shareholder of the Company, has two sons, Robert C. Abernethy and James S. Abernethy, who serve on the Board of Directors. All of the non-related directors have determined that the family relationships among Christine S. Abernethy, James S. Abernethy and Robert C. Abernethy do not affect the brothers' independence as directors.  Equity Compensation Plan Information

 Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc.  PROPOSAL 2
 ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE
 COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law on July 21, 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that our shareholders be provided an opportunity to cast a separate advisory vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed in the compensation tables and related matches in this Proxy Statement. 
The Company believes that our 2018 compensation policies and procedures are centered on a pay-for-performance culture and are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders.  These policies and procedures are described in detail in this Proxy Statement.
This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to vote on the compensation of our named executive officers through the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc. approve the compensation of its Named Executive Officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement, as described in the narrative and the tabular disclosure regarding the compensation of the Named Executive Officers contained in this Proxy Statement."
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, your vote on this matter is advisory and will therefore not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee will take the outcome of the vote into account when determining further executive compensation arrangements.
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL.
 PROPOSAL 3
 ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) PROPOSAL ON THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH
 SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED
 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The Company is presenting the following proposal, which gives the shareholders the opportunity to inform the Company as to how often you wish the Company to include a proposal, similar to Proposal 2, in its Proxy Statement.  This resolution is required pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.  While our Board intends to carefully consider the shareholder vote resulting from the proposal, the final vote will not be binding on us and is advisory in nature. 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders wish the company to include an advisory vote on the overall compensation of the Company's named executive officers: (i) every year; (ii) every other year; or (iii) every three years."
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote to hold an advisory vote on the overall compensation of the Company's named executive officers every three years. 
The Board of Directors believes the three-year option is best as shareholder feedback would be more useful if the success of a compensation program is judged over a period of time.   
 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE TO HOLD AN
 ADVISORY VOTE ON THE OVERALL COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE
 OFFICERS EVERY THREE YEARS.  PROPOSAL 4

PEOPLES BANCORP OF NORTH CAROLINA, INC.
 General Description of Business
Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc. ("Bancorp"), was formed in 1999 to serve as the holding company for Peoples Bank (the "Bank"). Bancorp is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Bancorp's principal source of income is dividends declared and paid by the Bank on its capital stock, if any. Bancorp has no operations and conducts no business of its own other than owning the Bank. Accordingly, the discussion of the business which follows concerns the business conducted by the Bank, unless otherwise indicated. Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, along with the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively called the "Company".
The Bank, founded in 1912, is a state-chartered commercial bank serving the citizens and business interests of the Catawba Valley and surrounding communities through 20 banking offices, as of December 31, 2018, located in Lincolnton, Newton, Denver, Catawba, Conover, Maiden, Claremont, Hiddenite, Hickory, Charlotte, Cornelius, Mooresville, Raleigh, and Cary North Carolina. The Bank also operates loan production offices in Denver and Durham, North Carolina. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.1 billion, net loans of $797.6 million, deposits of $877.2 million, total securities of $198.9 million, and shareholders' equity of $123.6 million.
The Bank operates three banking offices focused on the Latino population that were formerly operated as a division of the Bank under the name Banco de la Gente ("Banco"). These offices are now branded as Bank branches and considered a separate market territory of the Bank as they offer normal and customary banking services as are offered in the Bank's other branches such as the taking of deposits and the making of loans.
The Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, with no foreign loans and few agricultural loans. Real estate loans are predominately variable rate and fixed rate commercial property loans, which include residential development loans to commercial customers. Commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries with no one particular industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio. The majority of the Bank's deposit and loan customers are individuals and small to medium-sized businesses located in the Bank's market area. The Bank's loan portfolio also includes Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) mortgage loans generated thorough the Bank's Banco offices. Additional discussion of the Bank's loan portfolio and sources of funds for loans can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on pages A-4 through A-23 of the Annual Report, which is included in this Form 10-K as Exhibit (13).
The operations of the Bank and depository institutions in general are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of depository institution regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the "Commissioner").
The Company's fiscal year ends December 31. This Form 10-K is also being used as the Bank's Annual Disclosure Statement under FDIC Regulations. This Form 10-K has not been reviewed, or confirmed for accuracy or relevance by the FDIC.
At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 310 full-time employees and 35 part-time employees, which equated to 334 full-time equivalent employees.
 Subsidiaries
The Bank is a subsidiary of the Company. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had four subsidiaries, Peoples Investment Services, Inc., Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc., Community Bank Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("CBRES") and PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC. Through a relationship with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., Peoples Investment Services, Inc. provides the Bank's customers access to investment counseling and non-deposit investment products such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, tax deferred annuities, and related brokerage services. Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc. provides real estate appraisal and real estate brokerage services. CBRES serves as a "clearing-house" for appraisal services for community banks. Other banks are able to contract with CBRES to find and engage appropriate appraisal companies in the area where the property to be appraised is located. This type of service ensures that the appraisal process remains independent from the financing process within the Bank. PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC acquires, manages and disposes of real property, other collateral and other assets obtained in the ordinary course of collecting debts previously contracted.
A-1
In June 2006, the Company formed a wholly owned Delaware statutory trust, PEBK Capital Trust II ("PEBK Trust II"), which issued $20.0 million of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Company's junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. All of the common securities of PEBK Trust II are owned by the Company. The proceeds from the issuance of the common securities and the trust preferred securities were used by PEBK Trust II to purchase $20.6 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company, which pay a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 163 basis points. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures were used in December 2006 to repay the trust preferred securities issued in December 2001 by PEBK Capital Trust, a wholly owned Delaware statutory trust of the Company, and for general purposes. The debentures represent the sole asset of PEBK Trust II. PEBK Trust II is not included in the consolidated financial statements.
The trust preferred securities issued by PEBK Trust II accrue and pay quarterly at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 163 basis points. The Company has guaranteed distributions and other payments due on the trust preferred securities to the extent PEBK Trust II does not have funds with which to make the distributions and other payments. The net combined effect of the trust preferred securities transaction is that the Company is obligated to make the distributions and other payments required on the trust preferred securities.
These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on June 28, 2036, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the debentures purchased by PEBK Trust II, in whole or in part, which became effective on June 28, 2011. As specified in the indenture, if the debentures are redeemed prior to maturity, the redemption price will be the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest.

 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
 AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 The following is a discussion of our financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under Item 1A Risk Factors in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto on pages A-24 through A-68.
 Introduction
Management's discussion and analysis of earnings and related data are presented to assist in understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc. ("Bancorp"), for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Bancorp is a registered bank holding company operating under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board (the "FRB") and the parent company of Peoples Bank (the "Bank"). The Bank is a North Carolina-chartered bank, with offices in Catawba, Lincoln, Alexander, Mecklenburg, Iredell, Wake and Durham counties, operating under the banking laws of North Carolina and the rules and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").
 Overview
Our business consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans and consumer loans. Our profitability depends primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the income we receive on our loan and investment securities portfolios and our cost of funds, which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Net interest income also is affected by the relative amounts of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. When interest-earning assets approximate or exceed interest-bearing liabilities, a positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income. Our profitability is also affected by the level of other income and operating expenses. Other income consists primarily of miscellaneous fees related to our loans and deposits, mortgage banking income and commissions from sales of annuities and mutual funds. Operating expenses consist of compensation and benefits, occupancy related expenses, federal deposit and other insurance premiums, data processing, advertising and other expenses.
Our operations are influenced significantly by local economic conditions and by policies of financial institution regulatory authorities. The earnings on our assets are influenced by the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), inflation, interest rates, market and monetary fluctuations. Lending activities are affected by the demand for commercial and other types of loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered. Our cost of funds is influenced by interest rates on competing investments and by rates offered on similar investments by competing financial institutions in our market area, as well as general market interest rates. These factors can cause fluctuations in our net interest income and other income. In addition, local economic conditions can impact the credit risk of our loan portfolio, in that (1) local employers may be required to eliminate employment positions of individual borrowers, and (2) small businesses and commercial borrowers may experience a downturn in their operating performance and become unable to make timely payments on their loans. Management evaluates these factors in estimating the allowance for loan losses and changes in these economic factors could result in increases or decreases to the provision for loan losses.
Our business emphasis has been and continues to be to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented financial institution dedicated to providing quality customer service. We are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate. We expect growth to be achieved in our local markets and through expansion opportunities in contiguous or nearby markets. While we would be willing to consider growth by acquisition in certain circumstances, we do not consider the acquisition of another company to be necessary for our continued ability to provide a reasonable return to our shareholders. We believe that we can be more effective in serving our customers than many of our non-local competitors because of our ability to quickly and effectively provide senior management responses to customer needs and inquiries. Our ability to provide these services is enhanced by the stability and experience of our Bank officers and managers.
The Federal Reserve maintained the Federal Funds rate at 0.25% from December 2008 to December 2015 before increasing the Fed Funds rate nine times since December 2015 to the Fed Funds rate of 2.50% at December 31, 2018. These increases have had a positive impact on earnings in recent periods and should continue to have a positive impact on the Bank's net interest income in future periods.
The Company plans to open a Loan Production Office in the Ballantyne area of Charlotte, North Carolina during 2019. The Company does not have specific plans for additional offices in 2019 but will continue to look for growth opportunities in nearby markets and may expand if considered a worthwhile opportunity.
A-4
On August 31, 2015, the FDIC and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks ("Commissioner") issued a Consent Order (the "Order") in connection with compliance by the Bank with the Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations (collectively, the "BSA"). The Order was issued pursuant to the consent of the Bank. In consenting to the issuance of the Order, the Bank did not admit or deny any unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation.
The Order required the Bank to take certain affirmative actions to comply with its obligations under the BSA, including, without limitation, strengthening its Board of Directors' oversight of BSA activities; reviewing, enhancing, adopting and implementing a revised BSA compliance program; completing a BSA risk assessment; developing a revised system of internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with the BSA;reviewing and revising customer due diligence and risk assessment processes, policies and procedures; developing, adopting and implementing effective BSA training programs; assessing BSA staffing needs and resources and appointing a qualified BSA officer;establishing an independent BSA testing program; ensuring that all reports required by the BSA are accurately and properly filed and engaging an independent firm to review past account activity to determine whether suspicious activity was properly identified and reported.
During the third quarter of 2017 the Bank received notice that the Order was terminated effective August 30, 2017.
 Summary of Significant and Critical Accounting Policies
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, along with the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries, Peoples Investment Services, Inc., Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc. ("REAS"), Community Bank Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("CBRES") and PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC (collectively called the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company's accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition. Many of the Company's accounting policies require significant judgment regarding valuation of assets and liabilities and/or significant interpretation of specific accounting guidance. The following is a summary of some of the more subjective and complex accounting policies of the Company. A more complete description of the Company's significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders which is Appendix A to the Proxy Statement for the May 2, 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The allowance for loan losses reflects management's assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank periodically analyzes the loan portfolio in an effort to review asset quality and to establish an allowance for loan losses that management believes will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses.
Many of the Company's assets and liabilities are recorded using various techniques that require significant judgment as to recoverability. The collectability of loans is reflected through the Company's estimate of the allowance for loan losses. The Company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolio to assess overall collectability. In addition, certain assets and liabilities are reflected at their estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Such amounts are based on either quoted market prices or estimated values derived from dealer quotes used by the Company, market comparisons or internally generated modeling techniques. The Company's internal models generally involve present value of cash flow techniques. The various techniques are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this management's discussion and analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
There are other complex accounting standards that require the Company to employ significant judgment in interpreting and applying certain of the principles prescribed by those standards. These judgments include, but are not limited to, the determination of whether a financial instrument or other contract meets the definition of a derivative in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
The disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities are intended to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The disclosure requirements include qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses, on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.
A-5
The Company has an overall interest rate risk management strategy that has, in prior years, incorporated the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. When using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk is equal to the extent of the fair-value gain in the derivative. The Company minimized the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that were reviewed periodically by the Company. The Company did not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2018 or 2017.
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 Results of Operations
Summary. The Company reported earnings of $13.4 million or $2.23 basic net earnings per share and $2.22 diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.3 million or $1.71 basic net earnings per share and $1.69 diluted net earnings per share for the same period one year ago. The increase in year-to-date net earnings is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in income tax expense, which were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, as discussed below.
The Company reported earnings of $10.3 million or $1.71 basic net earnings per share and $1.69 diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $9.2 million or $1.53 basic net earnings per share and $1.50 diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in year-to-date net earnings from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in non-interest expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income and a decrease in the credit to the provision for loan losses, as discussed below. Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 were reduced by a charge to income tax expense of $588,000 due to the revaluation of deferred taxes as required due to the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") in December, 2017. Without this charge to earnings, the Company would have had net earnings totaling $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The return on average assets in 2018 was 1.22%, compared to 0.93% in 2017 and 0.85% in 2016. The return on average shareholders' equity was 10.81% in 2018 compared to 8.78% in 2017 and 8.11% in 2016.
Net Interest Income. Net interest income, the major component of the Company's net income, is the amount by which interest and fees generated by interest-earning assets exceed the total cost of funds used to carry them. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned and rates paid. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest income by average interest-earning assets, and represents the Company's net yield on its interest-earning assets.
Net interest income for 2018 was $43.2 million compared to $39.6 million in 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in interest income, which was primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and a 1.00% increase in the prime rate since December 31, 2017, combined with a $231,000 decrease in interest expense, which was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average outstanding balances of Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period one year ago due to the payoff of remaining FHLB borrowings in October 2017. Net interest income increased to $39.6 million in 2017 from $36.5 million in 2016.
Table 1 sets forth for each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amounts outstanding, the interest incurred on such amounts and the average rate earned or incurred for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The table also sets forth the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets, the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities, and the net yield on total average interest-earning assets for the same periods. Yield information does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of shareholders' equity. Yields and interest income on tax-exempt investments have been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using an effective tax rate of 22.98% for securities that are both federal and state tax exempt and an effective tax rate of 20.48% for federal tax exempt securities. Non-accrual loans and the interest income that was recorded on non-accrual loans, if any, are included in the yield calculations for loans in all periods reported.

*Includes U.S. Government agency securities that are non-taxable for state income tax purposes of $38.0 million in 2018, $40.3 million in 2017 and $38.7 million in 2016. The tax rates of 2.50%, 3.00% and 4.00% were used to calculate the tax equivalent yields on these securities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Changes in interest income and interest expense can result from variances in both volume and rates. Table 2 describes the impact on the Company's tax equivalent net interest income resulting from changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated. The changes in interest due to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume and rate changes in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each.

[END TABLE]
Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled $44.3 million in 2018 as compared to $41.7 million in 2017. The net interest rate spread, which represents the rate earned on interest-earning assets less the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 4.29% in 2018, as compared to a net interest rate spread of 4.08% in 2017. The net yield on interest-earning assets was 4.39% in 2018 and 4.18% in 2017.
Tax equivalent interest income increased $2.3 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in the average outstanding principal balance of loans, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities. The average outstanding principal balance of loans increased $35.4 million to $777.1 million in 2018 compared to $741.7 million in 2017. The average outstanding balance of investment securities decreased $23.5 million to $213.9 million in 2018 compared to $237.4 million in 2017. The yield on interest-earning assets was 4.61% in 2018 compared to 4.42% in 2017.
Interest expense decreased $231,000 in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance of FHLB borrowings. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $35.4 million to $665.2 million in 2018 compared to $700.6 million in 2017. The cost of funds decreased to 0.32% in 2018 from 0.34% in 2017.
In 2017 net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was $41.7 million compared to $38.8 million in 2016. The net interest spread was 4.08% in 2017 compared to 3.81% in 2016. The net yield on interest-earning assets was 4.18% in 2017 compared to 3.94% in 2016.
Provision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to income in order to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management of the Company based on factors such as management's judgment as to losses within the Bank's loan portfolio, including the valuation of impaired loans, loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies and management's assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio and general economic climate.
The provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an expense of $790,000, as compared to a credit of $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily attributable to a $44.2 million increase in loans from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. The credits to provision for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 resulted from, and were considered appropriate as part of, management's assessment and estimate of the risks in the total loan portfolio and determination of the total allowance for loan losses. The primary factors contributing to the continued decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding were the continuing positive trends in indicators of potential losses on loans, primarily non-accrual loans and the reduction in the level of net charge-offs since 2014, as shown in Table 3 below:

(1) The loss ratio for consumer loans is elevated because overdraft charge-offs related to DDA and NOW accounts are reported in consumer loan charge-offs and recoveries. The net overdraft charge-offs are not considered material and are therefore not shown separately.

Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $893,000 increase in miscellaneous non-interest income, which was partially offset by a $339,000 decrease in mortgage banking income during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in miscellaneous non-interest income is primarily due to a $576,000 increase in net gains associated with the disposal of premises and equipment, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in mortgage banking income is primarily due to a decrease in mortgage loan volume resulting from an increase in mortgage loan rates.
Non-interest income was $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-interest income is primarily attributable to a $729,000 decrease in gains on the sale of securities, a $341,000 decrease in service charges and fees and a $238,000 decrease in mortgage banking income during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
 The Company periodically evaluates its investments for any impairment which would be deemed other-than-temporary.   No investment impairments were deemed other-than-temporary in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense was $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in salaries and benefits expense and a $469,000 increase in occupancy expense, which were partially offset by decreases in adverting expense, debit card expense and other non-interest expense, during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees and annual salary increases. The increase in occupancy expense is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.
Non-interest expense was $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in professional fees and a $878,000 decrease in other non-interest expense, which were partially offset by a $794,000 increase in salaries and benefits expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in professional fees is primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in consulting fees resulting from the termination of the Order. The decrease in other non-interest expense is primarily due to a $752,000 decrease in FHLB prepayment penalties and the increase in salaries and benefits expense is primarily due to an increase in the number of full-time equivalent employees, annual salary increases and an increase in expenses associated with restricted stock units due to an increase in the Company's stock price.

Income Taxes. The Company reported income tax expense of $2.6 million, $3.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates were 16.39%, 28.03% and 21.82% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $588,000 additional tax expense due to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset as a result of the TCJA, which reduced the Company's federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
Liquidity. The objectives of the Company's liquidity policy are to provide for the availability of adequate funds to meet the needs of loan demand, deposit withdrawals, maturing liabilities and to satisfy regulatory requirements. Both deposit and loan customer cash needs can fluctuate significantly depending upon business cycles, economic conditions and yields and returns available from alternative investment opportunities. In addition, the Company's liquidity is affected by off-balance sheet commitments to lend in the form of unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, such unfunded commitments to extend credit were $268.7 million, while commitments in the form of standby letters of credit totaled $3.7 million.
The Company uses several funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. The primary funding source is core deposits, which includes demand deposits, savings accounts and non-brokered certificates of deposits of denominations less than $250,000. The Company considers these to be a stable portion of the Company's liability mix and the result of on-going consumer and commercial banking relationships. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's core deposits totaled $859.2 million, or 98% of total deposits.
The Bank has a line of credit with the FHLB equal to 20% of the Bank's total assets, with no balances outstanding at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral totaled approximately $140.0 million. The remaining availability under the line of credit with the FHLB was $84.9 million at December 31, 2018. The Bank had no borrowings from the FRB at December 31, 2018. The FRB borrowings are collateralized by a blanket assignment on all qualifying loans that the Bank owns which are not pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral to the FRB totaled approximately $442.6 million.
The Bank also had the ability to borrow up to $82.5 million for the purchase of overnight federal funds from six correspondent financial institutions as of December 31, 2018.
The liquidity ratio for the Bank, which is defined as net cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold and certain investment securities, as a percentage of net deposits and short-term liabilities was 16.09%, 20.62% and 24.78% at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The minimum required liquidity ratio as defined in the Bank's Asset/Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management Policy for on balance sheet liquidity was 10% at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
As disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere herein, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $17.2 million during 2018. Net cash used in investing activities was $18.6 million during 2018 and net cash used by financing activities was $12.5 million during 2018.
Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management. The objective of the Company's Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk strategies is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates and to minimize the interest rate risk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at various maturities. This is done in conjunction with the need to maintain adequate liquidity and the overall goal of maximizing net interest income. Table 6 presents an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO") of the Bank. The ALCO meets quarterly and has the responsibility for approving asset/liability management policies, formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and/or earnings and reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of the Company. ALCO tries to minimize interest rate risk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities by attempting to minimize wide fluctuations in net interest income due to interest rate movements. The ability to control these fluctuations has a direct impact on the profitability of the Company. Management monitors this activity on a regular basis through analysis of its portfolios to determine the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities.
The Company's rate sensitive assets are those earning interest at variable rates and those with contractual maturities within one year. Rate sensitive assets therefore include both loans and available for sale ("AFS") securities. Rate sensitive liabilities include interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, time deposits and borrowed funds. At December 31, 2018, rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities totaled $1.0 billion and $657.1 million, respectively.
Included in the rate sensitive assets are $279.1 million in variable rate loans indexed to prime rate subject to immediate repricing upon changes by the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC"). The Bank utilizes interest rate floors on certain variable rate loans to protect against further downward movements in the prime rate. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $161.4 million in loans with interest rate floors. The floors were in effect on $2.5 million of these loans pursuant to the terms of the promissory notes on these loans. The weighted average rate on these loans is 0.47% higher than the indexed rate on the promissory notes without interest rate floors.
An analysis of the Company's financial condition and growth can be made by examining the changes and trends in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. A discussion of these changes and trends follows.
 Analysis of Financial Condition
Investment Securities. The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects the Company's investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits.
All of the Company's investment securities are held in the AFS category. At December 31, 2018, the market value of AFS securities totaled $194.6 million, compared to $229.3 million and $249.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Table 7 presents the fair value of the AFS securities held at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Loans. The loan portfolio is the largest category of the Company's earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans and consumer loans. The Bank grants loans and extensions of credit primarily within the Catawba Valley region of North Carolina, which encompasses Catawba, Alexander, Iredell and Lincoln counties and also in Mecklenburg, Wake and Durham counties in North Carolina.
Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, which is dependent upon the real estate market. Real estate mortgage loans include both commercial and residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $102.1 million in residential mortgage loans, $106.9 million in home equity loans and $376.6 million in commercial mortgage loans, which include $300.3 million secured by commercial property and $76.3 million secured by residential property. Residential mortgage loans include $34.3 million in non-traditional mortgage loans from the former Banco division of the Bank. All residential mortgage loans are originated as fully amortizing loans, with no negative amortization.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $94.1 million in construction and land development loans. Table 9 presents a breakout of these loans.

The mortgage loans originated in the traditional banking offices are generally 15 to 30 year fixed rate loans with attributes that prevent the loans from being sellable in the secondary market. These factors may include higher loan-to-value ratio, limited documentation on income, non-conforming appraisal or non-conforming property type. These loans are generally made to existing Bank customers and have been originated throughout the Bank's seven county service area, with no geographic concentration.
The composition of the Bank's loan portfolio at December 31 is presented in Table 10.

In the normal course of business, there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements. At December 31, 2018, outstanding loan commitments totaled $272.4 million. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Additional information regarding commitments is provided below in the section entitled "Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" and in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses reflects management's assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank periodically analyzes the loan portfolio in an effort to review asset quality and to establish an allowance for loan losses that management believes will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses. In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, size, quality and risk of loans in the portfolio are reviewed. Other factors considered are:
 the Bank's loan loss experience;
 the amount of past due and non-performing loans;
 specific known risks;
 the status and amount of other past due and non-performing assets;
 underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans;
 current and anticipated economic conditions; and
 other factors which management believes affect the allowance for potential credit losses.
Management uses several measures to assess and monitor the credit risks in the loan portfolio, including a loan grading system that begins upon loan origination and continues until the loan is collected or collectability becomes doubtful. Upon loan origination, the Bank's originating loan officer evaluates the quality of the loan and assigns one of eight risk grades. The loan officer monitors the loan's performance and credit quality and makes changes to the credit grade as conditions warrant. When originated or renewed, all loans over a certain dollar amount receive in-depth reviews and risk assessments by the Bank's Credit Administration. Before making any changes in these risk grades, management considers assessments as determined by the third party credit review firm (as described below), regulatory examiners and the Bank's Credit Administration. Any issues regarding the risk assessments are addressed by the Bank's senior credit administrators and factored into management's decision to originate or renew the loan. The Bank's Board of Directors reviews, on a monthly basis, an analysis of the Bank's reserves relative to the range of reserves estimated by the Bank's Credit Administration.
A-15
As an additional measure, the Bank engages an independent third party to review the underwriting, documentation and risk grading analyses. This independent third party reviews and evaluates loan relationships greater than $1.0 million, excluding loans in default, and loans in process of litigation or liquidation. The third party's evaluation and report is shared with management and the Bank's Board of Directors.
Management considers certain commercial loans with weak credit risk grades to be individually impaired and measures such impairment based upon available cash flows and the value of the collateral. Allowance or reserve levels are estimated for all other graded loans in the portfolio based on their assigned credit risk grade, type of loan and other matters related to credit risk.
Management uses the information developed from the procedures described above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio. This continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses charged or credited to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level appropriate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The amount each quarter is dependent upon many factors, including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-offs, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan portfolio quality, the value of collateral, and other macro-economic factors and trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is comprised of three components: specific reserves, general reserves and unallocated reserves. After a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment. When the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve. These specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis based on management's current evaluation of the Bank's loss exposure for each credit, given the appraised value of any underlying collateral. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general allowance calculations as described below.
The general allowance reflects reserves established under GAAP for collective loan impairment. These reserves are based upon historical net charge-offs using the greater of the last two, three, four or five years' loss experience. This charge-off experience may be adjusted to reflect the effects of current conditions. The Bank considers information derived from its loan risk ratings and external data related to industry and general economic trends in establishing reserves.
The unallocated allowance is determined through management's assessment of probable losses that are in the portfolio but are not adequately captured by the other two components of the allowance, including consideration of current economic and business conditions and regulatory requirements. The unallocated allowance also reflects management's acknowledgement of the imprecision and subjectivity that underlie the modeling of credit risk. Due to the subjectivity involved in determining the overall allowance, including the unallocated portion, the unallocated portion may fluctuate from period to period based on management's evaluation of the factors affecting the assumptions used in calculating the allowance.
There were no significant changes in the estimation methods or fundamental assumptions used in the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Revisions, estimates and assumptions may be made in any period in which the supporting factors indicate that loss levels may vary from the previous estimates.
Effective December 31, 2012, certain mortgage loans from the former Banco division of the Bank were analyzed separately from other single family residential loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. These loans are first mortgage loans made to the Latino market, primarily in Mecklenburg, North Carolina and surrounding counties. These loans are non-traditional mortgages in that the customer normally did not have a credit history, so all credit information was accumulated by the loan officers.
Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Management believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to GAAP, and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. Although management uses the best information available to make evaluations, significant future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, thus adversely affecting the operating results of the Company.

Net charge-offs for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $711,000, $677,000 and $833,000, respectively. The ratio of net charge-offs to average total loans was 0.09% in 2018, 0.09% in 2017 and 0.12% in 2016. The Bank strives to proactively work with its customers to identify potential problems. If found, the Bank works to quickly recognize identifiable losses and to establish a plan, with the borrower, if possible, to have the loans paid off. This process of early identification increased the levels of charge-offs and provision for loan losses in 2009 through 2013 as compared to historical periods prior to 2009. The years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 saw net charge-offs at historically low levels.. The current level of past due and non-accrual loans currently indicate that net charge-offs may remain near these historical lows. The allowance for loan losses was $6.4 million or 0.80% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2018. For December 31, 2017 and 2016, the allowance for loan losses amounted to $6.4 million or 0.84% of total loans outstanding and $7.6 million, or 1.04% of total loans outstanding, respectively.

Non-performing Assets. Non-performing assets were $3.3 million or 0.31% of total assets at December 31, 2018, compared to $3.8 million or 0.35% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans include $3.2 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, $1,000 in construction and land development loans and $99,000 in other loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.6 million in commercial and residential mortgage loans, $14,000 in construction and land development loans and $112,000 in other loans at December 31, 2017. Other real estate owned totaled $27,000 and $118,000 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Bank had no repossessed assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had non-performing loans, defined as non-accrual and accruing loans past due more than 90 days, of $3.3 million or 0.41% of total loans. Non-performing loans at December 31, 2017 were $3.7 million or 0.49% of total loans.
Management continually monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that all loans potentially having a material adverse impact on future operating results, liquidity or capital resources have been classified as non-performing. Should economic conditions deteriorate, the inability of distressed customers to service their existing debt could cause higher levels of non-performing loans. Management expects the level of non-accrual loans to continue to be in-line with the level of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
It is the general policy of the Bank to stop accruing interest income when a loan is placed on non-accrual status and any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current income. Generally a loan is placed on non-accrual status when it is over 90 days past due and there is reasonable doubt that all principal will be collected.
A summary of non-performing assets at December 31 for each of the years presented is shown in Table 14.

Deposits. The Company primarily uses deposits to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Company offers a variety of deposit accounts to individuals and businesses. Deposit accounts include checking, savings, money market and time deposits. As of December 31, 2018, total deposits were $877.2 million, compared to $907.0 million at December 31, 2017.  Core deposits, which include demand deposits, savings accounts and non-brokered certificates of deposits of denominations less than $250,000, amounted to $859.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $887.4 million at December 31, 2017.
Time deposits in amounts of $250,000 or more totaled $16.2 million and $18.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, brokered deposits amounted to $3.4 million as compared to $5.2 million at December 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit participated through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ("CDARS") included in brokered deposits amounted to $3.4 million and $5.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Brokered deposits are generally considered to be more susceptible to withdrawal as a result of interest rate changes and to be a less stable source of funds, as compared to deposits from the local market. Brokered deposits outstanding as of December 31, 2018 have a weighted average rate of 0.07% with a weighted average original term of 41 months.

Borrowed Funds. The Company has access to various short-term borrowings, including the purchase of federal funds and borrowing arrangements from the FHLB and other financial institutions. There were no FHLB borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Average FHLB borrowings for 2018 and 2017 were zero and $16.3 million, respectively. The maximum amount of outstanding FHLB borrowings was $20.0 million in 2017. Additional information regarding FHLB borrowings is provided in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Bank had no borrowings from the FRB at December 31, 2018 and 2017. FRB borrowings are collateralized by a blanket assignment on all qualifying loans that the Bank owns which are not pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral totaled approximately $442.6 million.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $58.1 million at December 31, 2018, as compared to $37.8 million at December 31, 2017.
Junior subordinated debentures were $20.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company's contractual obligations and other commitments as of December 31, 2018 are summarized in Table 16 below. The Company's contractual obligations include junior subordinated debentures, as well as certain payments under current lease agreements. Other commitments include commitments to extend credit. Because not all of these commitments to extend credit will be drawn upon, the actual cash requirements are likely to be significantly less than the amounts reported for other commitments below.

               The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage various financial risks. A derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows, and therefore its value, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date. Derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts, which only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and are not a measure of financial risk. Therefore, the derivative amounts recorded on the balance sheet do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts. Further discussions of derivative instruments are included above in the section entitled "Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management" beginning on page A-11 and in Notes 1, 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no derivatives at December 31, 2018 or 2017.

Capital Resources. Shareholders' equity was $123.6 million, or 11.31% of total assets, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $116.0 million, or 10.62% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders' equity is primarily due to an increase in retained earnings due to net income.
Average shareholders' equity as a percentage of total average assets is one measure used to determine capital strength. Average shareholders' equity as a percentage of total average assets was 11.31%, 10.64% and 10.51% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The return on average shareholders' equity was 10.81% at December 31, 2018 as compared to 8.78% and 8.11% at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Total cash dividends paid on common stock were $3.1 million, $2.6 million and $2.1 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The Company did not pay any dividends on preferred stock during 2018 and 2017.
The Board of Directors, at its discretion, can issue shares of preferred stock up to a maximum of 5,000,000 shares. The Board is authorized to determine the number of shares, voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights.
In 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which up to $2.0 million was allocated to repurchase the Company's common stock. Any purchases under the Company's stock repurchase program were made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any repurchase of shares were determined by the Company's management, based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Company has repurchased approximately $2.0 million, or 92,738 shares of its common stock, under this program as of December 31, 2017.
In 2013, the FRB approved its final rule on the Basel III capital standards, which implement changes to the regulatory capital framework for banking organizations. The Basel III capital standards, which became effective January 1, 2015, include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in from 2015 to 2019. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the final rules are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% (unchanged from previous rules). An additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and is being phased in through 2019 (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules, institutions would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained earnings that could be utilized for such actions.
Under the regulatory capital guidelines, financial institutions are currently required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, with a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, as required by the Basel III capital standards referenced above. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as shareholders' equity and trust preferred securities less all intangible assets and goodwill. Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 includes $20.0 million in trust preferred securities. The Company's Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.46% and 15.32% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Total risk-based capital is defined as Tier 1 capital plus supplementary capital. Supplementary capital, or Tier 2 capital, consists of the Company's allowance for loan losses, not exceeding 1.25% of the Company's risk-weighted assets. Total risk-based capital ratio is therefore defined as the ratio of total capital (Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets. The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 16.15% and 16.06% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Company's common equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock and retained earnings. The Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.29% and 13.00% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Financial institutions are also required to maintain a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets of 4.0% or greater. The Company's Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 13.05% and 11.94% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
The Bank's Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 15.21% and 15.09% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The total risk-based capital ratio for the Bank was 15.91% and 15.83% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.21% and 15.09% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The Bank's Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 12.76% and 11.69% at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
A- A bank is considered to be "well capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. Based upon these guidelines, the Bank was considered to be "well capitalized" at December 31, 2018.
The Company's key equity ratios as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented in Table 17.

 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished current market values or reduced potential net interest income in future periods.
The Company's market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities. The structure of the Company's loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline (increase) in interest rates may adversely (positively) impact net market values and interest income. Management seeks to manage the risk through the utilization of its investment securities and off-balance sheet derivative instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company used interest rate contracts to manage market risk as discussed above in the section entitled "Asset Liability and Interest Rate Risk Management."
Table 19 presents in tabular form the contractual balances and the estimated fair value of the Company's on-balance sheet financial instruments at their expected maturity dates for the period ended December 31, 2018. The expected maturity categories take into consideration historical prepayment experience as well as management's expectations based on the interest rate environment at December 31, 2018. For core deposits without contractual maturity (i.e. interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts), the table presents principal cash flows based on management's judgment concerning their most likely runoff or repricing behaviors.

Table 20 presents the simulated impact to net interest income under varying interest rate scenarios and the theoretical impact of rate changes over a twelve-month period referred to as "rate ramps." The table shows the estimated theoretical impact on the Company's tax equivalent net interest income from hypothetical rate changes of plus and minus 1%, 2% and 3% as compared to the estimated theoretical impact of rates remaining unchanged. The table also shows the simulated impact to market value of equity under varying interest rate scenarios and the theoretical impact of immediate and sustained rate changes referred to as "rate shocks" of plus and minus 1%, 2% and 3% as compared to the theoretical impact of rates remaining unchanged. The prospective effects of the hypothetical interest rate changes are based upon various assumptions, including relative and estimated levels of key interest rates. This type of modeling has limited usefulness because it does not allow for the strategies management would utilize in response to sudden and sustained rate changes. Also, management does not believe that rate changes of the magnitude presented are likely in the forecast period presented.

A-  Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
 A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 Organization
Peoples Bancorp of North Carolina, Inc. ("Bancorp") received regulatory approval to operate as a bank holding company on July 22, 1999, and became effective August 31, 1999. Bancorp is primarily regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and serves as the one-bank holding company for Peoples Bank (the "Bank").
The Bank commenced business in 1912 upon receipt of its banking charter from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (the "Commissioner"). The Bank is primarily regulated by the Commissioner and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and undergoes periodic examinations by these regulatory agencies. The Bank, whose main office is in Newton, North Carolina, provides a full range of commercial and consumer banking services primarily in Catawba, Alexander, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Iredell, Wake and Durham counties in North Carolina.
Peoples Investment Services, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and began operations in 1996 to provide investment and trust services through agreements with an outside party.
Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc. ("REAS") is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and began operations in 1997 to provide real estate appraisal and property management services to individuals and commercial customers of the Bank.
Community Bank Real Estate Solutions, LLC ("CBRES") is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and began operations in 2009 as a "clearing house" for appraisal services for community banks. Other banks are able to contract with CBRES to find and engage appropriate appraisal companies in the area where the property is located.
PB Real Estate Holdings, LLC ("PBREH") is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and began operation in 2015. PBREH acquires, manages and disposes of real property, other collateral and other assets obtained in the ordinary course of collecting debts previously contracted.
The Bank operates three banking offices focused on the Latino population that were formerly operated as a division of the Bank under the name Banco de la Gente ("Banco"). These offices are now branded as Bank branches and considered a separate market territory of the Bank as they offer normal and customary banking services as are offered in the Bank's other branches such as the taking of deposits and the making of loans.
 Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank, along with the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries, Peoples Investment Services, Inc., REAS, CBRES and PBREH (collectively called the "Company"). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 Basis of Presentation
The accounting principles followed by the Company, and the methods of applying these principles, conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and with general practices in the banking industry. In preparing the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Material estimates common to the banking industry that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include, but are not limited to, the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of real estate acquired in connection with or in lieu of foreclosure on loans.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash, due from banks and interest-bearing deposits are considered cash and cash equivalents for cash flow reporting purposes.
  A-34
 Investment Securities
There are three classifications the Company is able to classify its investment securities: trading, available for sale, or held to maturity. Trading securities are bought and held principally for sale in the near term. Held to maturity securities are those securities for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company classified all of its investment securities as available for sale.
Available for sale securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized.
Management evaluates investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment on an annual basis. A decline in the market value of any investment below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary is charged to earnings for the decline in value deemed to be credit related and a new cost basis in the security is established. The decline in value attributed to non-credit related factors is recognized in comprehensive income.
Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to the yield. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available for sale are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold.
 Other Investments
Other investments include equity securities with no readily determinable fair value. These investments are carried at cost.
 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at lower of aggregate cost or market value. The cost of mortgage loans held for sale approximates the market value.
 Loans
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for loan losses. Interest on loans is calculated by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding. The recognition of certain loan origination fee income and certain loan origination costs is deferred when such loans are originated and amortized over the life of the loan.
A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or at the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. Interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period earnings.
 Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses reflects management's assessment and estimate of the risks associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank periodically analyzes the loan portfolio in an effort to review asset quality and to establish an allowance for loan losses that management believes will be adequate in light of anticipated risks and loan losses. In assessing the adequacy of the allowance, size, quality and risk of loans in the portfolio are reviewed. Other factors considered are:
 the Bank's loan loss experience;
 the amount of past due and non-performing loans;
 specific known risks;
 the status and amount of other past due and non-performing assets;
 underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans;
 current and anticipated economic conditions; and
 other factors which management believes affect the allowance for potential credit losses.
A-35
Management uses several measures to assess and monitor the credit risks in the loan portfolio, including a loan grading system that begins upon loan origination and continues until the loan is collected or collectability becomes doubtful. Upon loan origination, the Bank's originating loan officer evaluates the quality of the loan and assigns one of eight risk grades. The loan officer monitors the loan's performance and credit quality and makes changes to the credit grade as conditions warrant. When originated or renewed, all loans over a certain dollar amount receive in-depth reviews and risk assessments by the Bank's Credit Administration. Before making any changes in these risk grades, management considers assessments as determined by the third party credit review firm (as described below), regulatory examiners and the Bank's Credit Administration. Any issues regarding the risk assessments are addressed by the Bank's senior credit administrators and factored into management's decision to originate or renew the loan. The Bank's Board of Directors reviews, on a monthly basis, an analysis of the Bank's reserves relative to the range of reserves estimated by the Bank's Credit Administration.
As an additional measure, the Bank engages an independent third party to review the underwriting, documentation and risk grading analyses. This independent third party reviews and evaluates loan relationships greater than $1.0 million, excluding loans in default, and loans in process of litigation or liquidation. The third party's evaluation and report is shared with management and the Bank's Board of Directors.
Management considers certain commercial loans with weak credit risk grades to be individually impaired and measures such impairment based upon available cash flows and the value of the collateral. Allowance or reserve levels are estimated for all other graded loans in the portfolio based on their assigned credit risk grade, type of loan and other matters related to credit risk.
Management uses the information developed from the procedures described above in evaluating and grading the loan portfolio. This continual grading process is used to monitor the credit quality of the loan portfolio and to assist management in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses charged or credited to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level appropriate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The amount each quarter is dependent upon many factors, including growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, net charge-offs, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan portfolio quality, the value of collateral, and other macro-economic factors and trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed quarterly by management through an analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is comprised of three components: specific reserves, general reserves and unallocated reserves. After a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment. When the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve. These specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis based on management's current evaluation of the Bank's loss exposure for each credit, given the appraised value of any underlying collateral. Loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general allowance calculations as described below.
The general allowance reflects reserves established under GAAP for collective loan impairment. These reserves are based upon historical net charge-offs using the greater of the last two, three, four or five years' loss experience. This charge-off experience may be adjusted to reflect the effects of current conditions. The Bank considers information derived from its loan risk ratings and external data related to industry and general economic trends in establishing reserves.
The unallocated allowance is determined through management's assessment of probable losses that are in the portfolio but are not adequately captured by the other two components of the allowance, including consideration of current economic and business conditions and regulatory requirements. The unallocated allowance also reflects management's acknowledgement of the imprecision and subjectivity that underlie the modeling of credit risk. Due to the subjectivity involved in determining the overall allowance, including the unallocated portion, the unallocated portion may fluctuate from period to period based on management's evaluation of the factors affecting the assumptions used in calculating the allowance.
There were no significant changes in the estimation methods or fundamental assumptions used in the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Revisions, estimates and assumptions may be made in any period in which the supporting factors indicate that loss levels may vary from the previous estimates.
A-36
Effective December 31, 2012, certain mortgage loans from the former Banco division of the Bank were analyzed separately from other single family residential loans in the Bank's loan portfolio. These loans are first mortgage loans made to the Latino market, primarily in Mecklenburg, North Carolina and surrounding counties. These loans are non-traditional mortgages in that the customer normally did not have a credit history, so all credit information was accumulated by the loan officers.
Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank's allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations. Management believes it has established the allowance for credit losses pursuant to GAAP, and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover the estimated losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements. Although management uses the best information available to make evaluations, significant future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions, thus adversely affecting the operating results of the Company.
 Mortgage Banking Activities
Mortgage banking income represents net gains from the sale of mortgage loans and fees received from borrowers and loan investors related to the Bank's origination of single-family residential mortgage loans.
Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the accompanying balance sheets. The unpaid principal balances of mortgage loans serviced for others was approximately $866,000, $1.0 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Bank originates certain fixed rate mortgage loans and commits these loans for sale. The commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans and the commitments to sell these loans to a third party are both derivative contracts. The fair value of these derivative contracts is immaterial and has no effect on the recorded amounts in the financial statements.
 Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings for that period. The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful life of the respective asset is charged to earnings as incurred, whereas significant renewals and improvements are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives for premises and equipment are generally as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Buildings  and improvements    10 - 50  years  
  Furniture  and equipment    3 - 10  years  
[END TABLE]
 Other Real Estate
Foreclosed assets include all assets received in full or partial satisfaction of a loan. Foreclosed assets are reported at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any write-downs at the time of foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management, and a valuation allowance is established if fair value less estimated selling costs declines below carrying value. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized. Revenues and expenses from operations are included in other expenses. Changes in the valuation allowance are included in loss on sale and write-down of other real estate.
 Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Additionally, the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, is required to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely than not to occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities results in a deferred tax asset, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of  
A-37
the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning  strategies.
Tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company assessed the impact of this guidance and determined that it did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or disclosures.
 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk by modifying the characteristics of the related balance sheet instruments in order to reduce the adverse effect of changes in interest rates. All material derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the financial statements. The fair value of derivative contracts related to the origination of fixed rate mortgage loans and the commitments to sell these loans to a third party is immaterial and has no effect on the recorded amounts in the financial statements.
The disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities have the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The disclosure requirements include qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a trading instrument. Changes in the fair value of instruments used as fair value hedges are accounted for in the earnings of the period simultaneous with accounting for the fair value change of the item being hedged. Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are accounted for in other comprehensive income rather than earnings. Changes in fair value of instruments that are not intended as a hedge are accounted for in the earnings of the period of the change.
If a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the difference between a hedged item's then carrying amount and its face amount is recognized into income over the original hedge period. Likewise, if a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, related amounts accumulated in other accumulated comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings over the original hedge period during which the hedged item affects income.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
The Company formally documents all hedging relationships, including an assessment that the derivative instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.

 Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has an Omnibus Stock Ownership and Long Term Incentive Plan that was approved by shareholders on May 7, 2009 (the "Plan") whereby certain stock-based rights, such as stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, stock appreciation rights or book value shares, may be granted to eligible directors and employees. A total of 280,933 shares are currently reserved for possible issuance under the Plan. All stock-based rights under the Plan must be granted or awarded by May 7, 2019 (i.e., ten years from the Plan effective date).
The Company granted 32,465 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $7.18 per share during the first quarter of 2012, of which 5,891 restricted stock units were forfeited by the executive officers of the Company as required by the agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury in conjunction with the Company's participation in the Capital Purchase Program under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In July 2012, the Company granted 5,891 restricted stock units at a grant date fair value of $7.50 per share. The Company granted 29,475 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $10.82 per share during the second quarter of 2013. The Company granted 23,162 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $14.27 per share during the first quarter of 2014. The Company granted 16,583 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $16.34 per share during the first quarter of 2015. The Company granted 5,544 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $16.91 per share during the first quarter of 2016. The Company granted 4,114 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $25.00 per share during the first quarter of 2017. The Company granted 3,725 restricted stock units under the Plan at a grant date fair value of $31.43 per share during the first quarter of 2018. The number of restricted stock units granted and grant date fair values have been restated to reflect the 10% stock dividend during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company recognizes compensation expense on the restricted stock units over the period of time the restrictions are in place (five years from the grant date for the 2012 grants, four years from the grant date for the 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 grants and three years from the grant date for the 2014 grants). The amount of expense recorded each period reflects the changes in the Company's stock price during such period. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock unit grants under the Plan was $165,000.
The Company recognized compensation expense for restricted stock units granted under the Plan of $85,000, $592,000 and $932,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Net Earnings Per Share
Net earnings per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per common share. The average market price during the year is used to compute equivalent shares.
The reconciliations of the amounts used in the computation of both "basic earnings per common share" and "diluted earnings per common share" for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

A-41
 ASU 2014-09
The Company has applied ASU 2014-09 using a modified retrospective approach. The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income. The scope of ASU 2014-09 explicitly excludes net interest income as well as many other revenues for financial assets and liabilities including loans, leases, securities, and derivatives. Accordingly, the majority of the Company's revenues are not affected. Appraisal management fee income and expense from the Bank's subsidiary, CBRES, was reported as a net amount prior to March 31, 2018, which was included in miscellaneous non-interest income. This income and expense is now reported on separate line items under non-interest income and non-interest expense. See below for additional information related to revenue generated from contracts with customers.
 Revenue and Method of Adoption
The majority of the Company's revenue is derived primarily from interest income from receivables (loans) and securities. Other revenues are derived from fees received in connection with deposit accounts, investment advisory, and appraisal services. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective transition approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. The method was selected as there were no material changes in the timing of revenue recognition resulting in no comparability issues with prior periods. This adoption method is considered a change in accounting principle requiring additional disclosure of the nature of and reason for the change, which is solely a result of the adoption of the required standard. When applying the modified retrospective approach under ASU 2014-09, the Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to apply this approach only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. A completed contract is considered to be a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized in accordance with revenue guidance that was in effect before January 1, 2018. There were no uncompleted contracts as of January 1, 2018 for which application of the new standard required an adjustment to retained earnings.
The following disclosures involve the Company's material income streams derived from contracts with customers which are within the scope of ASU 2014-09. Through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, PIS, the Company contracts with a registered investment advisor to perform investment advisory services on behalf of the Company's customers. The Company receives commissions from this third party investment advisor based on the volume of business that the Company's customers do with such investment advisor. Total revenue recognized from these contracts for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $823,000. The Company utilizes third parties to contract with the Company's customers to perform debit and credit card clearing services. These third parties pay the Company commissions based on the volume of transactions that they process on behalf of the Company's customers. Total revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the contract with these third parties was $3.9 million. Through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, REAS, the Company provides property appraisal services for negotiated fee amounts on a per appraisal basis. Total revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 from these contracts with customers was $597,000. Through the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRES, the Company provides appraisal management services. Total revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 from these contracts with customers was $3.2 million. Due to the nature of the Company's relationship with the customers that the Company provides services, the Company does not incur costs to obtain contracts and there are no material incremental costs to fulfill these contracts that should be capitalized.
Disaggregation of Revenue. The Company's portfolio of services provided to the Company's customers consists of over 50,000 active contracts. The Company has disaggregated revenue according to timing of the transfer of service. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 derived from contracts in which services are transferred at a point in time was approximately $8.5 million. None of the Company's revenue is derived from contracts in which services are transferred over time. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customers. Economic factors impacting the customers could affect the nature, amount, and timing of these cash flows, as unfavorable economic conditions could impair the customers' ability to provide payment for services. For the Company's deposit contracts, this risk is mitigated as the Company generally deducts payments from customers' accounts as services are rendered. For the Company's appraisal services, the risk is mitigated in that the appraisal is not released until payment is received.
              Contract Balances. The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable on the balance sheet. Most contracts call for payment by a charge or deduction to the respective customer account but there are some that require a receipt of payment from the customer.
A-42
customers are billed in advance for services to be performed. These types of contracts would create contract liabilities or deferred revenue, as the customers pay in advance for services. There are no contract liabilities or accounts receivables balances that are material to the Company's balance sheet.
Performance Obligations. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASU 2014-09. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Performance obligations are satisfied as the service is provided to the customer at a point in time. There are no significant financing components in the Company's contracts. Excluding deposit and appraisal service revenues which are primarily billed at a point in time as a fee for services incurred, all other contracts within the scope of ASU 2014-09 contain variable consideration in that fees earned are derived from market values of accounts which determine the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled. The variability is resolved when the services are provided. The contracts do not include obligations for returns, refunds, or warranties. The contracts are specific to the amounts owed to the Company for services performed during a period should the contracts be terminated.
Significant Judgements. All of the Company's contracts create performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time excluding some immaterial deposit revenues. Revenue is recognized as services are billed to the customers. Variable consideration does exist for contracts related to the Company's contract with its registered investment advisor as some revenues earned pursuant to that contract are based on market values of accounts at the end of the period.
The following tables provide a summary of ASU's issued by the FASB that the Company has not adopted as of December 31, 2018, which may impact the Company's financial statements.
 Recently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ASU          Description          Effective Date          Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant  Matters  
    ASU 2016-02: Leases          Increases transparency and comparability among organizations by  recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet  and disclosing key information about leasing  arrangements.          January 1, 2019          The Company expects to adopt this guidance using the modified  retrospective method and practical expedients for transition. The  practical expedients allow the Company to largely account for its  existing leases consistent with current guidance except for the  incremental balance sheet recognition for lessees. The adoption of  this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the  Company's results of operations, financial position or  disclosures. The Company epects to record an increase in assets and  liabilities of approximatley $4.4 million as a result of recording  lease contracts where the Company is lessee and expects to adopt  the new guidance prospectively as of January 1, 2019 and to not  restate comparative periods.  
    ASU 2016-13: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial  Instruments          Provides guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and  modify the impairment model for certain debt  securities.          January 1, 2020 Early adoption permitted          The Company will apply this guidance through a cumulative-effect  adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of  adoption. The Company is still evaluating the impact of this  guidance on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has  formed a Current Expected Credit Losses ("CECL")  committee and implemented a model from a third-party vendor for  running CECL calculations. The Company is currently developing CECL  model assumptions and comparing results to current allowance for  loan loss calculations. The Company plans to run parallel  calculations leading up to the effective date of this guidance to  ensure it is prepared for implementation by the effective date. In  addition to the Company's allowance for loan losses, it will  also record an allowance for credit losses on debt securities  instead of applying the impairment model currently utilized. The  amount of the adjustments will be impacted by each  portfolio's composition and credit quality at the adoption  date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that  time.  
    ASU 2017-04: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill  Impairment          Provides guidance to simplify the accounting related to goodwill  impairment.          January 1, 2020          The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material  impact on the Company's results of operations, financial  position or disclosures.  
    ASU 2017-08: Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt  Securities          Amended the requirements related to the amortization period for  certain purchased callable debt securities held at a  premium.          January 1, 2019          The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material  impact on the Company's results of operations, financial  position or disclosures.

GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. There is a three-level fair value hierarchy for fair value measurements. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The table below presents the balance of securities available for sale, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Fair values of investment securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges when available. If quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined using matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.
The following is an analysis of fair value measurements of investment securities available for sale using Level 3, significant unobservable inputs, for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The above table includes deferred costs, net of deferred fees, totaling $1.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The Bank grants loans and extensions of credit primarily within the Catawba Valley region of North Carolina, which encompasses Catawba, Alexander, Iredell and Lincoln counties and also in Mecklenburg, Wake and Durham counties of North Carolina. Although the Bank has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by improved and unimproved real estate, the value of which is dependent upon the real estate market. Risk characteristics of the major components of the Bank's loan portfolio are discussed below:
A-47
 Construction and land development loans โ The risk of loss is largely dependent on the initial estimate of whether the property's value at completion equals or exceeds the cost of property construction and the availability of take-out financing. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays or cost overruns. If the estimate is inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan, sale of the property, or by seizure of collateral. As of December 31, 2018, construction and land development loans comprised approximately 12% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
 Single-family residential loans โ Declining home sales volumes, decreased real estate values and higher than normal levels of unemployment could contribute to losses on these loans. As of December 31, 2018, single-family residential loans comprised approximately 36% of the Bank's total loan portfolio, including Banco single-family residential non-traditional loans which were approximately 4% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
 Commercial real estate loans โ Repayment is dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. These loans also involve greater risk because they are generally not fully amortizing over a loan period, but rather have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower's ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or timely sell the underlying property. As of December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans comprised approximately 34% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
 Commercial loans โ Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower's business. In addition, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, be difficult to appraise, be illiquid, or fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2018, commercial loans comprised approximately 12% of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on non-accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
The following tables present an age analysis of past due loans, by loan type, as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:

At each reporting period, the Bank determines which loans are impaired. Accordingly, the Bank's impaired loans are reported at their estimated fair value on a non-recurring basis. An allowance for each impaired loan that is collateral-dependent is calculated based on the fair value of its collateral. The fair value of the collateral is based on appraisals performed by REAS, a subsidiary of the Bank. REAS is staffed by certified appraisers that also perform appraisals for other companies. Factors, including the assumptions and techniques utilized by the appraiser, are considered by management. If the recorded investment in the impaired loan exceeds the measure of fair value of the collateral, a valuation allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan losses. An allowance for each impaired loan that is not collateral dependent is calculated based on the present value of projected cash flows. If the recorded investment in the impaired loan exceeds the present value of projected cash flows, a valuation allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan losses. Impaired loans under $250,000 are not individually evaluated for impairment with the exception of the Bank's troubled debt restructured ("TDR") loans in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, which are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $4.8 million and $4.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Accruing impaired loans were $22.8 million and $24.6 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Interest income recognized on accruing impaired loans was $1.3 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No interest income is recognized on non-accrual impaired loans subsequent to their classification as non-accrual.

The Bank utilizes an internal risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 8. These risk grades are evaluated on an ongoing basis. A description of the general characteristics of the eight risk grades is as follows:
 Risk Grade 1 โ Excellent Quality: Loans are well above average quality and a minimal amount of credit risk exists. CD or cash secured loans or properly margined actively traded stock or bond secured loans would fall in this grade.
 Risk Grade 2 โ High Quality: Loans are of good quality with risk levels well within the Company's range of acceptability. The organization or individual is established with a history of successful performance though somewhat susceptible to economic changes.
A-52
 Risk Grade 3 โ Good Quality: Loans of average quality with risk levels within the Company's range of acceptability but higher than normal. This may be a new organization or an existing organization in a transitional phase (e.g. expansion, acquisition, market change).
 Risk Grade 4 โ Management Attention: These loans have higher risk and servicing needs but still are acceptable. Evidence of marginal performance or deteriorating trends is observed. These are not problem credits presently, but may be in the future if the borrower is unable to change its present course.
 Risk Grade 5 โ Watch: These loans are currently performing satisfactorily, but there has been some recent past due history on repayment and there are potential weaknesses that may, if not corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company's position at some future date.
 Risk Grade 6 โ Substandard: A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged (if there is any). There is a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
 Risk Grade 7 โ Doubtful: Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified Substandard, plus the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful is a temporary grade where a loss is expected but is presently not quantified with any degree of accuracy. Once the loss position is determined, the amount is charged off.
 Risk Grade 8 โ Loss: Loans classified as Loss are considered uncollectable and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this worthless loan even though partial recovery may be realized in the future. Loss is a temporary grade until the appropriate authority is obtained to charge the loan off.
The following tables present the credit risk profile of each loan type based on internally assigned risk grades as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank Borrowings
The Bank had no borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2018 and 2017. FHLB borrowings are collateralized by a blanket assignment on all residential first mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and loans secured by multi-family real estate that the Bank owns. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral totaled approximately $140.0 million. The remaining availability under the line of credit with the FHLB was $84.9 million at December 31, 2018.
The Bank is required to purchase and hold certain amounts of FHLB stock in order to obtain FHLB borrowings. No ready market exists for the FHLB stock, and it has no quoted market value. The stock is redeemable at $100 per share subject to certain limitations set by the FHLB. The Bank owned $982,000 and $978,000 of FHLB stock, included in other investments, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Bank prepaid FHLB borrowings totaling $20.0 million in 2017 with prepayment penalties totaling $508,000.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank had no borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB"). FRB borrowings are collateralized by a blanket assignment on all qualifying loans that the Bank owns which are not pledged to the FHLB. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of loans pledged as collateral totaled approximately $442.6 million. Availability under the line of credit with the FRB was $335.8 million at December 31, 2018.

Junior Subordinated Debentures
In June 2006, the Company formed a second wholly owned Delaware statutory trust, PEBK Capital Trust II ("PEBK Trust II"), which issued $20.0 million of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the Company's junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures. All of the common securities of PEBK Trust II are owned by the Company. The proceeds from the issuance of the common securities and the trust preferred securities were used by PEBK Trust II to purchase $20.6 million of junior subordinated debentures of the Company. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures were used to repay in December 2006 the trust preferred securities issued in December 2001 by PEBK Capital Trust, a wholly owned Delaware statutory trust of the Company, and for general purposes. The debentures represent the sole assets of PEBK Trust II. PEBK Trust II is not included in the consolidated financial statements.
A- The trust preferred securities issued by PEBK Trust II accrue and pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 163 basis points. The Company has guaranteed distributions and other payments due on the trust preferred securities to the extent PEBK Trust II does not have funds with which to make the distributions and other payments. The net combined effect of all the documents entered into in connection with the trust preferred securities is that the Company is liable to make the distributions and other payments required on the trust preferred securities.
These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on June 28, 2036, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the debentures purchased by PEBK Trust II, in whole or in part, which became effective on June 28, 2011. As specified in the indenture, if the debentures are redeemed prior to maturity, the redemption price will be the principal amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest.

Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the TCJA. The TCJA includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
The Company recognized the income tax effects of the TCJA in its 2017 financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides SEC staff guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the TCJA was signed into law. As such, the Company's financial results reflect the income tax effects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is complete and provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the TCJA for which the accounting under ASC Topic 740 is incomplete but a reasonable estimate could be determined. The Company did not identify items for which the income tax effects of the TCJA have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of December 31, 2017.
The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:

The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. Accordingly, the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a $588,000 increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a corresponding $588,000 decrease in net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.
The Company has analyzed the tax positions taken or expected to be taken in its tax returns and has concluded that it has no liability related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company's Federal income tax filings for years 2015 through 2018 were at year end 2018 open to audit under statutes of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company's North Carolina income tax returns are currently under audit for tax years 2014-2016, tax years 2017 and 2018 are open to audit under the statutes of limitations by the North Carolina Department of Revenue.

The Bank is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Bank has in particular classes of financial instruments.
The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
In most cases, the Bank requires collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

[END TABLE]
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and because they may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount of $272.4 million does not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to businesses in the Bank's delineated market area. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds real estate, equipment, automobiles and customer deposits as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.
In the normal course of business, the Company is a party (both as plaintiff and defendant) to a number of lawsuits. In the opinion of management and counsel, none of these cases should have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company.
Bancorp and the Bank have employment agreements with certain key employees. The agreements, among other things, include salary, bonus, incentive compensation, and change in control provisions.
 A-58
The Company has $82.5 million available for the purchase of overnight federal funds from six correspondent financial institutions as of December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2017, the Bank committed to invest $3.0 million in an income tax credit partnership owning and developing two multifamily housing developments in Charlotte, North Carolina, with $1.5 million allocated to each property. The Bank has funded $2.4 million of this commitment at December 31, 2018.

Employee and Director Benefit Programs
The Company has a profit sharing and 401(k) plan for the benefit of substantially all employees subject to certain minimum age and service requirements. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company matched employee contributions to a maximum of 4.00% of annual compensation in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Company's contribution pursuant to this formula was approximately $670,000, $622,000 and $565,000 for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Investments of the 401(k) plan are determined by a committee comprised of senior management. No investments in Company stock have been made by the 401(k) plan. Contributions to the 401(k) plan are vested immediately.
In December 2001, the Company initiated a postretirement benefit plan to provide retirement benefits to key officers and its Board of Directors and to provide death benefits for their designated beneficiaries. Under the postretirement benefit plan, the Company purchased life insurance contracts on the lives of the key officers and each director. The increase in cash surrender value of the contracts constitutes the Company's contribution to the postretirement benefit plan each year. Postretirement benefit plan participants are to be paid annual benefits for a specified number of years commencing upon retirement. Expenses incurred for benefits relating to the postretirement benefit plan were approximately $423,000, $411,000 and $428,000 for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The Company is currently paying medical benefits for certain retired employees. The Company did not incur any postretirement medical benefits expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 due to an excess accrual balance.
The following table sets forth the change in the accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's two postretirement benefit plans described above:

Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital in relation to both on- and off-balance sheet items at various risk weights. Total capital consists of two tiers of capital. Tier 1 capital includes common shareholders' equity and trust preferred securities less adjustments for intangible assets. Tier 2 capital consists of the allowance for loan losses, up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and other adjustments. Management believes, as of December 31, 2018, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.
A-  
As of December 31, 2018, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's category.
In 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved its final rule on the Basel III capital standards, which implement changes to the regulatory capital framework for banking organizations. The Basel III capital standards, which became effective January 1, 2015, include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in from 2015 to 2019. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the final rules are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% (unchanged from previous rules). An additional capital conservation buffer was added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and is being phased in through 2019 (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules, institutions would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained earnings that could be utilized for such actions.
The Company's and the Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios are presented below:

Shareholders' Equity
Shareholders' equity was $123.6 million, or 11.31% of total assets, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $116.0 million, or 10.62% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders' equity is primarily due to an increase in retained earnings due to net income.
Annualized return on average equity for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 10.81% compared to 8.78% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Total cash dividends paid on common stock were $3.1 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Board of Directors, at its discretion, can issue shares of preferred stock up to a maximum of 5,000,000 shares. The Board is authorized to determine the number of shares, voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights. The Board of Directors does not currently anticipate issuing shares of preferred stock.
In 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which up to $2 million was allocated to repurchase the Company's common stock. Any purchases under the Company's stock repurchase program were made periodically as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any repurchase of shares were determined by the Company's management, based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Company repurchased approximately $2.0 million, or 92,738 shares of its common stock, under this program as of December 31, 2017.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company is required to disclose fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of the Company's financial instruments are detailed below. Where quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. The use of discounted cash flows can be significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The following disclosures should not be considered a surrogate of the liquidation value of the Company, but rather a good faith estimate of the increase or decrease in the value of financial instruments held by the Company since purchase, origination, or issuance.
The Company groups assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
 Level 1 โ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 โ Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
 Level 3 โ Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
For cash, due from banks and interest-bearing deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are reported in the Level 1 fair value category.
 Investment Securities Available for Sale
Fair values of investment securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges when available. If quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined using matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Fair values for investment securities with quoted market prices are reported in the Level 1 fair value category. Fair value measurements obtained from independent pricing services are reported in the Level 2 fair value category. All other fair value measurements are reported in the Level 3 fair value category.
 Other Investments
For other investments, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Other investments are reported in the Level 3 fair value category.
 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at lower of aggregate cost or market value. The cost of mortgage loans held for sale approximates the market value. Mortgage loans held for sale are reported in the Level 3 fair value category.
A-63 
 Loans
The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. For variable rate loans, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Loans are reported in the Level 3 fair value category, as the pricing of loans is more subjective than the pricing of other financial instruments.
 Cash Surrender Value of Life Insurance
For cash surrender value of life insurance, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Cash surrender value of life insurance is reported in the Level 2 fair value category.
 Other Real Estate
The fair value of other real estate is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. Other real estate is reported in the Level 3 fair value category.
 Deposits
The fair value of demand deposits, interest-bearing demand deposits and savings is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Deposits are reported in the Level 2 fair value category.
 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reported in the Level 2 fair value category.
 FHLB Borrowings
The fair value of FHLB borrowings is estimated based upon discounted future cash flows using a discount rate comparable to the current market rate for such borrowings. FHLB borrowings are reported in the Level 2 fair value category.
 Junior Subordinated Debentures
Because the Company's junior subordinated debentures were issued at a floating rate, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Junior subordinated debentures are reported in the Level 2 fair value category.
 Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit
Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are generally short-term and at variable interest rates. Therefore, both the carrying value and estimated fair value associated with these instruments are immaterial.
 Limitations
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on many judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Fair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include deferred income taxes and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
The fair value presentation for recurring assets is presented in Note 2. There were no recurring liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The fair value presentation for non-recurring assets is presented in Note 3. There were no non-recurring liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
