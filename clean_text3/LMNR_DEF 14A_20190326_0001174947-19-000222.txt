​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
ATTENDING AND VOTING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") has been selected as our inspector of election. As part of its responsibilities, Computershare is required to independently verify that you are a stockholder of the Company eligible to attend the Annual Meeting and to determine whether you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, it is very important that you follow the instructions below to gain entry to the Annual Meeting. 
Check-in Procedure for Attending the Annual Meeting 
Stockholders of Record.   The documents that you will need to provide to be admitted to the Annual Meeting depend on whether you are a stockholder of record or you represent a stockholder of record. 
 Individuals.   If you are a stockholder of record holding shares in your own name, you must bring to the Annual Meeting a form of government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license or passport). Trustees who are individuals and named as stockholders of record are in this category. 
​
 Individuals Representing a Stockholder of Record.   If you attend on behalf of a stockholder of record, whether such stockholder is an individual, corporation, trust or partnership: 
​
 you must bring to the Annual Meeting a form of government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license or passport); AND 
​
 either: 
​
 you must bring to the Annual Meeting a letter from that stockholder of record authorizing you to attend the Annual Meeting on their behalf; OR 
​
 we must have received by 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on March 25, 2019 a duly executed proxy card from the stockholder of record appointing you as proxy. 
​
Beneficial Owners.   If your shares are held by a bank or broker (often referred to as "holding in street name"), you should go to the "Beneficial Owners" check-in area at the Annual Meeting. Because you hold your shares in street name, your name does not appear on the share register of the Company. The documents that you will need to provide to be admitted to the Annual Meeting depend on whether you are a beneficial owner or you represent a beneficial owner. 
 Individuals.   If you are a beneficial owner, you must bring to the Annual Meeting: 
​
 a form of government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver's license or passport); AND 
​
 either: 
​
 a legal proxy that you have obtained from your bank or broker; OR 
​
 your most recent brokerage account statement or a recent letter from your bank or broker showing that you own shares of the Company. 
​
 Individuals Representing a Beneficial Owner.   If you attend on behalf of a beneficial owner, you must bring to the Annual Meeting: 
​
 a letter from the beneficial owner authorizing you to represent such beneficial owner's shares at the Annual Meeting; AND 
​
 the identification and documentation specified above for individual beneficial owners.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Voting in Person at the Annual Meeting 
Stockholders of Record.   Stockholders of record may vote their shares in person at the Annual Meeting by ballot. Each proposal has a separate ballot. You must properly complete, sign, date and return the ballots to the inspector of election at the Annual Meeting to vote in person. To receive ballots, you must bring with you the documents described below: 
 Individuals.   You will receive ballots at the check-in table when you present your identification. If you have already voted by proxy and do not want to change your votes, you do not need to complete the ballots. If you do complete and return the ballots to us, your proxy will be automatically revoked. 
​
 Individuals Voting on Behalf of Another Individual.   If you will vote on behalf of another individual who is a stockholder of record, we must have received by 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on March 25, 2019 a duly executed proxy card from such individual stockholder of record appointing you as his or her proxy. If we have received the proxy card, you will receive ballots at the check-in table when you present your identification. 
​
 Individuals Voting on Behalf of a Legal Entity.   If you represent a stockholder of record that is a legal entity, you may vote that legal entity's shares if it authorizes you to do so. The documents you must provide to receive ballots at the check-in table depend on whether you are representing a corporation, trust, partnership or other legal entity. 
​
 If you represent a corporation: 
​
 you must bring to the Annual Meeting a letter or other document from the corporation, on the corporation's letterhead and signed by an officer of the corporation, that authorizes you to vote the corporation's shares on its behalf; OR 
​
 we must have received by 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on March 25, 2019 a duly executed proxy card from the corporation appointing you as its proxy. 
​
 If you represent a trust, partnership or other legal entity, we must have received by 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on March 25, 2019 a duly executed proxy card from the legal entity appointing you as its proxy. A letter or other document will not be sufficient for you to vote on behalf of a trust, partnership or other legal entity other than a corporation. 
​
Beneficial Owners.   If you hold your shares in street name, these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or their appointed agent. Because your name does not appear on the share register of the Company, you will not be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request a legal proxy from your bank or broker and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting. 
 Individuals.   As an individual, the legal proxy will have your name on it. You must present the legal proxy at check-in to the inspector of election at the Annual Meeting to receive your ballots. 
​
 Individuals Voting on Behalf of a Beneficial Owner.   Because the legal proxy will not have your name on it, to receive your ballots, you must bring to the Annual Meeting a letter from the person or entity named on the legal proxy that authorizes you to vote its shares at the Annual Meeting.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
APPOINTMENT OF PROXY 
Stockholders of Record.   We encourage you to appoint a proxy to vote on your behalf by promptly submitting a proxy by telephone, internet or the enclosed proxy card, which is solicited by the Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Board or our Board. The persons named in the proxy have been designated as proxies by our Board. The designated proxies are officers of the Company. They will vote as directed by the completed proxy. 
There are three ways to vote by proxy: 
 By Mail — Mark, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided or return it to Vote Processing; c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. 
​
 By Telephone — 1-800-652-8683 Use any touch-tone telephone to transmit your voting instructions up until 11:59 P.M., PACIFIC TIME, ON MARCH 25 2019. Have your proxy card in hand when you call and then follow the instructions. 
​
 By the Internet — www.investorvote.com/LMNR Use the internet to transmit your voting instructions and for electronic delivery of information up until 11:59 P.M., PACIFIC TIME, ON MARCH 25, 2019. Have your proxy card in hand when you access the website and then follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form. 
​
If you received a proxy card in the mail but choose to vote by telephone or internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. 
When properly completed, a proxy will ensure that your shares are voted as you direct. To ensure that your vote is represented at the Annual Meeting, we strongly encourage you to complete a proxy regardless of whether you will attend the Annual Meeting. 
You may vote by phone or Internet until 11:59 P.M., PACIFIC TIME, ON MARCH 25, 2019, or Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. must receive your paper proxy card NO LATER THAN 11:59 P.M., PACIFIC TIME, ON MARCH 25, 2019. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR PROXY BY THAT TIME, YOUR PROXY WILL NOT BE VALID. IN THIS CASE, UNLESS YOU ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING, YOUR VOTE WILL NOT BE REPRESENTED. 
Stockholders of record may appoint another person to attend the Annual Meeting and vote on their behalf by crossing out the Board-designated proxies, inserting such other person's name on the proxy card and returning the duly executed proxy card to us. When the person you appoint as proxy arrives at the Annual Meeting, the inspector of election will verify such person's authorization to vote on your behalf by reference to your proxy card. If you would like to appoint a person as proxy other than those designated by our Board, you must do so by using the proxy card, as described above. 
If you wish to change your vote, you may do so by revoking your proxy before the Annual Meeting. Please see "— Revocation of Proxy" below for more information. 
Beneficial Owners.   If you hold your shares in street name, these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker or its appointed agent. You should also have received a voter instruction card instead of a proxy. Your bank or broker will vote your shares as you instruct on the voter instruction card. We strongly encourage you to promptly complete and return your voter instruction card to your bank or broker in accordance with its instructions so that your shares are voted. As described above, you may also request a legal proxy from your bank or broker to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Voting by the Designated Proxies 
The persons who are the designated proxies will vote as you direct in your proxy or voter instruction card. Please note that proxies returned without voting directions, and without specifying a proxy to attend the Annual Meeting and vote on your behalf, will be voted by the proxies designated by our Board in accordance with the recommendations of our Board. Our Board recommends: 
 a vote FOR ALL of the two (2) nominees for director, each to serve for a three-year term ("Proposal 1"); 
​
 a vote FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019 ("Proposal 2"); and 
​
 a vote FOR the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of Named Executive Officers ("Proposal 3"). 
​
Revocation of Proxy 
You may revoke or change your proxy before the Annual Meeting by: 
 sending us a duly executed written notice of revocation prior to the Annual Meeting; 
​
 attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person; OR 
​
 ensuring that we receive from you, prior to 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on March 25, 2019 a new proxy with a later date. 
​
Any written notice of revocation must be sent to the attention of  - Mark Palamountain, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary, Limoneira Company, 1141 Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060 or by facsimile to (805) 525-8211. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
APPROVAL OF PROPOSALS AND SOLICITATION 
Each stockholder who owned shares of stock on February 8, 2019, the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock, ten votes for each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and one vote for each share of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock. On January 31, 2019, we had 17,776,573 shares of common stock, 14,790 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 9,300 shares of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding that were held by approximately 3,000 beneficial holders. 
Quorum 
Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended, which we refer to as the Bylaws, the stockholders present in person or by proxy holding a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders of the Company. Holders of shares of common stock, Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock are the only stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by proxies that are marked "abstain" will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares of stock entitled to vote that are represented by broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when the broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power to vote on that proposal without specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Proposals 1 and 3 described in this proxy statement are non-discretionary items and Proposal 2 described in this proxy statement is a discretionary item. 
If the persons present or represented by proxies at the Annual Meeting do not constitute a majority of the holders of outstanding stock entitled to vote as of the record date, we will postpone the Annual Meeting to a later date. 
Approval of Proposals a)
Election of Directors.   For the election of Class II directors ("Proposal 1"), in accordance with the Bylaws, the affirmative vote of at least a plurality of the votes cast on such proposal is required. For the election of directors, you may elect to cumulate your vote. Cumulative voting will allow you to allocate among the director nominees, as you see fit, the total number of votes equal to the number of director positions to be filled multiplied by the number of votes to which you are entitled. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock and there are two directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting, you may allocate 200 "FOR" votes (2 times 100) among as few or as many of the two nominees to be voted on at the Annual Meeting as you choose. You may not cumulate your votes against a nominee. If you are a stockholder of record and choose to cumulate your votes, you will need to submit a proxy by telephone, internet or mail, or, if you vote in person at the Annual Meeting, submit a ballot and make an explicit statement of your intent to cumulate your votes, either by so indicating on your proxy or by indicating in writing on your ballot when voting at the Annual Meeting. If you hold shares beneficially through a broker, trustee or other nominee and wish to cumulate votes, you should contact your broker, trustee or nominee. If you vote by proxy or voting instruction card and submit your proxy with no further instructions, Harold S. Edwards and Mark Palamountain, as proxy holders, may cumulate and cast your votes in favor of the election of some or all of the applicable nominees in their sole discretion, except that none of your votes will be cast for any nominee as to whom you vote against or abstain from voting. Cumulative voting applies only to the election of directors. For all other matters, each share of common stock and Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for the Annual Meeting is entitled to one vote and each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to ten votes.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
b)
Ratification of Independent Auditor.   For the approval of the proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent auditor for the Company ("Proposal 2"), the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required. An abstention will not be counted toward the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent auditor, and the effect of an abstention is the same as a vote against the ratification. 
​
c)
Approval of Compensation of Named Executive Officers.   For the approval, by advisory vote, of the compensation of Named Executive Officers ("Proposal 3"), the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required. An abstention will not be counted toward the ratification of the compensation of Named Executive Officers, and the effect of an abstention is the same as a vote against the ratification. Broker non-votes will have no impact on this proposal. 
​
d)
Other Matters.   With the exception of certain business combinations, as described in Article Seventeen of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, any other proposal that properly comes before the Annual Meeting must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares present, in person or represented by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. An abstention will not be counted toward the ratification of the proposal, and the effect of an abstention is the same as a vote against the ratification. 
​
All votes will be tabulated by Computershare, the proxy tabulator and inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting. Computershare will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. 
Proposal 2 is a discretionary item, brokers that do not receive instructions from beneficial owners may vote your shares in their discretion. Proposals 1 and 3 are non-discretionary items; brokers may not vote on the proposals without specific voting instructions from beneficial owners, resulting in a broker non-vote. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
We will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies, including, but not limited to, the preparation, printing and mailing of this proxy statement and the proxy card. We have also retained Computershare to distribute copies of these proxy materials to banks, brokers, fiduciaries and custodians, or agents holding shares in their names on behalf of beneficial owners so that they may forward these proxy materials to our beneficial owners. 
We may supplement the original solicitation of proxies by mail with solicitation by telephone, and other means by directors, officers and/or employees of the Company. We will not pay any additional compensation to these individuals for any such services.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Board Composition 
The Bylaws provide that the exact number of directors shall be nine. The Certificate of Incorporation divides the Board into three classes, each class serving for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. The terms of each class of directors is set to expire as follows: Class II to expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Class III to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Class I to expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The terms of office of Gordon E. Kimball and Scott S. Slater, both of whom are Class II directors, expire at the upcoming Annual Meeting and such directors have been nominated for re-election. Lecil E. Cole, who was formerly a Class II director, retired from the Board effective as of December 10, 2018 and will not stand for re-election at the upcoming Annual Meeting. 
You may cumulate your votes for one or more director nominees. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you will need to indicate explicitly your intent to cumulate your votes among the director nominees who will be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. See "APPROVAL OF PROPOSALS AND SOLICITATION — Approval of Proposals — Election of Directors" for more information about how to cumulate your votes. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. 
Our Board has reviewed the materiality of any relationship that each of our directors has with the Company, either directly or indirectly. Based on this review, the Board has determined that the following current directors are "independent directors" as defined by the NASDAQ Stock Market Marketplace Rules, which we refer to as the NASDAQ Rules: Messrs. Edgar A. Terry, Donald R. Rudkin, Robert M. Sawyer, Gordon E. Kimball, John W.H. Merriman, Scott S. Slater and Ms. Elizabeth Blanchard Chess. 
Election of Directors 
The Class II directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting and will serve a term that expires at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Lecil E. Cole retired from the Board effective as of December 10, 2018 and will not stand for re-election as a Class II director at the upcoming Annual Meeting and the Board has nominated Messrs. Gordon E. Kimball and Scott S. Slater for re-election as Class II directors. All of the nominees have indicated a willingness to stand for re-election and to serve if re-elected. It is intended that the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted for the election of the above-named nominees. Although it is anticipated that each nominee will be available to serve as a director, should any nominee be unable to serve, the proxies will be voted by the proxy holders in their discretion for another person properly designated. Each nominee recommended by the Board to stockholders was recommended to the Board by the nominating and corporate governance committee. The following paragraphs describe the business experience and education of Messrs. Gordon E. Kimball and Scott S. Slater.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Code of Ethics 
Our Board has adopted a code of ethics that sets forth our commitment to ethical business practices. Our code of ethics applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and persons performing similar functions. Our code of ethics is available on our website at www.limoneira.com and in print from us without charge upon request by writing to Investor Relations at Limoneira Company, 1141 Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060. We intend to disclose any changes to our code of ethics or waivers thereto that apply to the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and persons performing similar functions by posting such information on our website or by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a Current Report on Form 8-K, in each case, if such disclosure is required by rules of the SEC or the NASDAQ Rules. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role of Risk Oversight 
Generally 
The leadership structure of the Board is centered around the concept of an appropriate balance between management and the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination regarding whether or not to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer based upon the circumstances. The Board believes that presently it is in the best interests of the Company that the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate. The Board believes that this separation is presently appropriate as it allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus primarily on leading the day-to-day operations of the Company while the Chairman can focus on leading the Board in its consideration of strategic issues and monitoring corporate governance, community relations and stockholder issues. To encourage open discussion and communication among the directors, executive sessions of non-management directors are held as necessary. 
Our Board also has three key committees: the audit and finance committee, chaired by Donald R. Rudkin; the compensation committee, chaired by John W. H. Merriman; and the nominating and corporate governance committee, chaired by Robert M. Sawyer. Each of these committees plays an important role in the governance and leadership of our Board and each is chaired by an independent director. For additional information regarding these committees, please see "BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES — Board Meetings and Committees" and for biographies of the chairmen of each of the committees, please see "PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS — Directors Not Up for Re-Election." 
Risk Oversight 
The Board has delegated certain duties with respect to risk oversight for the Company to the audit and finance committee. One of the audit and finance committee's purposes under its charter is to evaluate enterprise risk issues. In furtherance of such purpose, the audit and finance committee charter specifically requires the committee to discuss with management, the internal auditor or internal audit service provider, as the case may be, and the independent auditor the Company's major risk exposures (whether financial, operational or both) and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies. The audit and finance committee reports back to the Board with respect to its assessments. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence 
Policy for Approval of Related Party Transactions 
In accordance with the terms of our audit and finance committee charter, any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations (including Item 404 of Regulation S-K) and PCAOB standards which we refer to as related party transactions, must be identified, reviewed and approved by our audit and  TABLE OF CONTENTS

Details of such related party transactions will be discussed with the Company's independent accountants and publicly disclosed as required by applicable law.

Nominations of Directors and Diversity 
Nominations of Directors 
As provided in its charter, available on our website at www.limoneira.com, the nominating and corporate governance committee will assist the Board by evaluating director nominees for election or re-election. In addition, the committee may review candidates for the Board recommended by executive search firms, the Company's management and other members of the Board who are not members of the committee, as well as candidates recommended by stockholders, in accordance with the following criteria and as discussed in "— Stockholder Nominations of Directors" below. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee, in evaluating director nominees, regardless of whether the Board, management or a stockholder nominated such nominee, may consider some or all of the following factors: 
 the candidate's judgment, skill and experience with other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size, and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight; 
​
 the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other directors; 
​
 the extent to which the candidate would be a valuable addition to the Board and any committees thereof; 
​
 whether or not the person has any relationships that might impair his or her independence, including any business, financial or family relationships with the Company's management; and 
​
 the candidate's ability to contribute to the effective management of the Company, taking into account the needs of the Company and such factors as the individual's experience, perspective, skills and knowledge of the industries in which the Company operates. 
​
In evaluating candidates for election as directors, the nominating and corporate governance committee will also take into consideration the need for the Board to have a majority of directors that are independent under the requirements of the NASDAQ Rules and other applicable laws. 
In addition, the nominating and corporate governance committee will consider in its evaluation of candidates for election as directors the following criteria and qualifications: 
 Leadership Experience.   Such person should possess significant leadership experience, such as experience in business, finance/accounting, law, education or government, and shall possess qualities reflecting a proven record of accomplishment and ability to work with others.

 Reputation and Integrity.   Such person shall be of high repute and integrity. 
​
The Board, as assisted by the nominating and corporate governance committee, seeks and recommends candidates for election or re-election with differences of viewpoint, professional experience, education, skill and other individual qualities. The nominating and corporate governance committee charter provides that the committee endeavor to solicit as director candidates individuals possessing skills and talents that would complement the skills and talents of the Company's existing directors. In addition, before recommending that the Board nominate each new director candidate or re-nominate each incumbent director, the nominating and corporate governance committee assesses each individual's contributions, including the value of his or her experience as a director of the Company and the availability of new director candidates who may offer unique contributions and the Company's changing needs. 
Diversity 
Although the Board does not have a formal policy regarding diversity, the nominating and corporate governance committee's evaluation of director nominees includes consideration of their ability to contribute to the diversity of personal and professional experiences, opinions, perspectives and backgrounds on the Board. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation, disability or any other basis prescribed by law. The nominating and corporate governance committee will assess the effectiveness of this approach as part of its review of the Board's composition as well as in the course of the Board's and nominating and corporate governance committee's self-evaluation. 
Stockholder Nominations of Directors 
To make a director nomination, a stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary at our principal executive office at 1141 Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060. In order for a notice to be timely, it must be delivered to our Secretary at the principal executive office not earlier than the November 15 immediately preceding such annual meeting nor later than the close of business on the 90th day immediately preceding the scheduled date of such annual meeting.

Copies of the charters for each of the audit and finance committee, compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are available on our website at www.limoneira.com, and in print from us without charge upon request by writing to our principal executive offices at Investor Relations at Limoneira Company, 1141 Cummings Road, Santa Paula, California 93060. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference into this proxy statement or incorporated into any other filings that the Company makes with the SEC. 
Audit and Finance Committee.   The audit and finance committee is comprised entirely of independent directors who meet the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, and includes at least one "audit committee financial expert," as required by applicable SEC regulations. The audit and finance committee is also established in accordance with section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The audit and finance committee is responsible for, among other things, retaining and overseeing our independent auditors; assisting the Board in its oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent auditors and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; reviewing and approving the plan and scope of the internal and external audit; pre-approving any audit and non-audit services provided by our independent auditors; and approving fees to be paid to our internal audit service providers. Additionally, the audit and finance committee is responsible for reviewing with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls, preparing the audit and finance committee report to be filed with the SEC and reviewing and assessing annually the audit and finance committee's performance and the adequacy of its charter. Messrs. Rudkin, Sawyer and Terry served on our audit and finance committee in fiscal year 2018 with Mr. Rudkin serving as Chairman. The Board has determined that Mr. Rudkin qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the SEC. The audit and finance committee met four times during fiscal year 2018. 
Compensation Committee.   The compensation committee is comprised entirely of independent directors who meet compensation committee independence requirements of the NASDAQ Rules. In accordance with the compensation committee charter, the members are "outside directors" as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code, and "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. Under the compensation committee charter, the compensation committee is responsible for determining compensation policies for executive officers and independent directors. The compensation committee also oversees the Company's cash and equity-based compensation plans and recommends terms and awards of stock compensation to the Board. Additionally, the compensation committee is responsible for reviewing organizational and staffing matters of the Company, reviewing and discussing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis disclosure with management and recommending its approval in the proxy statement, and granting the right for directors, officers and employees to receive indemnification, as applicable. 
No member of the compensation committee has had any relationship with the Company requiring the disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Messrs. Merriman, Rudkin and Terry served on our compensation committee for fiscal year 2018 with Mr. Merriman serving as Chairman. The compensation committee met one time during fiscal year 2018. 
The compensation committee is responsible for determining all aspects of compensation packages for executive officers, and for reviewing such compensation for our directors. The compensation committee has not delegated any of its authority. From time to time, the compensation committee retains, without the recommendation of management, an independent compensation consultant to provide advice and recommendations on competitive market practices and pay levels of directors, as well as market specific practices regarding incentive based plans. In this role, the compensation consultant works with the compensation committee (and not on behalf of management) to assist the compensation committee in satisfying its responsibilities and will undertake no projects for management except at the request of the compensation committee chair and in the capacity of the compensation committee's agent. For fiscal year 2018 compensation of its Named Executive Officers, the compensation committee utilized Pearl Meyer, a  TABLE OF CONTENTS
leading advisor to boards and senior management on compensation, to assist them in determining the compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers. The analysis provided by Pearl Meyer assisted the compensation committee in establishing appropriate and competitive compensation levels for its Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2018. For additional information concerning the compensation committee's processes and procedures for consideration and determination of executive officer compensation, see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement. With respect to non-employee director compensation for fiscal year 2019, the compensation committee again utilized Pearl Meyer to assist them in determining the compensation of the Company's Board. The changes to non-employee director compensation that resulted from such engagement are discussed under the "Director Compensation" section of this proxy statement. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.   The nominating and corporate governance committee is comprised entirely of independent directors who meet the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Rules. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things, recommending the number of directors to comprise the Board; identifying and evaluating individuals, or incumbent directors, qualified to become or remain members of the Board; recommending to the Board director nominees for each annual meeting of stockholders; recommending to the Board the candidates for filling vacancies that may occur; and reviewing independent director compensation and the Board's processes, self-evaluations and policies. Additionally, the nominating and corporate governance committee oversees compliance with the code of ethics and monitors developments in the law and in corporate governance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS​
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the Summary Compensation Table and related tables that are presented elsewhere in this proxy statement. 
Executive Summary 
Compensation for our executives and key employees is designed to attract and retain people who share our vision and values and who can consistently perform in such a manner that enables the Company to achieve its strategic goals. The compensation committee believes that the total compensation package for each of the Named Executive Officers is competitive with the market, thereby allowing us to retain executive talent capable of leveraging the skills of our employees and our unique assets in order to increase stockholder value. 
In 2010, we adopted the Limoneira Company 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, pursuant to which we may award cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation beginning in fiscal year 2011. On January 24, 2012 and March 27, 2012, the Board, and our stockholders, respectively, approved the amendment and restatement of the 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, to ensure compliance with compensation related to Sections 162(m) and 409A of the Code (the "Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan"). On January 24, 2017 and March 28, 2017, the Board and our stockholders, respectively, approved additional amendments to the Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan to revise limits on stock options and make certain other changes. The Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, is referred to as the Amended and Restated Plan. For fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were both cash-based and equity-based awards granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated Plan. 
The Company's Named Executive Officers refer to those executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table below. Our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2018 were: Harold Edwards, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Palamountain Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary; Joseph Rumley, former Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Corporate Secretary; and Alex Teague, Senior Vice President. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain individuals with the skills required to enable the Company to achieve its strategic goals. The program seeks to remain competitive with the market while also aligning the executive compensation program with stockholder interests through the following types of compensation: (i) base salary; (ii) annual cash-based incentive bonuses; (iii) annual equity-based incentive bonuses; and (iv) discretionary equity-based retention awards and (v) other compensation consisting of retirement and other benefits. 
Key Executive Compensation Objectives 
The compensation policies developed by the compensation committee are based on the philosophy that compensation should reflect both the Company's performance, financially and operationally, and the individual performance of the executive. The compensation committee's objectives when setting compensation for our Named Executive Officers include: 
 Setting compensation levels that are sufficiently competitive such that they will motivate and reward the highest quality individuals to contribute to our goals, objectives and overall financial success. This is done in part through reviewing and comparing the compensation of other companies in our industry. 
​
 Retaining executives and encouraging their continued quality service, thereby encouraging and maintaining continuity of the management team. Our competitive base salaries combined with cash and equity incentive bonuses, and the long-term incentives through our retirement plans and the vesting requirements of our equity-based incentive bonuses, encourage high-performing executives to remain with the Company. 
​
 Incentivizing executives to appropriately manage risks while attempting to improve our financial results, performance and condition. Our cash-based and equity-based incentive plans set Company-specific and individual goals for executives to ensure the executives are compensated in accordance with the Company's performance. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Aligning executive and stockholder interests. The compensation committee believes the use of equity compensation as a key component of executive compensation is a valuable tool for aligning the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our stockholders. 
​
 Obtaining tax deductibility whenever appropriate. The compensation committee believes tax-deductibility for the Company is generally a favorable feature for an executive compensation program, from the perspectives of both the Company and the stockholders. The Amended and Restated Plan has provisions relating to tax withholding and compliance with Section 409A of the Code to ensure executives are obtaining favorable tax treatment. 
​
Key Compensation Decisions and Developments for Fiscal Year 2018 
 Base Pay.   During fiscal year 2018, our Chief Executive Officer received a 5.0% increase in base pay and our Senior Vice President received a 5.3% increase in base pay. Our Chief Financial Officer's base pay was established at $300,000 upon his appointment to the position on January 8, 2018. 
​
 Cash-Based Incentive Compensation.   In fiscal year 2019, cash-based incentive compensation bonuses equal to 24% of base pay were paid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President for fiscal year 2018 performance. 
​
 Equity-Based Incentive Compensation.   For fiscal year 2018 performance, the maximum potential incentive payouts for all Named Executive Officers was 50% of base salary. Based on the Company's performance in fiscal year 2018 and per the terms of the Amended and Restated Plan, equity-based incentive bonuses equal to 30% of base salary were paid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President in fiscal year 2019. 
​
 Equity-Based Retention Award Compensation.   During fiscal year 2018, the compensation committee recommended and the Board approved awards of restricted stock for each of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our Senior Vice President. 
​
General Objectives of the Compensation Program 
The compensation program for our Named Executive Officers is designed to align management's incentives with the interests of our stockholders and to be competitive with comparable employers. Our compensation philosophy recognizes the value of rewarding our Named Executive Officers for their past performance and motivating them to continue to excel in the future. The compensation committee has developed and maintains a compensation program that rewards superior performance of both the Company and of each individual executive, and seeks to encourage actions that drive our business strategy. Our compensation strategy is to provide a competitive opportunity for senior executives taking into account their total compensation packages, which include a combination of base salary, an annual cash-based incentive bonus, an annual equity-based performance incentive bonus, a discretionary, equity-based, retention award and certain perquisites. At the Named Executive Officer level, our incentive compensation arrangements are designed to reward the achievement of year-to-year operating performance goals. 
Oversight of Executive Compensation 
The Role of the Compensation Committee in Setting Compensation.   During fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee had the authority to determine our compensation philosophy and our Board had the primary authority to determine the compensation for our executive officers. Our President and Chief Executive Officer's total compensation was recommended by the compensation committee and approved by our Board. According to the compensation committee charter, the compensation committee will have the authority to determine the compensation of our executive officers in light of individual and corporate achievements. During the first quarter of each fiscal year, the compensation committee establishes performance goals for cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation for each of the Named Executive Officers and, at the end of that fiscal year, determines the level of attainment of those established goals.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Role of Executives in Setting Compensation.   Each Named Executive Officer and other senior executive management team members participate in an annual performance review with our President and Chief Executive Officer or other Named Executive Officers to provide input about his or her contributions to our success for the period being assessed. 
Elements of Compensation 
The material elements of the compensation program for our Named Executive Officers include: (i) base salaries; (ii) annual cash-based incentive bonuses; (iii) annual equity-based performance incentive bonuses; (iv) a discretionary, equity-based retention award and (v) other compensation consisting of retirement and other benefits. 
Base Salaries.   We provide our Named Executive Officers with a base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the fiscal year and sustained performance. The purpose of the base salary is to reflect job responsibilities, value to us and competitiveness of the market. Salaries for our Named Executive Officers are determined by the compensation committee based on the following factors: nature and responsibility of the position and, to the extent available, salary norms for comparable positions; the expertise of the individual executive; the competitiveness of the market for the executive's services; and the recommendations of our President and Chief Executive Officer. The compensation committee believes that the base salary of each of the Named Executive Officers is, particularly in light of each of their total compensation packages, competitive with the market. 
Annual Cash-Based Incentive Bonuses.   Our practice is to award annual cash-based incentive bonuses based upon the achievement of performance objectives established by the compensation committee at the beginning of each year. For fiscal year 2018, the compensation committee established net income and operating income for the year as the performance objectives. The net income performance objective was weighted at 70% and the operating income performance objective was weighted at 30%. 
Each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive an annual cash-based incentive bonus in an amount up to a target percentage of his or her base salary based on the achievement of the established performance objective, subject to the negative discretion of our compensation committee. The target percentage is based on a graduated scale beginning at 10% of a participant's annual base salary and with a maximum of 60% of a participant's annual base salary. 
Any bonuses earned and awarded under the program in respect of a fiscal year are paid in a cash lump sum on or after October 31 of the performance year and on or before January 31 of the year following the performance year. For fiscal year 2018, our Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive a cash-based incentive bonus in an amount equal to 10% of their respective base salaries if the Company achieved net after-tax earnings of at least $4.99 million and operating income of at least $9.19 million. The amount of potential cash-based incentive bonus our Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive increased incrementally up to a maximum of 60% of their respective base salaries if net after-tax earnings were $15.79 million and operating income was $29.07 million. Based on our overall financial performance in fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee awarded a cash bonus to our Named Executive Officers equal to 24% of their base salaries. 
Annual Equity-Based Incentive Bonuses.   It is our objective to have a substantial portion of each Named Executive Officer's compensation contingent upon overall corporate performance and align our Named Executive Officers' interests with those of our stockholders by awarding annual equity-based incentive bonuses. Our compensation committee believes that equity-based annual incentives for the achievement of defined objectives create value for the Company and aligns the executive's compensation with the interests of our stockholders. The compensation committee established overall corporate goals with a view towards establishing such goals that are challenging to achieve, and, at the end of the applicable fiscal year, determines the level of attainment of those established goals and the contribution of each executive towards achieving them. For fiscal year 2018, the compensation committee established net income of  $8.8 million and operating income of  $16.2 million as the performance objectives. The net income performance objective (the "Net Income Goal") was weighted at 70% and the operating income performance objective (the "Operating Income Goal") was weighted at 30%. Each of Messrs. Edwards, Teague and Palamountain were eligible to receive a number of shares of our common stock not to exceed  TABLE OF CONTENTS
an aggregate fair market value equal to 20% of 70% and 20% of 30% of their base salary if at least 75%, but less than 100%, of the Net Income Goal and Operating Income Goal, respectively, are achieved, 35% of 70% and 35% of 30% of their base salary if the Net Income Goal and Operating Income Goal, respectively, are achieved, 40% of 70% and 40% of 30% of their base salary if at least 125% but less than 200% of the Net Income Goal and Operating Profit Goal, respectively, are achieved and up to 50% of 70% and 50% of 30% of their base salary if at least 200% of the Net Income Goal and Operating Profit Goal, respectively, are achieved..In the event that such overall corporate performance goals are obtained, the compensation committee, in its sole discretion, may nevertheless determine not to grant such shares or grant a fewer number of shares depending upon the circumstances such as the achievement of corporate or individual goals or strategic initiatives. Based on our overall financial performance in fiscal year 2018, our compensation committee awarded equity-based incentive compensation to our Named Executive Officers equal to 30% of their base salaries, based on both the net income and operating income performance objectives. The value of stock awards is the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation with the grant date tied to the date the compensation committee makes the determination of the percentage payout. Such awards granted under the Amended and Restated Plan vest one-half on the first anniversary of the issue date and one-half on the second anniversary of the issue date. 
Discretionary Equity-Based Retention Awards.   The compensation committee believes that time-based restricted stock awards serve as a retention incentive for the named Executive Officers. During fiscal year 2018, the compensation committee approved awards of 40,000 shares of restricted stock for its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Harold Edwards; 20,000 shares of restricted stock to its Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Mark Palamountain and 20,000 shares of restricted stock to its Senior Vice President, Mr. Alex Teague. The restricted stock awards vest over five (5) years (20% each year). Such time-based restricted stock awards are awarded from time to time at the discretion of the compensation committee and the Board. In determining the amount of these awards, the compensation committee and Board considers primarily the executive's position and level of responsibility within our Company, as well as the retention and long-term incentive value of the award and the amounts of past awards. 
Retirement Plans.   The compensation committee believes that retirement programs are important to the Company as they contribute to the Company's ability to be competitive with its peers and reward our executive officers based on long-term performance of the Company and, therefore, are an important piece of the overall compensation package for the Named Executive Officers. For all eligible employees, including our Named Executive Officers, we provide a 401(k) plan; others are also participants in our defined benefit pension plan. 
Until June 2004, our employees and executive officers were eligible to participate in a traditional defined benefit pension plan that was maintained by the Company. Effective June 2004, plan participation and benefits payable under that plan were frozen and, since that time, no new participants have been added to that plan. The only Named Executive Officer who is a participant in our defined benefit pension plan is Harold Edwards. At normal retirement age, Mr. Edwards' anticipated monthly payment under this plan would be $81. 
The Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan maintained under section 401(k) of the Code. Under the terms of such plan, eligible employees may elect, beginning after one month of employment, to defer compensation up to that amount of their annual earnings permitted to be deferred under the applicable provisions of the Code. In addition to any deferral contributions made by our employees, the Company contributes to the account of each eligible employee with at least one year of qualifying service a matching contribution of up to 4% of such employee's annual compensation plus such employee's allocable share of any discretionary employer profit-sharing contribution. Participant deferral contributions and employer matching contributions are 100% vested at the time of contribution, and employer discretionary profit-sharing contributions vest at a rate of 20% per year of service beginning after two years of service, becoming 100% vested upon completion of six years of service. During fiscal year 2018, there were no changes made to our defined contribution plan related to Company contributions, contribution limitations, vesting schedules or eligibility requirements. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.   None of our Named Executive Officers participates in or has account balances in nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plans maintained by the Company.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Change in Control, Separation or Severance Benefits.   The Amended and Restated Plan contains provisions that provide for the vesting of options and stock appreciation rights awarded thereunder, as well as the lapse of restrictions on and vesting of all incentive awards issued thereunder upon a change in control or certain termination events. 
Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or by the Board, or a committee thereof, in a written resolution at the date of grant, to the extent outstanding awards granted under the Amended and Restated Plan are not assumed, converted or replaced by the resulting entity in the event of a change in control, all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights become fully exercisable, all restrictions with respect to outstanding awards lapse and become vested and non-forfeitable, and any specified performance goals with respect to outstanding awards shall be deemed to be satisfied at target. 
Except as provided in an Award Agreement or by a Board committee in a written resolution at the date of grant or thereafter, to the extent outstanding awards granted under the Amended and Restated Plan are assumed, converted, or replaced by the resulting entity in the event of a change in control: (i) any outstanding awards that are subject to Performance Share-Based Goals shall be converted by the resulting entity as if target performance had been achieved as of the date of the change in control; (ii) each Performance Share-Based Award or Performance Compensation Award with service requirements shall continue to vest with respect to such requirements during the remaining period set forth in the Award Agreement; and (iii) all other Awards shall continue to vest (and/or the restrictions thereon shall continue to lapse) during the remaining periods set forth in the Award Agreement. 
Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or by a Board committee in a written resolution at the date of grant or thereafter to the extent outstanding awards granted under the Amended and Restated Plan are either assumed, converted or replaced by the resulting entity in the event of a change in control, if a participant's employment or service is terminated without Cause by the Company or an affiliate or a participant terminates his or her employment or service with the Company or an affiliate for Good Reason (if applicable), in either case, during the twelve-(12) month period following a change in control, all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights held by a participant shall become fully exercisable and all restrictions with respect to outstanding Awards shall lapse and become vested and non-forfeitable. Under the Amended and Restated Plan a "change in control" is generally defined to mean: (i) the disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; (ii) any person or group is or becoming the "beneficial owner" directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Company, including by way of merger; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board (together with any new directors whose election by such Board or whose nomination for election by the stockholders of the Company was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Company, then still in office, who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, but excluding any director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board, then in office. 
As each of our Named Executive Officers is not a party to any employment agreement, for purposes of the above, "Cause" means: 
 the intentional engagement in any acts or omissions constituting dishonesty, breach of a fiduciary obligation, wrongdoing, or misfeasance, in each case, in connection with a Named Executive Officer's duties or otherwise during the course of a Named Executive Officer's employment or service with the Company or an Affiliate; 
​
 the commission of a felony or the indictment for any felony, including, but not limited to, any felony involving fraud, embezzlement, moral turpitude, or theft; 
​
 the intentional and wrongful damaging of property, contractual interests, or business relationships of the Company or an Affiliate; 
​
 the intentional and wrongful disclosure of secret processes or confidential information of the Company or an Affiliate in violation of an agreement with, or a policy of, the Company or an Affiliate; 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
 the continued failure to substantially perform the Named Executive Officer's duties for the Company or an Affiliate; 
​
 current alcohol or prescription drug abuse affecting work performance; 
​
 current illegal use of drugs; or 
​
 any intentional conduct contrary to the Company's or an Affiliate's written policies or practices. 
​
Since "Good Reason" is not defined in the applicable Award Agreements of our Named Executive Officers, and such persons are not a party to any employment related agreement, each Named Executive Officer shall not be entitled to terminate his or her employment or service for Good Reason. 
Pursuant to our Award Agreements for restricted stock with our Named Executive Officers, in the event that the employment of a Named Executive Officer with the Company is terminated by the Company on or after the issue date of the Award, other than for Cause, any unvested restricted stock shall become fully vested only in the sole discretion of the Company. The compensation committee (or its designee, to the extent permitted under the Amended and Restated Plan) shall have sole discretion to determine if a Named Executive Officer's rights have terminated pursuant to the Amended and Restated Plan and any Award Agreement, including but not limited to the authority to determine the basis for the Named Executive Officer's termination of employment. In the event that a Named Executive Officer remains in continuous employment with the Company or an Affiliate from the issue date of an Award until a Named Executive Officer's termination due to (i) death, (ii) Disability or (iii) retirement (if the Named Executive Officer has been employed by the Company for a period of at least the five (5) years immediately preceding the grant date and is age 65 or older), any unvested restricted stock previously issued shall become fully vested. For this purpose, "Disability" shall mean a Named Executive Officer is unable to engage in his or her profession by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve (12) months. The compensation committee shall certify Disability, after consultation with a qualified medical examiner, and shall determine a Named Executive Officer's date of termination after taking into account the Named Executive Officer's position and all applicable laws. In the event that Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A") applies and any award would be paid to Named Executive Officer upon a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A, and no exemption or exclusion from Section 409A shall apply, no award shall be released to any Named Executive Officer who is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A until the earlier of the first day of the seventh month after the month of such Named Executive Officer's separation from service or the Named Executive Officer's death. 
The amounts shown in the following table reflect the potential value to the Named Executive Officers, as of the end of fiscal 2018, of full acceleration of all unvested restricted stock awards upon a change in control of the Company and upon certain terminations events. The amounts shown assume that a change in control or termination event was effective as of the last business day of fiscal year 2018 (October 31, 2018) and that the price of the Company's common stock on which the calculations were based was the closing market price on October 31, 2018 ($24.65). The amounts below are estimates of the incremental, lump sum amounts that would be received upon a change in control or certain termination events; the actual amount can be determined only at the time of any actual change in control or termination event.

Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits.   The compensation committee reviews annually the perquisites that Named Executive Officers receive. The primary personal benefits for our Named Executive Officers are health and welfare benefits, including, medical, dental, vision and life insurance, in which the Named Executive Officers participate on the same terms as other company employees. In addition, Company vehicles are provided to the Named Executive Officers, as well as to other members of management. 
Employment Agreements.   As of the end of our 2018 fiscal year, the Company was not party to any employment agreements with any of our Named Executive Officers. 
Other.   The compensation committee also considers the accounting, tax, and stockholder dilutive costs of specific compensation programs, and seeks to balance the earnings, tax and dilutive impact of executive compensation plans with the need to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified executives. 
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
In connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation ("Total Compensation") of the Company's median employee (excluding the Chief Executive Officer), to the Total Compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO Pay Ratio"). 
In identifying the median employee, the Company prepared a list of all employees of the Company, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, along with their annual base wages and salaries ("Annual Earnings") as of October 21, 2018. The median employee, based on Annual Earnings, was selected from this list. The median employee's Total Compensation was then calculated by adding to their Annual Earnings all other compensation for fiscal year 2018, which includes stock awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation, the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings, Company-paid life insurance premiums, profit sharing and Company contributions made under our 401(k) plan and personal usage of Company vehicles.

When making compensation-related decisions, the compensation committee believes it is important to be informed as to the current practices of other companies in our industry and/or similar in size or other attributes to the Company and to set compensation levels for our executive officers that are competitive with such companies. As a result, in determining compensation levels for our Named Executive Officers and for purposes of determining any potential payments to our Named Executive Officers under our annual cash-based and equity-based incentive bonus programs, the compensation committee periodically reviews and compares available salary and incentive bonus information of other companies. As a part of such review and comparison, the compensation committee uses internally prepared surveys and other publicly and privately available information to compare each component of the Company's compensation program to the compensation paid to equivalent executive officers at such companies, with a goal of setting competitive compensation levels for each of our executive officers. The results of the benchmarking activities were utilized in designing our compensation program described in the "Elements of Compensation" section. 
As previously discussed, the compensation committee utilized Pearl Meyer to assist them in determining the fiscal year 2018 compensation for the Company's Named Executive Officers. Pearl Meyer's approach was to conduct interviews with the Company's three Named Executive Officers and the compensation committee, collect data related to the current compensation structure of the Company's Named Executive Officers and develop a peer group of companies to use in conducting a competitive analysis of market compensation. Pearl Meyer provided the compensation committee with a competitive analysis of our current base compensation and annual cash and equity based incentive plans as they relate to our Named Executive Officers. A peer group of 14 companies was developed utilizing a 2017 ISS peer group; companies with revenues between $25 and $750 million and companies included in previous analyses utilized by Equilar, Inc. and Mercer. The 14 peer group companies consisted of; Alico, Inc., Amplify Snack Brands, Inc., Bridgeford Foods Corporation, Coffee Holding Co., Inc., Farmer Bros. Co., Inventure Foods, Inc., Landec Corporation, Lifeway Foods, Inc., MGP Ingredients, Inc., Omega Protein Corporation, S&W Seed Company, Tejon Ranch Co. and The St. Joe Company. The analysis provided by Pearl Meyer will assist the compensation committee in establishing appropriate and competitive compensation levels for its Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2019 as the compensation committee also established a bi-annual review process for the compensation structure of the Company's Named Executive Officers. 
Risk Assessment 
In formulating and evaluating material elements of compensation available to Named Executive Officers, the compensation committee takes into consideration whether any such programs may encourage excessive risk-taking behavior. Based on such review, the compensation committee concluded that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. In making such determination, the compensation committee took into consideration the many design features that mitigate the likelihood of inducing excessive risk-taking behavior. In particular, the compensation committee believes that our use of restricted stock awards, as the primary equity feature in the compensation program, minimizes the risk that the Named Executive Officer's short-term interests may not align with longer-term interests of shareholders. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Effect of Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, pursuant to a non-binding, advisory vote, the stockholders approved the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for such annual meeting. The compensation committee has considered the results of this advisory vote and believes that it shows support by our stockholders for our compensation philosophy and the executive compensation programs that implement our philosophy. We have not significantly changed our executive compensation programs following the advisory vote.

Pension Benefits in Fiscal Year 2018 
The Company's defined benefit pension plan is a tax-qualified retirement plan that covers eligible employees of the Company. Effective in June 2004, participation in such plan was frozen so that anyone who was hired by the Company on or after June 2004 is ineligible to participate in such plan. Under the  TABLE OF CONTENTS
plan, age 65 is considered normal retirement age. Participating employees may retire with benefits as early as age 55, provided they then have at least five years of qualifying service. Normal retirement benefits for a participant are calculated based on such participant's highest average pay over any five consecutive calendar years of employment. The maximum benefit is payable to employees who retire at age 65 with 30 or more years of service and is equal to 65% of such employee's highest average pay less 60% of the applicable participant's estimated annual Social Security benefit. For participating employees who retire at age 65 with less than 30 years of service, their retirement benefit is equal to such maximum benefit amount multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is total years of qualifying service and the denominator of which is 30. For participating employees who elect to retire prior to age 65, the benefits under the Company's defined benefit pension plan that would otherwise be payable to them at age 65 are actuarially reduced to account for the longer period they are expected to be receiving payments. 
Benefits are paid in the form of a life annuity, with married employees having the option to elect to receive benefit payments in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity. Additionally, participating retiring employees may elect a ten-year certain and life optional form of payment, a contingent annuity with a ten-year certain and life optional form of payment or a 100%, 75% or 50% joint and survivor optional form of payment naming someone other than his or her spouse as joint annuitant.

Liabilities shown in this column are computed using the projected unit credit method reflecting average salary and service as of the fiscal year end. The material assumptions used to determine these liabilities can be found in the fiscal year end FAS Disclosures Actuarial Valuation Report, except we assumed no pre-retirement decrements and that retirement occurs at the plan's earliest unreduced retirement age. 
​
(2)
The plan's benefit formula is integrated with Social Security and is based on the participant's years of service for the Company and final average compensation. Compensation is limited to the applicable limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. The plan benefit is limited to the applicable limit under Section 415(b) of the Code. Only employees hired before June 30, 2004 are eligible to participate in the plan. In addition, eligibility for the plan occurs no later than the completion of 500 hours of service in the first twelve months of employment. Effective June 30, 2004, the plan was frozen. Additional benefit service cannot be earned after June 30, 2004. Early retirement age is the first day of any month after age 55, provided the participant has earned five years of vesting service at the time of retirement.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Executive compensation is an important matter to us and to our stockholders. Newly enacted legislation enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78n-1). 
As described in detail under the heading "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our Named Executive Officers, who are critical to our strategic goals and success. Under our executive compensation program, our Named Executive Officers receive compensation that encourages both near-term and long-term growth and successes through compensation linked to performance standards aimed to increase stockholder value. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 
The compensation committee bases its executive compensation decisions on our compensation objectives, which include the following: 
 aligning management's incentives with the interests of our stockholders;
​
 providing competitive compensation to our Named Executive Officers;
​
 rewarding Named Executive Officers for past performance and motivating them to excel in the future; and
​
 rewarding superior performance of both the Company and each individual executive and encouraging actions that promote our near-term and long-term strategic goals. 
​
We believe that our existing compensation programs have been effective at motivating our Named Executive Officers to achieve superior performance and successes for us, aligning compensation with performance measures and stockholder interests and enabling us to attract, retain and motivate talented executive officers. 
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our Named Executive Officers' compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our Named Executive Officers' compensation. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the Annual Meeting pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures by voting FOR the approval of our executive compensation program. 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the compensation committee or our Board. Our Board and our compensation committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will review and consider the outcome of this advisory vote when making future compensation decisions for our Named Executive Officers and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary. 
The Company will include a proposal seeking stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers in its proxy statement every year until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2023. In 2023, the Company will include a proposal seeking stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the frequency at which the Company shall seek stockholder approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.

AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our audit and finance committee is composed of three independent directors, all of whom are financially literate. In addition, the Board has determined that Mr. Rudkin, an independent director and the chairman of the audit and finance committee, qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The audit and finance committee operates under a written charter, which reflects the requirements regarding audit committees under the NASDAQ Rules and The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. A copy of the audit and finance committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.limoneira.com.
The audit and finance committee's primary role is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of  (1) the quality and integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, (2) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent auditors' qualifications, independence and performance and (4) the performance of our internal audit and control functions. 
The Company's management is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements, the financial reporting process and the system of internal controls. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an audit of the financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, and issuing an opinion as to the conformity of those audited financial statements to United States generally accepted accounting principles. The audit and finance committee monitors and oversees these processes. 
The audit and finance committee has adopted a policy designed to ensure proper oversight of our independent auditor. Under the policy, the audit and finance committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing any other audit review (including resolution of disagreements among management and the auditor regarding financial reporting), or attestation services. In addition, the audit and finance committee is responsible for pre-approving any non-audit services provided by the Company's independent auditors. The audit and finance committee's charter also ensures that the independent auditor discusses with the audit and finance committee important issues such as internal controls, critical accounting policies, any instances of fraud and the consistency and appropriateness of our accounting policies and practices. 
The audit and finance committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP the Company's independent auditor, the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31, 2018. The audit and finance committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, as amended (Communication with Audit Committees). In addition, the audit and finance committee has received from the independent auditor its written report required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence from the Company and its management. Based on these reviews and discussions, the audit and finance committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.
