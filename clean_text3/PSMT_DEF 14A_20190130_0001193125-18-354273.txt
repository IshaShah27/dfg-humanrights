PROXY STATEMENT 
for 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
January 30, 2019 
The Board of Directors of PriceSmart, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), is soliciting the enclosed Proxy for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held on January 30, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"), and at any adjournments thereof. This Proxy Statement will be first sent to stockholders on or about December 20, 2018. You can submit your Proxy by mail or you may provide voting instructions for your shares by telephone or via the Internet. Instructions for voting by telephone, by using the Internet or by mail are described on the enclosed Proxy. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and wish to vote your shares personally, you may do so. Unless contrary instructions are indicated on the Proxy, all shares represented by valid Proxies received pursuant to this solicitation (and not revoked before they are voted) will be voted for the election of the Board of Directors' nominees for directors, or for a substitute or substitutes selected by the Board of Directors in the event a nominee or nominees are unable to serve or decline to do so; for the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's executive officers for fiscal year 2018; and for the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019. As to any other business which may properly come before the Annual Meeting and be submitted to a vote of the stockholders, Proxies received by the Board of Directors will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the holders thereof. 
A Proxy may be revoked by written notice to the Secretary of the Company at any time prior to the Annual Meeting by executing a later Proxy or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
The Company will bear the cost of solicitation of Proxies. In addition to the use of mails, Proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile or e-mail, by officers, directors and other employees of the Company. The Company also will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their names, or in the names of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, to send, or cause to be sent, Proxy material to, and obtain Proxies from, such beneficial owners and will reimburse such holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. 
The Company's mailing address is 9740 Scranton Road, San Diego, California 92121. 
Voting 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof. 
As of December 7, 2018, 30,489,396 shares of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ("Common Stock"), were outstanding, representing the only voting securities of the Company. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. 
Votes cast by Proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be counted by the person appointed by the Company to act as Inspector of Election for the Annual Meeting. The Inspector of Election will treat shares represented by Proxies that reflect abstentions or include "broker non-votes" as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Because directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by Proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors, the ten director nominees who receive the greatest number of votes cast will be elected directors. 
The non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019 require the affirmative vote of a majority of the aggregate votes present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are not included as votes cast and will not affect the outcome of any of the proposals. Broker non-votes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a brokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares and the broker does not then vote those shares on the stockholder's behalf. 
CEO Transition 
On October 25, 2018, the Company announced the resignation by mutual agreement of its Chief Executive Officer, President and director Jose Luis Laparte, effective November 16, 2018. The Company appointed Sherry S. Bahrambeygui, a member of our Board of Directors, as Interim Chief Executive Officer effective November 16, 2018 while the Company conducts a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Laparte agreed to support the interim CEO and make himself available at her request through the end of the current calendar year. Robert E. Price, Company Founder and our Chairman, became Executive Chairman in October 2018. 
Proposal 1   Election of Directors 
Based on the recommendation of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company has nominated and recommends for election as directors the ten persons named herein to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors shall have been duly elected and qualified. All of the nominees are presently directors of the Company, and following the Annual Meeting, there will be no vacancies on the Board of Directors. Each of the nominees has consented to serving as a nominee and being named as a nominee in this Proxy Statement and to serving as a director if elected. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by Proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. The enclosed Proxy will be voted in favor of the persons nominated unless otherwise indicated. If any of the nominees should be unable to serve or should decline to do so, the discretionary authority provided in the Proxy will be exercised by the proxy holders to vote the shares represented by the Proxies for one or more substitute nominees selected by the present Board of Directors. The Board of Directors does not believe at this time that any substitute nominee or nominees will be required. 
Nominations Process 
Identification and Evaluation of Nominees for Directors 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees for director by first evaluating the current members of our Board of Directors willing to continue in service. Current members with qualifications and skills that are consistent with the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's criteria for board service, as set forth in the section below entitled "Director Qualifications," and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of our Board of Directors with that of obtaining a new perspective. 
If any member of the Board of Directors does not wish to continue in service or if the Board of Directors decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria set forth below in "Director Qualifications." The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee generally consults with other members of the Board of Directors and may seek input from management, independent counsel, industry experts or advisors that the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee believes to be desirable and appropriate. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews the qualifications, experience and background of any candidates who are identified. Final candidates are interviewed by the members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. In making its determinations, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the Board of Directors as a whole, with the objective of assembling a group that can best perpetuate the success of the Company and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment. After review and deliberation of all feedback and data, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee makes its recommendation to the Board of Directors. 
Pursuant to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee Charter, stockholders of the Company who have held shares of the Company's Common Stock for at least one year and who hold a minimum of 1% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock may suggest a candidate for director by writing to the Secretary of the Company. In order to be considered, the recommendation for a candidate must include the following written information: (1) a detailed resume of the recommended candidate; (2) an explanation of the reasons why the stockholder believes the recommended candidate is qualified for service on the Board of Directors; (3) such other information that would be required by the rules of the SEC to be included in a proxy statement; (4) the written consent of the recommended candidate; (5) a description of any arrangements or undertakings between the stockholder and the recommended candidate regarding the nomination; and (6) proof of the recommending stockholder's stock holdings in the Company. In addition, we may require any candidate to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such candidate to serve as an independent director in accordance with the Company's corporate governance guidelines or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence or lack of independence of such candidate. In order to give the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee sufficient time to evaluate a recommended candidate and/or include the candidate in the Company's 
Proposal 1   Election of Directors (continued) 
 proxy statement for the annual meeting to be held in 2020, the recommendation should be received by the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices no later than August 22, 2019. In the event that the Company receives director candidate recommendations from stockholders, those recommendations are evaluated in the same manner that potential nominees suggested by Board members, management or other parties are evaluated. The Company does not intend to treat stockholder recommendations in any manner different from other recommendations. 
Director Qualifications 
In evaluating director nominees, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers, among other things, the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal and professional integrity, ethics and values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly held company, and a general understanding of marketing, finance  and other elements relevant to the success of a publicly traded company in today's business environment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience in the Company's industry and with relevant social policy concerns;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience as a board member of another publicly held company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• academic or professional expertise in one or more aspects of the Company's current or planned operations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• practical and mature business judgment, including ability to make independent analytical inquiries.  
[END TABLE]
While the Company does not have a specific policy regarding board diversity, in connection with its evaluation of director nominees, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also considers diversity of expertise and experience in substantive matters pertaining to our business relative to other members of the Board of Directors. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also considers diversity of background (including diversity of gender, race and ethnicity) and life experience. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's objective is to assemble a group that can best perpetuate the success of the business and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of experience. 
Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other facts as it may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also believes it is appropriate for at least one, and, preferably, several, members of the Board of Directors to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules, and that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors be independent as required under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards applicable to the Company. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee also believes it is appropriate for the Company's chief executive officer to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Directors' performance and qualifications are reviewed annually by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. 
A copy of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.pricesmart.com. 
Independent Directors 
The Company's Board of Directors has determined that the following nominees for director are "independent" under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards applicable to the Company: Gonzalo Barrutieta, Gordon Hanson, Beatriz Infante, Leon Janks, Mitchell Lynn, Pierre Mignault, Gary Malino and Edgar Zurcher. The Board of Directors also determined that Sherry Bahrambeygui was independent until becoming the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer but that she would not be considered independent for so long as she is serving in that role.

Executive and Director Compensation 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, comprised entirely of independent directors, administers the Company's executive compensation program. The role of the Compensation Committee is to oversee compensation and benefit plans and policies, administer stock plans, and review and approve annually all compensation decisions relating to all executive officers. 
Purposes and Structure of the Executive Compensation Program 
The executive compensation program is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, motivate and retain superior talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourage high performance, collaboration and accountability; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executive pay opportunities with Company performance and stockholder returns.  
[END TABLE]
To achieve these objectives, the Compensation Committee, which is comprised of members who have knowledge of executive compensation levels of other companies by virtue of their professional background, experience and dealings external to the Company, has implemented compensation plans that provide a competitive salary and align compensation with stockholder returns. 
In determining specific amounts and components of compensation, the Compensation Committee considered each officer's performance, level of responsibility, skills and experience, and other compensation awards or arrangements, as more fully described below under "Elements of Compensation." 
Compensation Determination Process 
Each year the Compensation Committee relies on multiple data points to assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation program and the individual compensation of our executives. Information the Compensation Committee uses to perform this analysis includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's performance against its financial and operational goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The mix of short-term and long-term compensation in the form of cash and equity-based compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A review of information on the competitive market, compiled by the Compensation Committee's independent consultant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The expense to the Company of the proposed compensation for the following fiscal year relative to the Company's budget.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all equity awards for all executives and employees. Management provides information to the Committee members at their request to aid in their decision-making. The information includes historical cash compensation and stock grants to the Company's executives, internal equity comparisons, and the financial impact to the Company of particular compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee also receives comparable company compensation information, as described below. 
During fiscal year 2018, the Company's Chairman made recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to salary and restricted stock for the Chief Executive Officer and President, and the Chief Executive Officer and President made recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to salary and restricted stock for the Executive Vice Presidents. In addition, the Compensation Committee regularly engages an independent compensation consultant to conduct market reviews of our competitive market for executive talent. The Committee engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group to conduct a review of market data for use in determining fiscal 2019 compensation levels and to provide recommendations on instituting a 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
long-term performance-based compensation structure, in response to stockholder input. After gathering this input and receiving these recommendations, the Compensation Committee determined the compensation of our Named Executive Officers in executive session. In the case of employees below the level of Executive Vice President, the Chief Executive Officer and President, working with other members of management, set their cash compensation and made recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to equity awards. 
The Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between annual and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of compensation. However, the Compensation Committee believes that long-term compensation plays an important role in encouraging positive results through collaboration, aligning the compensation of the senior management team to stockholder returns and in retaining key executives. In particular, the Compensation Committee believes that the Chief Executive Officer's compensation should be more heavily weighted towards long-term incentives as compared to other members of senior management given his or her greater ability to affect the results of the Company and the importance of retaining his or her services. 
The following table sets forth executive compensation and governance policies and practices we have implemented to advance the objectives of our executive compensation program and to align our practices and policies with industry-leading standards.

Performance Evaluation Process 
The Compensation Committee and our Chief Executive Officer generally consider the following objective and subjective factors when evaluating the performance of our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term strategic goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• short-term business goals;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the performance of our competitors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• specific business challenges and general economic and market conditions.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee and our Chief Executive Officer do not assign any of these performance factors a specific weight, but they seek to strike an appropriate balance each year and for each executive. Further, the Compensation Committee and Chief Executive Officer may consider different factors for each executive. 
Use of Independent Compensation Consultant 
In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group as its independent executive compensation consultant. Semler Brossy has no other business relationship with the Company and receives no payments from us other than the fees for services to the Compensation Committee. Semler Brossy reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee may replace Semler Brossy or hire additional consultants at any time. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
During fiscal year 2018, the scope of Semler Brossy's engagement included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conducting a review of the competitive market information for our executive officers, including our former Chief Executive Officer and President;   
[END TABLE]

Role of Comparable Company Compensation Information in the Compensation Determination Process 
The Compensation Committee establishes individual executive compensation at levels the Compensation Committee believes are comparable with those of executives in other companies of similar size and stage of development operating in retail industries, taking into account our own strategic goals and our relative performance. Management utilized Equilar Inc.'s Executive Insight research database, a resource for referencing executive compensation and analyzing executive pay trends based on information Equilar gathers from proxy statements and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and additional competitive information provided by our compensation consultant, Semler Brossy. 
The most directly comparable companies to PriceSmart are Costco Wholesale Corporation, Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. These corporations' sizes relative to PriceSmart's makes comparisons impractical for executive compensation purposes. In addition, comparable compensation data for Sam's Club is not publicly available, and comparable compensation information has not been available for BJ's until July 2018. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that for fiscal 2018 our Named Executive Officers' compensation should be compared to compensation of executives at public companies Institutional Shareholder Services included in its most recent benchmarking analysis for PriceSmart. ISS uses a peer group comprised of the 16 public companies in the same SIC code as PriceSmart, with revenues between $1.6 billion and $8 billion and employees between 1,500 and 40,000. The Compensation Committee adopted the same group, except that it excluded Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores, Inc. because of its recent bankruptcy filing. The peer group, excluding Sears, consists of the following 15 companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aaron's Inc., Andersons, Inc., Ascena Retail Group, Inc., Big Lots, Inc., Bon-Ton Stores, Inc., Burlington Stores,  Inc., Casey's General Stores, Inc., Dillard's, Inc., DSW Inc., Fred's, Inc., Ingles Markets Inc., Neiman Marcus Group LTD LLC, Rent A Center Inc. DE, Village Super Market Inc., and Weis Markets Inc.  
[END TABLE]
Prior to fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee compared our Named Executive Officers' compensation to that of two groups: U.S.-based retail companies with annual revenues ranging from $1.9 billion to $15 billion and companies based in Southern California with revenues of $196 million to $3.8 billion. The list of U.S. retail companies we previously used is similar to the list of retail companies set forth above, but we believe the list set forth above is comprised of companies more comparable to PriceSmart than our previous list. In addition, given our national recruiting of our two most recently hired Named Executive Officers and that two of our six named executive officers in fiscal 2018 worked outside of Southern California, the Compensation Committee has determined that a peer group comprised of Southern California-based companies is significantly less meaningful than the list of peer companies set forth above. We expect the public companies included in our new peer group to change as companies move into and out of the annual revenue ranges or cease to be publicly traded. In addition, moving forward, the Compensation Committee will review the peer group each year, and it may make changes from time to time to ensure the group remains current and meaningful for benchmarking executive pay levels and practices. 
As part of its compensation program review process, the Compensation Committee assesses the mix of the compensation elements for our Named Executive Officers against compensation data from Equilar, as well as information from Semler Brossy, 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
for similar positions within the peer group. The Compensation Committee noted substantial variation between the compensation levels of similarly situated executives. In particular, the Compensation Committee noted that long-term equity compensation varied significantly company-to-company as a result of differences in the frequency and timing of equity grants. As a result, the Compensation Committee focused on the competitiveness of PriceSmart's cash compensation relative to peer companies. The Compensation Committee determined that the cash compensation for our Named Executive Officers was below competitive midpoints, and therefore, the Compensation Committee concluded that the compensation to PriceSmart executives was not excessive. 
Based on the objectives outlined above, the Compensation Committee strives to set target total compensation opportunity levels and the individual components of compensation to be competitive with the market in which we compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee does not, however, target any specific percentile of market compensation levels. 
Compensation data for the peer group of companies is only one of the many factors the Compensation Committee considers in setting compensation for PriceSmart's Named Executive Officers, and actual compensation may vary based on the Compensation Committee's review of other considerations, including the Company's and the individual Named Executive Officer's performance and the value of the executive's leadership and other skills to the Company. 
Elements of Compensation 
In fiscal year 2018, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers was comprised of base salaries and long-term, equity-based incentives in the form of restricted stock awards and, in the case of two executives, performance stock units. Prior to fiscal year 2016, a portion of our Named Executive Officers' compensation included an annual cash bonus based upon achievement of certain short-term levels of operating income and sales performance. In fiscal year 2016, the Compensation Committee determined that our Named Executive Officers played an important and strategic role in guiding the Company toward sustainable and long-term success that could more effectively be incentivized by eliminating the annual cash bonus and increasing the long-term equity component of Named Executive Officers' compensation. Equity grants to our executives vest with continued service over multiple years. This multi-year approach closely reflects the long-term orientation inherent in our membership-based business model. Further, the Compensation Committee's administration of the annual cash incentive program had been challenging because of economic variability and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in certain of the Company's principal business markets that resulted in financial outcomes unrelated to the performance of management. The Compensation Committee determined that equity grants could help manage through this variability. Finally, equity compensation underscores the alignment of our executives and stockholders over time, enhancing an ethic of ownership within our executive team. 
Base Salary. Base salaries for the Named Executive Officers were initially established either when they were hired into the position from outside the Company or as they were promoted to increasing levels of responsibility within the Company. Base salaries for the Named Executive Officers are generally established based on the scope of their responsibilities, level of experience and individual performance, taking into account both external competitiveness and internal equity considerations. While the goal for the base salary component is to compensate executives at a level that is competitive with the salaries of executives in comparable positions among our peer group, the Compensation Committee does not attempt to set base salaries at a certain target percentile within the peer group. Instead, the Compensation Committee considers external market information only to confirm that its base salary determinations based on the other factors described above are competitive. 
The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the base salary levels of the Named Executive Officers to ensure that there is consistency within the Company based upon scope of responsibility and also to ensure that the base salaries are not excessive relative to the peer companies listed above. In establishing changes to base salaries, the Compensation Committee may consider the overall financial condition of the Company but does not make changes to executive salaries based on the achievement of any particular financial criteria. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
In January 2018, all of the Named Executive Officers received increases to their base salaries of 2%. The increase in base pay for non-executive U.S.-based employees within the Company was 3%. Mr. Laparte received an increase of $15,064, Mr. Heffner received an increase of $8,869, Mr. Naylon received an increase of $10,737, Mr. Velasco received an increase of $8,446 and Mr. Von Chong received an increase of $8,487. In each case, these increases were intended to maintain base salaries at an appropriate level based upon the Compensation Committee's review of peer group companies and taking into account general economic inflation. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation. We believe that long-term incentives for higher level executives are consistent with the values and culture of the Company and therefore should be an integral and heavily weighted part of the overall executive compensation program. Direct linkages of executive pay with the Company's stock price performance encourages and rewards an owner-operator mindset among the Company's executives. 
PriceSmart has used restricted stock as the primary long-term incentive vehicle because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock and the related vesting period help attract and retain executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the value received by the recipient of a restricted stock grant is enhanced as our stock price increases; therefore, restricted stock promotes teamwork and  collaboration and enhances the executives' incentives to increase the stock price and maximize stockholder value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock helps to provide a balance to the overall executive compensation program as restricted stock rewards executives for increases in stockholder  value over the longer term.  
[END TABLE]
PriceSmart historically has awarded restricted stock with time-based vesting to its Named Executive Officers, but the Compensation Committee has determined performance-based equity is an important tool, alongside grants of restricted stock with time-based vesting. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee made the Company's first-ever grants of performance stock units to Mr. Jager, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Velasco, the Company's General Counsel. If the Company achieves revenue or operating income targets specified by the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2019, these awards will vest in two annual installments in October 2019 and October 2020 subject to the recipient's continued employment through those vesting dates. The performance stock units have dividend equivalents, but payment of such amounts will be subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria. 
In fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee decided that the Company should make smaller annual grants of restricted stock vesting over a period of three years instead of the larger, periodic grants vesting over five or more years the Compensation Committee had previously made. In moving to annual awards, the Compensation Committee noted that moving to smaller, but more frequent, awards would give the Compensation Committee greater flexibility to adjust awards to take into account: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an individual's value to the Company, including any extraordinary skills or characteristics which might warrant special consideration;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in external benchmarks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in internal benchmarks, addressing morale and fairness issues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an individual's trend in compensation relative to changes in the financial performance of the Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• fiscal responsibility and appropriateness given the short- and long-term performance of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also noted that annual awards would allow the Company to have better fiscal control of the compensation program; would more easily allow for the implementation of pay-for-performance metrics; and would help prevent hardship or windfall scenarios in future. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
Despite the Compensation Committee's determination in fiscal year 2017 to make grants on an annual rather than periodic basis, it elected not to make any grants to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2017 given grants made in fiscal year 2016 under the prior approach. In addition, apart from supplemental grants of time-vesting restricted stock and performance stock units to Mr. Jager and Mr. Velasco, the Compensation Committee also did not make any grants in fiscal year 2018 as it worked with Semler Brossy to incorporate performance-based vesting into at least a portion of the annual equity incentive awards. The Compensation Committee made grants of performance stock units and restricted stock to our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Laparte) in October 2018 (fiscal year 2019) and made grants of performance stock units and restricted stock to Ms. Bahrambeygui in November 2018 (fiscal year 2019). The grants to Ms. Bahrambeygui are comprised of 2/3 restricted stock and 1/3 performance stock units with the same performance criteria as the other executive officer grants and a one-year vesting schedule. 
The Compensation Committee believes that, moving forward, these two equity instruments—performance stock units and restricted stock—will work together to provide the Company's executives a competitive pay opportunity that focuses executives on maximizing stockholder value over the long term. 
In determining the number of shares of restricted stock to be granted to our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee takes into account the individual's position, scope of responsibility, ability to affect profits and stockholder value, and the value of restricted stock in relation to other elements of the individual executive's total compensation. All awards of restricted stock are made by the Compensation Committee. 
Our Named Executive Officers recognize taxable income from restricted stock when and as shares vest. On each vesting date, the Company repurchases a portion of the shares vesting on such vesting date from the participant to cover the tax obligations triggered by the vesting. The Company repurchases the shares at their fair market value on the date of vesting and pays this amount directly to the taxing authorities. The Company generally receives a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense in the year of vesting, subject to limits on the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to certain executives under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The amount included in the participant's wages upon such vesting, and, subject to Section 162(m), the amount we may deduct, is equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date the shares vest, multiplied by the number of shares vesting. 
Severance and Change in Control Payments. We have entered into agreements and maintain plans that require us to make payments and/or provide benefits to our Named Executive Officers under specified circumstances in the event of a termination of their employment or a change in control. We provide for certain severance benefits in the event that a Named Executive Officer's employment is involuntarily terminated. Such severance benefits are designed to alleviate the financial impact of an involuntary termination through salary continuation and are intended to provide for a stable work environment. We believe that reasonable severance benefits for our Named Executive Officers are important because it may be difficult for our executive officers to find comparable employment within a short period of time following certain qualifying terminations. In addition to normal severance, we provide for accelerated vesting of all equity awards for all employees in the event of a change in control as a means of reinforcing and encouraging the continued attention and dedication of our employees to their duties of employment without personal distraction or conflict of interest in circumstances which could arise from the occurrence of a change in control. We believe that the interests of stockholders will be best served if the interests of our senior management are aligned with them, and providing these change-in-control benefits should eliminate, or at least reduce, the reluctance of senior management to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in the best interests of stockholders. 
The Company provides severance, continuity and change-in-control benefits because they are essential to help us fulfill our objectives of attracting and retaining key managerial talent. These agreements are intended to be competitive with those of similarly sized companies in our industry and company size and to attract and retain highly qualified individuals. While these arrangements form an integral part of the total compensation provided to these individuals and are considered by the 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
Compensation Committee when determining executive officer compensation, the decision to offer these benefits did not influence the Compensation Committee's determinations concerning other direct compensation or benefit levels. 
Other Benefits. PriceSmart's Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, such as our 401(k) plan and our medical, dental, vision, long and short-term disability and life insurance plans, in each case on the same basis as other employees. We also offer our Chief Executive Officer and President a housing allowance and travel benefits in accordance with his employment agreement described below, and we reimbursed moving expenses and are providing a one-year housing allowance of $60,000 for our Chief Financial Offer. The Compensation Committee believes that these perquisites are no greater than competitors' practices. 
Say-on-Pay Feedback from Stockholders 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we sought an advisory vote from our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program and received a 99.7% favorable vote supporting the program, excluding abstentions and broker non-votes. For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the results of the advisory vote as part of its annual review of the compensation provided to our Named Executive Officers and other executives. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the Company's executive officers. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Hedging and Pledging Prohibition 
To further align executive and stockholder interests, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines for our executives and non-employee directors. The guidelines require our Chief Executive Officer to hold Common Stock with a value of at least five times his or her base salary and other executive officers to hold Common Stock with a value of at least one times their respective base salaries. The guideline for non-employee directors is one times their annual cash compensation. Until such time as an executive or non-employee director satisfies the minimum ownership requirement set forth herein, such executive or non-employee directors is required to hold 50% of the equity awards (net of amounts required to satisfy any applicable tax obligations arising in connection with the exercise or vesting of any equity award) granted by the Company on or after the date such executive or non-employee director becomes subject to these guidelines. After an executive or non-employee director satisfies the minimum ownership requirement as of a measurement date, he or she will be deemed to be in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines notwithstanding subsequent changes in the value of his or her stock ownership, so long as the number of shares deemed held does not decrease (as counted in connection with the foregoing valuation methodology). In addition to the minimum stock ownership requirements, we do not allow our executive officers or non-employee directors to enter into any hedging, pledging or monetization transactions involving our Common Stock. 
Recoupment Policy 
We adopted a Compensation Recoupment Policy effective as of September 19, 2017. The recoupment (or "clawback") policy provides the Compensation Committee with broad discretion to recoup certain incentive awards made to the Company's executive officers when it determines that (1) an executive engaged in serious misconduct or failed to supervise a subordinate employee who engaged in serious misconduct which the executive knew, or was reckless in not knowing, was occurring, and (2) such misconduct resulted in a material violation of law or a written Company policy that caused significant financial or reputational harm to the Company. This clawback policy is broader than current and expected regulatory requirements. The policy can be found on the Corporate Governance section of our website.

The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Sherry Bahrambeygui's relating to her service as Interim Chief Executive Officer. The agreement provides for a term beginning on November 16, 2018 and continuing until terminated by either party on 60 days' prior written notice or by the Company immediately for "cause" or upon Ms. Bahrambeygui's death or "disability." The employment agreement specifies a base salary amount of $875,000 per year, which may be increased, but not decreased, at the Company's discretion. The employment agreement states that Ms. Bahrambeygui is entitled to reimbursement of business expenses and is eligible to receive all other benefits offered to senior executives of the Company under the Company's benefit practices and plans. 
Ms. Bahrambeygui's employment agreement contemplates the award of restricted stock and performance stock units having an aggregate target value equal to $2.175 million at the time of grant. Such grants will be made concurrent with the commencement of her employment as Interim Chief Executive Officer. The number of shares covered by such grants will be determined based on an average of the closing price for the 30 trading days prior to the date of grant. Of such grants, two-thirds will be comprised of restricted stock awards with time-based vesting and one-third will be comprised of performance stock units. The restricted stock will vest 12 months from the date of grant, provided that if Ms. Bahrambeygui's employment is terminated by the Company without cause before the completion of the 12-month term, she will receive the greater of 50% vesting or pro rata vesting based on the number of days worked during the 12-month term. Performance stock units will vest based on the Compensation Committee's determination in October 2019 that the Company has achieved revenue or operating income targets specified by the Compensation Committee for fiscal year 2019, provided that if one of the performance criteria is achieved but Ms. Bahrambeygui's employment is terminated without cause before the Compensation Committee makes its determination, she will receive the greater of 50% vesting or pro rata vesting based on the number of days worked. If Ms. Bahrambeygui's employment is terminated due to her death or disability and such death or disability results from events or circumstances occurring while she is traveling for business inside or outside the United States, her restricted stock will vest in full and her performance stock units will vest in full, subject to the achievement of one of the performance criteria. 
In the event that the Company terminates Ms. Bahrambeygui's employment without "cause" or upon her "disability," Ms. Bahrambeygui will be entitled to the following separation benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a success bonus, with at-target performance set at $437,500. The final amount of such Success Bonus will be subject to  the discretion of the Compensation Committee, taking into account a number of factors, including the length of Ms. Bahrambeygui's tenure as Interim Chief Executive Officer and her success in achieving objectives relating to strategic plan  and process, operating process, organizational process, compensation practices and management development; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued contribution of the premium cost for Ms. Bahrambeygui's and her eligible dependents' participation in the Company's group health  plan for six months.  
[END TABLE]
The foregoing separation benefits are the exclusive benefits that would be payable to Ms. Bahrambeygui under her employment agreement by reason of her termination. Payment of the separation benefits is conditioned on Ms. Bahrambeygui's continued compliance with her obligations with respect to confidentiality, non-solicitation of employees and non-interference with the Company's customers and contracts and Ms. Bahrambeygui (or her estate) executing and delivering to the Company a full release of all claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
If Ms. Bahrambeygui remains in the Interim Chief Executive Officer role into the eleventh month of service, the Compensation Committee will determine her compensation to take effect after completion of the first twelve months of the term of her Employment Agreement based on circumstances at that time. 
The Company also has entered into employment agreements with each of its other executive officers that automatically renew each year unless either the Company or the executive provides at least 60 days' notice that the Company or executive, as the case may be, wishes to terminate the agreement. Each employment agreement specifies the base salary in effect at the time the agreement was entered into and provides that the amount may be increased, but not decreased, at the Company's discretion. 
The employment agreements state that the executive is eligible to participate in the Company's bonus plan in effect at the time and to receive all other benefits offered to senior executives of the Company under the Company's benefit practices and plans. The Company discontinued its annual bonus plan in fiscal 2016, so there was no payment required to be made thereunder during fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2018. 
In addition to termination at the end of the term if one party elects to terminate the agreement, the executive may terminate his or her employment on 60 days' prior written notice. The Company may terminate the executive's employment with cause upon immediate notice or without cause upon 30 days' prior written notice. In the event that (i) the Company terminates an executive's employment without "cause"; (ii) upon termination due to an executive's "disability"; (iii) the executive terminates his or her employment for "good reason"; or (iv) the Company elects to cause the non-renewal of the employment agreement such that it expires at the end of its then-current term, subject to the executive providing a release to the Company, the executive will be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of an amount equal to one times base salary then in effect, payable in 24 equal installments over a period of 12 months,   
• continued contribution of the premium cost for the executive's and his eligible dependents' participation in the Company's group health plan for  12 months,  
• payment of any accrued but any unpaid bonus for year prior to termination and a pro rata bonus earned for the year of termination (payable when all other bonuses  are paid).  
[END TABLE]
Upon an executive's death, the executive's estate will be entitled to receive continued contribution of the premium cost for executive's eligible dependents' participation in the Company's group health plan for 12 months and payment of any accrued but any unpaid bonus for year prior to termination and a pro rata bonus for the year of termination (payable when all other bonuses are paid). 
The employment agreements also contain confidentiality provisions, restrictions on solicitation of employees and interference with the Company's customers and contracts, and other terms and conditions customary to executive employment agreements.

2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan 
The 2013 Equity Incentive Award Plan of PriceSmart, Inc.

The 2013 Plan provides for awards covering up to (1) 600,000 shares of Common Stock plus (2) the number of shares that remained available for issuance under the 1998 Equity Participation Plan of PriceSmart, Inc., the 2001 Plan and the 2002 Plan (collectively, the "Prior Plans") as of January 22, 2013. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan increases during the term of the 2013 Plan by the number of shares relating to awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan or any of the Prior Plans that expire, or are forfeited, terminated, cancelled or repurchased, or are settled in cash in lieu of shares; however, in no event will more than an aggregate of 951,741 shares of our Common Stock be issued under the 2013 Plan. As of November 30, 2018, the 2013 Plan provided for the issuance of up to 858,611 shares (including shares originally authorized for issuance under the Prior Plans), with 357,737 shares subject to outstanding and unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units and 500,874 shares remaining available for future grants. 
The 2013 Plan provides that in the event of a "Change in Control" or a "Corporate Transaction," each as defined in the 2013 Plan, each outstanding award shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control or Corporate Transaction, automatically become fully vested, exercisable or payable, as applicable, for all of the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to such award and, as applicable, may be exercised for any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock, subject to prior achievement of vesting criteria in the case of performance stock units. 
The Retirement Plan of PriceSmart, Inc. 
In 1998, the Company established a retirement plan. The retirement plan is designed to be a "qualified" plan under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, covering all employees, as defined in the retirement plan. Each year, participants may contribute up to 100% per pay period of their pre-tax annual compensation (as defined in the retirement plan) up to the maximum allowable by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Participants also may contribute amounts representing distributions from other qualified plans. Effective January 1, 2011, the Plan was amended to replace the Company match with a discretionary contribution of 4% of the employee's eligible compensation up to the IRS maximum 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
allowed to all employees regardless of their own salary deferrals. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company began providing up to a 2% matching contribution to non-officer employees who contribute at least 1% of their eligible pay. Although the Company has not expressed any intent to do so, the Company has the right under the retirement plan to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the retirement plan, subject to the provisions of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. All participants in the retirement plan are immediately vested in their accounts and earnings thereon.

Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
Severance and Change in Control Payments 
The following table summarizes the potential payments to each Named Executive Officer in two different potential scenarios: (1) a termination of the Named Executive Officer without cause and (2) a change in control without a termination of employment. The table assumes that the termination of employment or change in control occurred on August 31, 2018, the last business day of our last completed fiscal year. For purposes of estimating the value of accelerated vesting of equity awards to be received in the event of a change in control, the Company has assumed a price per share of our Common Stock of $86.85, which represents the closing market price of our Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on August 31, 2018 (the last trading day of fiscal year 2018). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)   Under the Named Executive Officer's employment agreement, in the event of his termination other than for cause, death or disability, he will be entitled  to payment of an amount equal to one times base salary then in effect, payable in 24 equal installments over a period of 12 months.    
  (2)  Under the terms of our equity incentive award plans, vesting of all restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance stock units for which at  least one of the performance criteria have been met will accelerate upon a change in control.

  (4)  Includes 1,746 performance stock units, valued for purposes of this table at $151,640, the vesting of which will accelerate upon a change in control only if  one of the performance criteria has been met prior to the change in control.    
  (5)  In addition to salary continuation for one year, Mr. Von Chong would be entitled to receive in the event of his termination other than for cause, death  or disability, a "Fondo de Cesentía" severance award in the amount of $150,537 pursuant to Panama law.    
[END TABLE]
Director Compensation 
Each non-employee director receives an annual retainer for serving on the Board of Directors. 
Effective February 3, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the following cash compensation program for the non-employee directors. Under the program, each non-employee director receives an annual retainer of $36,000 per year for serving on the Board of Directors. Additionally, non-employee directors who serve on, but do not chair, committees receive an additional $5,000 per year per committee. Committee chairpersons receive additional annual retainers as follows: the chairperson of the Compensation Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000, the chairperson of the Finance Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $19,000, the chairperson of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $10,000, and the chairperson of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $45,000. These annual retainers are paid on a quarterly basis. Ms. Infante receives an additional retainer of $25,000 in recognition of her devotion of significant additional time to supporting the Board of Directors and management on technology matters. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
In addition, effective April 20, 2017, the Board of Directors adopted a policy of annual restricted stock unit awards tied to the year of service and rescinded a standing resolution pursuant to which a person who was initially elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, and who was a non-employee director at the time of such initial election or appointment, would be automatically granted such number of restricted stock units, with dividend equivalents thereon, equal to (1) $100,000 divided by (2) the 30-trading-day average of the Company's stock price prior to the date of such election or appointment. 
Effective January 24, 2018, the Board of Directors granted to each non-employee director an award of restricted stock units under the 2013 Plan, with dividend equivalents thereon, covering a number of shares having a value equal to $80,000 minus the value of RSUs vesting during the one-year vesting period of the new grants (based on the value at the time such awards were granted). To determine the number of shares covered by the new grants, the Board of Directors divided the dollar value of the award to be granted by the 30-trading-day average of the Company's stock price prior to the grants. These awards will vest in full on January 31, 2019 or the date of the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders, whichever is sooner, subject to the non-employee director's continued service on the Board of Directors on such vesting date. The vesting of all restricted stock units accelerates automatically upon a change in control. 
Directors also receive reimbursement for travel expenses incurred in connection with their duties as directors. 
The following table sets forth a summary of the compensation we paid or was earned by our non-employee directors in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)    Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit award granted to the director on January 24, 2018 calculated in accordance  with ASC 718.

  (4)   Effective May 1, 2012, Mr. Price declined further compensation for his services as a director.    
[END TABLE]
Risk Assessment 
Management assessed the Company's compensation program for the purpose of reviewing and considering any risks presented by the Company's compensation policies and practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
As part of that assessment, management reviewed the primary elements of our compensation program, including base salary and long-term equity compensation. Management's risk assessment included a review of the overall design of each primary element of our compensation program and an analysis of the various design features, controls and approval rights in place with respect to compensation paid to management and other employees that mitigate potential risks to the Company. 
Management also noted that we have adopted stock ownership guidelines for our executives and non-employee directors. Management believes the adoption of such guidelines further aligns the interests of our Chief Executive Officer and President, our other executive officers and our Board of Directors with those of our stockholders. Management also noted that the adoption of the Company's Compensation Recoupment Policy provides the Compensation Committee with broad discretion to recoup certain incentive awards made to the Company's executive officers in instances of material violations of law or a written Company policy by an executive officer or by a subordinate employee if the executive failed to supervise the subordinate, if the misconduct caused significant financial or reputational harm to the Company. 
Following the assessment, management determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices did not create risks that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and reported the results of the assessment to the Compensation Committee. 
Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of all our employees and the annual total compensation of José Luis Laparte, our former Chief Executive Officer and President. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For fiscal year 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other than our Chief Executive Officer and President) was $10,357; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table set forth above, was $880,268.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for fiscal year 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 85.0 to 1. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees and determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President, we took the following steps: 
1.    We identified the median employee using our employee population on August 31, 2018, the last day of fiscal year 2018. This population consisted of full-time employees and part-time employees. 
2.    To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we first determined the amount of each employee's gross earnings (i.e., sum of base pay, cash bonus and equity compensation) as reflected in our payroll records for fiscal year 2018. 
3.    We then identified our median employee from our employee population using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. 
Executive and Director Compensation (continued) 
4.    Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for fiscal year 2018, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $10,357. Our median employee is a full-time merchandise stocker in one of our Trinidad warehouse clubs. 
5.    With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our Summary Compensation Table for fiscal year 2018.

The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that our executive compensation program fulfills these goals and is reasonable, competitive and aligned with our performance and the performance of our executives. 
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask that our stockholders vote "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure." 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the approval of the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be so voted unless stockholders specify otherwise on the accompanying Proxy. 
Proposal 3   Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Subject to ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting, the Board, upon recommendation of the Audit Committee, has selected Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019. EY has issued its reports, included in the Company's Form 10-K, on the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. EY has served the Company as independent auditors since the Company's spin-off from Price Enterprises, Inc. in 1997. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, we are submitting the appointment of EY to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If you fail to ratify the appointment, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain EY. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee in their discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has selected EY to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, subject to the Company and EY agreeing on a mutually acceptable engagement letter. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. Such representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit and non-audit fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by EY, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for the indicated services for each of the last two fiscal years were as follows (in thousands): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(1)   $ 2,400     $ 2,601   
 Audit-Related Fees(2)     15       0   
 Tax Fees(3)     38       30   
 All Other Fees(4)     8       5   
 Total   $ 2,461     $ 2,637   
  (1)   Audit Fees consist of fees for professional services performed by EY for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and review of quarterly  financial statements.    
  (2)  Audit-Related Fees consist of fees for assurance and related services performed by EY that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of  the Company's financial statements.    
  (3)  Tax Fees consist of fees for professional services performed by EY with respect to tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.    
  (4)  For fiscal years 2017 and 2016, All Other Fees consist of license fees for a software tool provided by EY.    
[END TABLE]
Audit Committee Policy Regarding Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Our Audit Committee has established a policy that generally requires that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. From the time that the pre-approval requirements became effective, all permissible non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm 
Proposal 3   Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (continued) 
have been pre-approved by the Company's Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of services under the heading "All Other Fees" is compatible with maintaining the accountants' independence and determined that it is consistent with such independence. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the selection of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be so voted unless stockholders specify otherwise on the accompanying Proxy. 
General 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, directors, officers and beneficial owners of 10% or more of the Company's Common Stock, or reporting persons, are required to report to the SEC on a timely basis the initiation of their status as a reporting person and any changes with respect to their beneficial ownership of the Common Stock. Based solely on our review of such forms received by the Company and the written representations of the reporting persons, the Company has determined that no reporting persons known to the Company were delinquent with respect to their reporting obligations as set forth in Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. 
Stockholder Proposals 
In order to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020, proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at that meeting must be received by us no later than August 22, 2018, which is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing date of this Proxy Statement. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the Securities and Exchange Commission for such proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement. Under our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, a stockholder who wishes to make a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting without including the proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting must notify us no earlier than October 2, 2019 and no later than November 1, 2019 unless the date of the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the 2019 annual meeting. If the stockholder fails to give notice by this date, then the persons named as proxies in the proxies solicited by the board of directors for the 2019 Annual Meeting may exercise discretionary voting power regarding any such proposal. 
Annual Report 
The Annual Report of the Company for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 will be mailed to stockholders of record on or about December 20, 2018. The Annual Report does not constitute, and should not be considered, a part of this Proxy solicitation material. 
If any person who was a beneficial owner of Common Stock of the Company on the record date for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders desires additional information, a copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K will be furnished without charge upon receipt of a written request identifying the person so requesting a report as a stockholder of the Company at such date. Requests should be directed to PriceSmart, Inc., 9740 Scranton Road, San Diego, California 92121, Attention: Secretary. 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
If you share an address with another stockholder, you may receive only one set of proxy materials unless you have provided contrary instructions. The rules promulgated by the SEC permit companies, brokers, banks or other intermediaries to deliver a single copy of a proxy statement and annual report to households at which two or more stockholders reside. This practice, known as "house holding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings, save significant printing and postage costs, and conserve natural resources. Stockholders will receive only one copy of our proxy statement and annual report if they share an address with another stockholder, have been previously notified of house holding by their broker, bank or other intermediary, and have consented to house holding, either affirmatively or implicitly by not objecting to house holding. If you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings, and receive separate annual reports and proxy statements for each stockholder sharing the same address, please contact your broker, bank or other intermediary. You may also obtain a separate annual report or proxy statement without charge by sending a written request to PriceSmart, Inc., 9740 Scranton Road, San Diego, California 92121, Attention: Secretary or call Investor Relations at (858) 404-8800. We will promptly send additional copies of the annual report or proxy statement upon receipt of such request. Stockholders sharing an address that are receiving multiple copies of the annual 
General (continued) 
report or proxy statement can request delivery of a single copy of the annual report or proxy statement by contacting their broker, bank or other intermediary, sending a written request to the Company at the address above or calling Investor Relations at the telephone number above. 
Other Matters 
The Board of Directors does not know of any matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting which is not listed on the Notice of Annual Meeting and discussed above. If other matters should properly come before the meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying Proxy will vote all Proxies in accordance with their best judgment. 
ALL STOCKHOLDERS ARE URGED TO COMPLETE, SIGN AND RETURN 
THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY CARD IN THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE.
