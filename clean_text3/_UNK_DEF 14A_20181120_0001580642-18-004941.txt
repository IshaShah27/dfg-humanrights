Dear Shareholder,    
We are excited to announce great news regarding Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund (the "Fund").
Since launching the Fund in 2012, LCM Investment Management, LLC ("LCM" or "we") have taken great strides toward achieving our goals for the Fund: to manage a portfolio primarily consisting of alternative investments delivering long-term, risk-adjusted returns non-correlated to traditional stock and bond investments. Along the way, we both improved our investment process and expanded our team. 
We are now taking the next step in the evolution of the Fund, and further expanding our team and capabilities by joining forces with Destra Capital Advisors LLC and its affiliates ("Destra"). Destra specializes in raising capital and operating funds like the Fund. As of June 30, 2018, Destra has raised more than $5 billion across the nine funds the firm advises, distributes or services. Destra brings strategic collaboration, resources and new relationships that we believe will greatly benefit the Fund and, ultimately, you (the shareholder).  To effect the new relationship with Destra as anticipated, we need your vote as described in the attached proxy materials. In particular, the Fund's Board of Trustees recommends that you vote FOR the proposals allowing:
In addition, to provide more flexibility in selecting investments for the Fund's investment portfolio, the Fund's Board of Trustees further recommends that you vote FOR a proposal allowing the Fund to change its status to a "non-diversified" investment company. As further described in the attached materials, such a change will allow the Fund to take greater positions in individual investments than what is currently permitted.
The Fund's current advisory fee rate will not change as a result of the proposed change in adviser. However, we hope to achieve increased efficiency across several areas of Fund operations, which may result in cost savings to our shareholders over time. While LCM will continue to manage the Fund's investment strategy and portfolio, as it has since inception, we look forward to drawing upon the industry relationships and decades of experience from both Destra and the new Board of Trustees as we continue to manage a unique, one of a kind portfolio providing access to institutional-quality alternative investments. As such, if Proposals 1, 2 and 3 are approved by shareholders, the name of the Fund will change to Destra Alternative Access Fund.
Thank you, and please return your YES proxy vote to all four proposals promptly.
Regards,
Raymond J. Lucia, Jr.
PROPOSAL 1
APPROVAL OF A NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
DESTRA AND THE TRUST 
Background
Destra is a privately-held investment advisory firm, based in Chicago, Illinois, that is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Destra is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Destra Capital Management LLC, a sponsor of investment funds. Destra provides investment advice to open-end and closed-end investment companies. As of September 30, 2018, the Adviser had approximately $299 million in assets under management.
The Fund's current investment adviser, LCM, has served in such capacity since inception of the Fund, pursuant to a prior advisory agreement with the Trust and the current advisory agreement with the Trust (the "Current Advisory Agreement"). In September 2018, LCM notified the Trust that while LCM desired to continue to manage the Fund's portfolio, LCM believed that it would be in the best interests of shareholders of the Fund if (i) Destra replaced LCM as the Fund's principal investment adviser and (ii) LCM served the Fund as its sub-adviser.
Destra operates an affiliated broker dealer with a team of external wholesalers and national account personnel who have deep experience in selling investments like the Fund, uses highly sophisticated data and client relationship management systems to effectively market Destra's offerings, thoroughly trains its sales personnel, and has a broad network of relationships with financial intermediaries. Based on these factors, the Trustees, LCM and Destra believe the proposed change to the Fund's management structure has the potential to (i) expand the Fund's presence in more distribution channels; (ii) increase its asset base; and (iii) lower operating expenses as a percentage of assets due to the potential increase in Fund size.
On August 28, 2018, Destra and LCM entered into a separate agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Destra will acquire certain assets related to LCM's business of providing investment management services to the Fund (the "Business") if Destra becomes the investment adviser of the Fund pursuant to the Proposed Advisory Agreement (as defined below) and upon receipt of the necessary approvals of the Proposed Advisory Agreement and satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions. More specifically, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, LCM has agreed to transfer to Destra, for a cash payment at the closing of the Asset Transfer (as defined below), an earnout payment (additional future payment based, in part, on the future size of the Fund), and subject to certain exceptions: (i) all right, title and interest of LCM in and to all books and records to the extent used in or relating to the Business; (ii) all goodwill of LCM relating solely to the Business. Such transfers hereinafter are referred to collectively as the "Asset Transfer." Raymond J. Lucia, Jr., a Trustee who is currently an "interested person" of the Fund as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "Interested Trustee") and the Fund's President, will benefit from the Asset Transfer as a direct majority owner of LCM. None of the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Fund (the "Independent Trustees") as that term is defined in the 1940 Act), the Nominees (as defined below), or their associates have any interest in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
The Fund is not a party to the Asset Purchase Agreement; however, the completion of the Asset Transfer is subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval of Proposals 1, 2 and 3 (the "Transaction") described in this Proxy Statement. Therefore, if shareholders do not approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement (as defined below) and elect the Trustee nominees at the Meeting or if the other conditions in the Asset Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived, then the Asset Transfer will not be completed, the Asset Purchase Agreement will terminate, LCM will continue as the Fund's adviser, and the Fund's current Trustees will continue to serve on the Fund's Board of Trustees.
As a result, LCM informed the Trust that LCM would recommend that the Board approve, subject to shareholder approval, (i) the engagement of Destra as adviser to the Fund pursuant to a new investment advisory agreement (the "Proposed Advisory Agreement") and (ii) the engagement of LCM as the Fund's sub-adviser, pursuant to a new sub-advisory agreement (the "Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement"). The 1940 Act, requires that advisory and sub-advisory agreements be approved by a "vote of a majority of the outstanding securities" of the
Fund, as that phrase is defined in the 1940 Act. LCM therefore informed the Trust that if shareholder approval were obtained for the Proposed Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements, LCM would recommend termination of the Current Advisory Agreement concurrent with the effective dates of the Proposed Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements and the engagement of LCM as the Fund's sub-adviser.
At a meeting on October 2, 2018 (the "Board Meeting"), the Trustees approved the Proposed Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements. At the Board Meeting, the Trustees also approved the termination of the Current Advisory Agreement, such termination to be concurrent with the effective dates of the Proposed Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements. The effective date of the Proposed Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements would be on/or about December 1, 2018.
As stated above, the 1940 Act requires that investment advisory agreements such as the Proposed Advisory Agreement and Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement be approved by shareholders. Therefore, shareholders are being asked to approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement and Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.
The proposed change to the Fund's management structure will shift management oversight responsibility for the Fund from LCM to Destra. The day-to-day portfolio management responsibility of the Fund will remain the same, as the Fund's current adviser, LCM, will become the Fund's sub-adviser, under the supervision of Destra. By engaging Destra as the adviser to the Fund and LCM as the sub-adviser to the Fund, the Fund will be sub-advised by the same portfolio managers who currently advise the Fund.
As noted above, Destra and LCM believe that the proposed change to the Fund's management structure has the potential to (i) expand the Fund's presence in more distribution channels via Destra's industry presence; (ii) increase the Fund's asset base; and (iii) lower operating expenses as a percentage of assets due to the potential increase in Fund size. Furthermore, Destra offers a strong commitment to and record of regulatory and legal compliance in its registered funds.

The Current Advisory Agreement was submitted to a vote of the Fund's shareholders on August 4, 2017 due to a proposed change in fee structure, became effective on August 4, 2017, and was most recently renewed by the Board on October 2, 2018.
As stated above, under the terms of the Current Advisory Agreement and the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the adviser is entitled to receive an annual fee from the Fund equal to 1.35% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, LCM earned $2,222,113 in management fees under the Current Advisory Agreement, of which $386,639 was waived pursuant to an expense limitation agreement.
The Proposed Advisory Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You should read the Proposed Advisory Agreement. The description in this Proxy Statement of the Proposed Advisory Agreement is only a summary.
If the Proposed Advisory Agreement is approved, Destra and the Fund will enter into an expense limitation agreement (the "Proposed Expense Limitation Agreement") under which, for a term of two years from the effective date of the Proposed Advisory Agreement, Destra would reduce its fees and/or absorb expenses of the Fund to ensure that total fund operating expenses after fee waiver and/or reimbursement (excluding any front-end or contingent deferred loads, brokerage fees and commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including, for example, options and swap fees and expenses), borrowing costs (such as interest and dividend expense on securities sold short), taxes and extraordinary expenses, such as litigation expenses (which may include indemnification of Fund officers and Trustees and contractual indemnification of Fund service providers (other than Destra)) will not exceed 1.95% of Class A shares' net assets, 2.45% of Class L shares' net assets, 2.70% of Class C shares' net assets, and 1.70% of Class I shares' net assets. The terms of the Proposed Expense Limitation Agreement are identical to the terms of the Fund's current expense limitation agreement with LCM, except that the duration and parties are changed.
The effective date of the Proposed Advisory Agreement would be on/or about December 1, 2018.
Change in Fund Name
If the Proposed Advisory Agreement is approved, the name of the Fund will change to Destra Alternative Access Fund.

For the services Destra provides to the Credit Fund, Destra receives a management fee calculated at 1.75% of the Credit Fund's average daily "Managed Assets." "Managed Assets" equals the total assets of the Credit Fund (including any assets attributable to money borrowed for investment purposes) minus the sum of the Credit Fund's accrued liabilities (other than money borrowed for investment purposes).

"Ordinary operating expenses" consist of all ordinary expenses of the Credit Fund, including investment management fees, administration fees, transfer agent fees, organization and offering expenses, fees paid to the Credit Fund's trustees, administrative services expenses, and related costs associated with legal, regulatory compliance and investor relations, but excluding the following: (a) portfolio transaction and other investment-related costs (including brokerage commissions, dealer and underwriter spreads, commitment fees on leverage facilities), prime broker fees and expenses, and dividend expenses related to short sales), (b) interest expense and other financing costs, (c) taxes, (d) shareholder service fees, if any, and (e) extraordinary expenses.
As of June 30, 2018, the Credit Fund's net assets totaled approximately $24,744,370. The Credit Fund commenced operations on May 9, 2018.
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees (Advisory Agreement)
At a meeting held on October 2, 2018, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, considered the approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement. In considering the approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Trustees received materials specifically relating to the Proposed Advisory Agreement.
The Trustees considered the following material factors during their deliberations: (1) the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided by the Adviser; (2) the investment performance of the Fund and the Adviser; (3) the cost of services to be provided and the profits to be realized by the Adviser and its affiliates; (4) the extent to which economies of scale will be realized as the Fund grows; and (5) whether the fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of investors. The Trustees relied upon the advice of counsel and their own business judgment in determining the before-mentioned material factors to be considered in evaluating the Proposed Advisory Agreement and the weight to be given to each factor considered. The conclusions reached by the Trustees were based on a comprehensive evaluation of all of the information provided and were not the result of any one factor. Moreover, each Trustee may have afforded different weight to the various factors in reaching his or her conclusions with respect to the approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement.
Nature, Extent and Quality of Service. In evaluating whether to approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided under the agreement. They noted that the Adviser currently served as the investment adviser to three registered investment companies, including an interval fund like the Fund, and they observed that the Adviser's personnel have significant experience in investment company management. The Board evaluated the compliance program developed by the Adviser, including the background and experience of compliance personnel. The Board noted the Adviser's intention to make no changes to the Fund's investment objectives or strategy. In light of the Fund's investment strategy, the Board also reviewed the Adviser's fair valuation policies and procedures. In addition to the proposed advisory services, the Board also considered that the Adviser intended to engage LCM, the Fund's current adviser, as the Fund's sub-adviser responsible for all trading, portfolio construction and investment operations, noting that it was anticipated that the LCM personnel currently responsible for managing the Fund's portfolio would continue to manage the Fund on behalf of the proposed sub-adviser. The Board considered the Adviser's oversight process, noting that the firm intended to regularly engage with the Fund, the portfolio, and the sub-adviser, monitor compliance and portfolio construction on a daily basis, and conduct regular reviews of the sub-adviser. The Board concluded it was comfortable that the Adviser had the capabilities and resources to oversee the operations of the Fund. Based on their review, the Trustees concluded that, overall, the nature, extent and quality of services expected to be provided to the Fund were satisfactory.
Performance. The Board considered the Adviser's investment philosophy and experience and its history in managing investment companies, and it reviewed performance history of other funds managed by the Adviser, noting that they had shown generally positive returns and favorable Morningstar ratings. The Board also considered that the Adviser will delegate responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Fund to LCM, and LCM would continue to manage the Fund in the same manner once engaged as the Fund's sub-adviser.
Fees and Expenses. The Trustees reviewed information regarding fees charged by advisers to a peer group of funds with investment objectives and strategies comparable to the Fund's. The Trustees remarked that the proposed advisory fee of 1.35% was equal to the Fund's current advisory fee and was slightly less than the peer group average. The Trustees remarked that the proposed advisory fee, while higher than the US Closed-end Multialternative Morningstar category average, was still well within the range of fees charged by funds in that category. The Trustees also considered that the Adviser had agreed to maintain the Fund's current expense limitations of 1.95% of Class A shares' net assets, 2.45% of Class L shares' net assets, 2.70% of Class C shares' net assets and 1.70% of Class I shares' net assets. After further discussion, the Board concluded that the proposed advisory fee of 1.35% remained competitive and reasonable.
Economies of Scale. The Trustees considered whether the Adviser will realize economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund. The Trustees agreed that while meaningful economies of scale had not yet been reached, they would continue to monitor Fund growth and evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints in the advisory fee as Fund assets increase.
Profitability. The Trustees considered the projected profits by the Adviser in connection with the operation of the Fund for the first two years under the Proposed Advisory Agreement and whether the amount of profit would be a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the Fund. The Trustees noted that the Adviser expected to receive a reasonable profit both in terms of percentage of revenue and dollar amount over both years. The Board concluded that the Adviser's estimated level of profitability from its relationship with the Fund was not excessive.
15(f) Considerations. The Trustees noted that Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act provides a safe harbor to investment advisers who may receive compensation or benefits in connection with the sale of securities or a sale of any other interest in the investment adviser, which results in an assignment of an investment advisory contract. They further noted that the safe harbor is conditioned on the following: for a period of three years after the time of such sale, at least 75% of the board of trustees are not interested persons of the investment adviser, as the term is defined in the 1940 Act, and there is not imposed an unfair burden as a result of the sale. The Trustees noted that under Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, an unfair burden includes any arrangement, during the two year period after the time of such sale, whereby the investment adviser or corporate trustee or predecessor or successor investment advisers or corporate trustee or any interested person of any such adviser or any such corporate trustee receives or is entitled to receive any compensation directly or indirectly (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from, or on behalf of such company, other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for such company, or (ii) from such company or its security holders for other than bona fide investment advisory or other services. They noted that it was anticipated that after the Transaction, at least 75% of the Board of Trustees of the Fund would be independent. They also considered whether the retention of the Adviser will impose an unfair burden on the Fund's shareholders. After discussion, they concluded that the retention of the Adviser was unlikely to impose an unfair burden on the Fund's shareholders because after the Transaction, none of the Adviser, LCM, or any of their affiliates would be entitled to receive any compensation directly or indirectly (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from, or on behalf of the Fund (other than compensation received by an affiliated broker in connection with Fund portfolio transactions executed in compliance with Rule 17e-1), or (ii) from the Fund for other than bona fide investment advisory or other services.
Conclusion. Having requested and received such information from the Adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Proposed Advisory Agreement, and as assisted by the advice of counsel, the Board concluded that the advisory fee is reasonable and that approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Fund.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement.
PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL OF A NEW SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
DESTRA AND LCM 
Background
The primary purpose of this proposal is to enable LCM to serve as the investment sub-adviser to the Fund. As stated above in Proposal 1, while LCM serves as the Fund's current investment adviser, in September 2018, LCM notified the Trust that while LCM desired to continue to manage the Fund's portfolio, LCM believed that it would be in the best interests of Fund shareholders if (i) Destra replaced LCM as the Fund's principal investment adviser and (ii) LCM served the Fund as its sub-adviser. Further details regarding the benefits to shareholders, as well as to LCM, anticipated to come from this change in advisory structure caused by the Asset Transfer may be found above under the section entitled "Background" in Proposal 1.
As stated above, the 1940 Act requires that investment advisory agreements such as the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement be approved by shareholders. Therefore, shareholders are being asked to approve the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.
As noted under Proposal 1, the Fund is not a party to the Asset Purchase Agreement; however, the completion of the Asset Transfer is subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval of the Transaction. Therefore, if shareholders do not approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement and elect the Trustee nominees at the Meeting or if the other conditions in the Asset Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived, then the Asset Transfer will not be completed and the Asset Purchase Agreement will terminate.
The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement
Fees. Under the terms of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, LCM is entitled to receive an annual fee from Destra equal to 50% of the net revenue received by Destra after any fee waivers, subject to a maximum of 0.675% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
Services. For such compensation, LCM, shall, subject to the supervision and oversight of Destra, manage the investment and reinvestment of such portion of the assets of the Fund as Destra may from time to time allocate to the Sub-Adviser for management.
Term, Continuance and Termination. The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement:
Limitation on Liability. The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that LCM shall not be subject to any liability in connection with the performance of its services thereunder in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties.
For more complete information and for all of the provisions of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, please refer to the form of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as
Exhibit B. You should read the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement. The description in this Proxy Statement of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement is only a summary.
The effective date of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement would be on/or about December 1, 2018.
Information Concerning LCM
LCM is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of California and located at 13520 Evening Creek Drive N., Suite 300, San Diego, California 92128. LCM is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. LCM is owned and controlled by Raymond Lucia, Jr. and Joseph P. Lucia. LCM does not manage any other funds with principal investment strategies or objectives similar to those of the Fund.
The names, titles, addresses and principal occupations of the principal executive officers of LCM are set forth below:
(1) The address of each officer is 13520 Evening Creek Drive N., Suite 300, San Diego, CA 92128.
(2) Mr. Raymond J. Lucia, Jr. also serves as Interested Trustee and President of the Fund, and has done so since 2011.
Affiliate Fees
Lucia Securities, Inc. ("Lucia Securities") is a FINRA registered broker-dealer, is an affiliate of LCM, and provides wholesaling services to the Fund. Lucia Securities is an affiliate of LCM because both entities are under the common control of Raymond J. Lucia, Jr. The following table shows brokerage commissions and placement fees paid to Lucia Securities during the last five fiscal years ended February 28.
Evaluation by the Board of Trustees
At a meeting held on October 2, 2018, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, considered the approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement. In considering the approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Trustees received materials specifically relating to the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.
The Trustees considered the following material factors during their deliberations: (1) the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided by the Sub-Adviser; (2) the investment performance of the Fund and the Sub-Adviser; (3) the cost of services to be provided and the profits to be realized by the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates; (4) the extent to which economies of scale will be realized as the Fund grows; and (5) whether the fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of investors. The Trustees relied upon the advice of counsel and their own business judgment in determining the before-mentioned material factors to be considered in evaluating the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement and the weight to be given to each factor considered. The conclusions reached by the Trustees were based on a comprehensive evaluation of all of the information provided and were not the result of any one factor. Moreover, each Trustee may have afforded different weight to the various factors in reaching his or her conclusions with respect to the approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Nature, Extent and Quality of Service. The Trustees examined the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by the Sub-Adviser to the Fund. The Trustees noted their familiarity with LCM and its personnel because the firm currently served the Fund as its adviser. The Trustees expressed satisfaction with the overall historical management of the Fund, as well as with the continued evolution and growth of LCM's management team and investment process. The Trustees discussed the strategy of the Fund and its key risks, and they expressed the opinion that LCM is managing portfolio risks well. The Trustees discussed historical enhancements that LCM had made to its team and its portfolio management processes. The Trustees also discussed in detail the Sub-Adviser's research processes, noting that the firm thoroughly analyzed sponsor and manager capabilities and evaluated the quality of the underlying portfolios. They also evaluated LCM's proprietary multi-stage, multi-factor framework for selecting, evaluating and monitoring investment opportunities across different sectors and expressed their satisfaction with that process. The Trustees noted the Sub-Adviser had reported no material compliance incidents, litigation or administrative actions over the period in question. Overall, it was the consensus of the Trustees that they were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by LCM and anticipated that Fund shareholders would continue to receive the same quality of services from LCM when the firm was engaged as the Fund's sub-adviser.
Performance. The Trustees considered the Fund's past performance and the Fund's investment objective of seeking returns from capital appreciation and income, with an emphasis on the generation of income. The Trustees also reviewed the Fund's investment policy of maintaining a core allocation to alternative assets. The Trustees noted their satisfaction with the fact that the Fund had delivered positive annualized returns on a since-inception basis while simultaneously exhibiting lower overall risk metrics versus the S&P 500 Total Return Index over that period. They further noted that while the Fund underperformed the peer group over the past year, the Fund had substantially outperformed the Morningstar U.S. Closed-end Category average over the same time period. They also observed that the Fund's performance had been consistent with that of the peer group over the since inception time period. The Trustees noted that, since inception, consistent with the Fund's stated strategy, the Fund's performance was regularly between the returns of the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500 Total Return Index. The Trustees concluded that overall, the Fund was performing in line with its goals and objectives across a variety of market environments, and they agreed that the Fund's performance was satisfactory.
Fees and Expenses. The Trustees considered the proposed sub-advisory fee, noting that the contractual amount was equal to 50% of the net advisory fee earned by the Adviser. They observed that the sub-advisory fee would be paid by the Adviser, not the Fund, and concluded that the proposed sub-advisory fee was not unreasonable.
Economies of Scale. The Trustees considered whether the Sub-Adviser will experience economies of scale with respect to the managing of the Fund. The Trustees agreed that this was primarily an adviser level issue and should be considered with respect to the overall advisory contract, taking into consideration the impact of the sub-advisory expense. After discussion, it was the consensus of the Trustees that a lack of breakpoints was acceptable and the shareholders will benefit from lower overall expenses as the Fund grows.
Profitability. The Trustees considered the anticipated profits to be realized by the Sub-Adviser in connection with its relationship with the Fund and whether the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit with respect to the sub-advisory services to be provided to the Fund. The Trustees noted that the Sub-Adviser estimates realizing a loss during its first year of engagement as sub-adviser and only a slight profit during the second year of such engagement. The Trustees considered the quality of services anticipated to be provided by the Sub-Adviser, and they concluded the anticipated level of profit was not excessive.
15(f) Considerations. The Trustees noted that section 15(f) of the 1940 Act provides a safe harbor to investment advisers who may receive compensation or benefits in connection with the sale of securities or a sale of any other interest in the investment adviser, which results in an assignment of an investment advisory contract. They further noted that the safe harbor is conditioned on the following: for a period of three years after the time of such sale, at least 75% of the board of trustees are not interested persons of the investment, as the term is defined in the 1940 Act, and there is not imposed an unfair burden as a result of the sale. The Trustees noted that under Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, an unfair burden includes any arrangement, during the two year period after the time of such sale, whereby the investment adviser or corporate trustee or predecessor or successor investment advisers or corporate trustee or any interested person of any such adviser or any such corporate trustee receives or is entitled to receive any compensation directly or indirectly (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from, or on behalf of such company, other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for such company, or (ii) from such company or its security holders for other than bona fide investment advisory or other services. They considered that although LCM is not directly selling any interests in LCM to the Adviser, LCM and the Adviser have entered into a purchase agreement whereby LCM will receive compensation from Destra if Destra is retained as adviser to the Fund. They noted that it was anticipated that after the Transaction, at least 75% of the Board of Trustees of the Fund would be independent. They also considered whether the retention of the Sub-Adviser will impose an unfair burden on the Fund's shareholders. After discussion, they concluded that the retention of LCM was unlikely to impose an unfair burden on the Fund's shareholders because after the Transaction, none of the Adviser, LCM, or any of their affiliates would be entitled to receive any compensation directly or indirectly (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to, from, or on behalf of the Fund (other than compensation received by an affiliated broker in connection with Fund portfolio transactions executed in compliance with Rule 17e-1), or (ii) from the Fund for other than bona fide investment advisory or other services.
Conclusion. Having requested and received such information from the Sub-Adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, and as assisted by the advice of counsel, the Board concluded that the advisory fee is reasonable and that approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Fund.
The Board, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.
PROPOSAL 3
Approval of Election of 
NICHOLAS DALMASO, John S. Emrich, Michael S. Erickson and Jeffrey S. Murphy to the Board of Trustees
In this proposal, shareholders of the Fund are being asked to elect John S. Emrich, Michael S. Erickson, Jeffrey S. Murphy and Nicholas Dalmaso (each, a "Nominee") to the Board of Trustees of the Trust. Each Nominee has agreed to serve on the Board of Trustees for an indefinite term.
As noted under Proposal 1, the Fund is not a party to the Asset Purchase Agreement; however, the completion of the Asset Transfer is subject to certain conditions, including shareholder approval of the Transaction. Therefore, if shareholders do not approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement and elect the Trustee nominees at the Meeting or if the other conditions in the Asset Purchase Agreement are not satisfied or waived, then the Asset Transfer will not be completed and the Asset Purchase Agreement will terminate.
During a meeting held on October 2, 2018, the current Board, in reviewing the Proposed Advisory Agreement and Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, noted that the Fund would likely undergo changes in its operations, insofar as various functions will be performed by different organizations and personnel, were the Transaction to be completed. In this context, each Nominee was nominated for election to the Board by Darlene DeRemer, John Frager, and Mark Riedy, each of whom is an Independent Trustee, serving as an ad hoc nominating committee, and the Board, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously determined to submit each Nominee to the Fund's shareholders for election. The current Board noted these factors as consistent with good governance and that the transition to the Nominees was not likely to adversely affect the Fund. If the Nominees are elected by shareholders, (i) Mr. Emrich, Mr. Erickson and Mr. Murphy will be considered Independent Trustees; (ii) Mr. Dalmaso will be considered a Trustee who is an "interested person" as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, due to his affiliation with the Adviser, as further discussed below; (iii) all of the current Trustees (Raymond J. Lucia, Jr., Mark J. Riedy, Ira J. Miller, John D. Frager and Darlene T. DeRemer) will cease to be Trustees.
Information about the Nominees
Below is information about each Nominee and the attributes that qualify each to serve as a Trustee. The information provided below is not all-inclusive.

Mr. Lucia is an "interested person" as defined by the 1940 Act, by virtue of his position as President of the Trust and his controlling interest in the Adviser. The Board of Trustees is comprised of Mr. Lucia and four Independent Trustees. The Independent Trustees have not selected a Lead Independent Trustee. Additionally, under certain 1940 Act governance guidelines that apply to the Trust, the Independent Trustees will meet in executive session, at least quarterly. Under the Trust's Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, the Chairman of the Board/President is responsible for (a) presiding at board meetings, (b) calling special meetings on an as-needed basis, and, more generally, in-practice (c) execution and administration of Trust policies including (i) setting the agendas for Board meetings and (ii) providing information to Board members in advance of each Board meeting and between Board meetings. Generally, the Trust believes it best to have a single leader who is seen by shareholders, business partners and other stakeholders as providing strong leadership. The Trust believes that its Chairman/President together with the Audit Committee and the full Board of Trustees, provide effective leadership that is in the best interests of the Trust and Fund shareholders because of the Board's collective business acumen and understanding of the regulatory framework under which investment companies must operate. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the Board held five meetings.
Board Risk Oversight
The Board of Trustees is comprised of Mr. Lucia and four Independent Trustees with a standing independent Audit Committee with a separate chair. The Audit Committee is composed of only Independent Trustees. The Board is responsible for overseeing risk management, and the full Board regularly engages in discussions of risk management and receives compliance reports that inform its oversight of risk management from its Chief Compliance Officer at quarterly meetings and on an ad hoc basis, when and if necessary. The Audit Committee considers financial and reporting risk within its area of responsibilities. Generally, the Board believes that its oversight of material risks is adequately maintained through the compliance-reporting chain where the Chief Compliance Officer is the primary recipient and communicator of such risk-related information.
Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Board has an Audit Committee that consists of three Trustees, each of whom is not an "interested person" of the Trust within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Audit Committee's responsibilities include: (i) recommending to the Board the selection, retention or termination of the Trust's independent auditors; (ii) reviewing with the independent auditors the scope, performance and anticipated cost of their audit; (iii) discussing with the independent auditors certain matters relating to the Trust's financial statements, including any adjustment to such financial statements recommended by such independent auditors, or any other results of any audit; (iv) reviewing on a periodic basis a formal written statement from the independent auditors with respect to their independence, discussing with the independent auditors any relationships or services disclosed in the statement that may impact the objectivity and independence of the Trust's independent auditors and recommending that the Board take appropriate action in response thereto to satisfy itself of the auditor's independence; and (v) considering the comments of the independent auditors and management's responses thereto with respect to the quality and adequacy of the Trust's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices and internal controls. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to an Audit Committee Charter, which is available on the Fund's website at www.growthandincomefund.com. The Audit Committee generally will consider shareholder nominees to the extent required pursuant to rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and setting Independent Trustee compensation from time to time when considered necessary or appropriate. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the Audit Committee held two meetings.
With respect to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the Audit Committee has (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with Fund management; (ii) discussed with the Fund's independent auditors the matters to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") in Rule 3200T; (iii) received the written disclosures and the letter from the Fund's independent accountant required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence; and (iv) based on such reviews and discussions, recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Fund's annual report to shareholders required by Section 30(e) of the 1940 Act and filed with the SEC.
The Audit Committee members are Ira J. Miller, Darlene T. DeRemer and Mark J. Riedy.
Due to the size of the Board, the Board does not have a standing Nominating Committee. Rather, the Board has formed an ad hoc Nominating Committee, consisting of Darlene T. DeRemer, Mark Riedy, Ira Miller and John Frager, which is responsible for seeking and reviewing nominee candidates for consideration as Independent Trustees as is from time to time considered necessary or appropriate. The ad hoc Nominating Committee reviews all nominations of potential trustees made by Fund management and by Fund shareholders, which includes all information relating to the recommended nominees that is required to be disclosed in solicitations or proxy statements for the election of directors, including without limitation the biographical information and the qualifications of the proposed nominees. Shareholders interested in nominating potential trustees should submit their nominations to Emily Paup, Secretary, Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund, 80 Arkay Drive, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Nomination submissions must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by the shareholders, and such additional information must be provided regarding the recommended nominee as reasonably requested by the Audit Committee.
Nominee Ownership
The following table shows the dollar range of the Fund shares beneficially owned by each Nominee as of the Record Date:
Compensation
None of the Nominees has served as a Trustee of the Fund. Therefore, none of the Nominees has received any compensation from the Fund. Each Trustee Nominee who takes office with the Board will be paid by the Fund as a Trustee, including the Interested Trustee Nominee. If the Nominees are elected and take office, the new Board may establish a new compensation schedule for its Independent Trustees. The new compensation schedule for the Nominees may take into account their services provided to other funds in the Destra Fund complex, if any.
During the last fiscal year, none of the Fund's officers received any compensation from the Fund.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" the election of each Nominee to the Board of Trustees.
PROPOSAL 4
Approval of A CHANGE IN the Fund's DIVERSIFICATION POLICY
Background
A "diversified company," under section 5(b)(1) of the 1940 Act, refers to a fund with the following characteristics: (i) at least 75% of the fund's total assets is represented by cash, government securities, securities of other investment companies, and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than (a) five percent of the total value of the fund and (b) 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer. By contrast, a "non-diversified company" refers to funds that are not "diversified companies."
Under section 13(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, a fund may not change from a diversified company to a non-diversified company unless authorized to do so by a vote of the majority of its outstanding securities.
Proposal to Change the Diversification Policy
The Fund, upon launch, identified itself in its registration statement as a non-diversified company. Nevertheless, the Fund, for a period of more than three years after launch, operated as a diversified company. It is the position of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that any fund that has registered as non-diversified, but which in fact operates as a diversified company for more than three years, has changed its status to that of a diversified company and must, under section 13(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, seek shareholder approval before recommencing operations as a non-diversified company.
As a result, the Trust is seeking shareholder approval to change the Fund's diversification policy from "diversified" to "non-diversified". The Trust believes that such a change would be in the best interests of shareholders because it would provide more flexibility in constructing the Fund's portfolio, potentially allowing the Fund to invest more assets in attractive opportunities than might otherwise be possible if the Fund were subject to the constraints of a diversified company as summarized above.
As a non-diversified fund, the Fund will not be subject to the constraints of a diversified company. This means, for example, that the Fund will be able to invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of one or more issuers or hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of an issuer. As such, the Fund's performance may be more sensitive to any single economic, business, political or regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" the proposed change to the Fund's diversification policy.
OTHER INFORMATION

The Trust's principal executive offices are located at c/o Gemini Fund Services, LLC, 80 Arkay Drive, Hauppauge, NY 11788, and its telephone number is 1-855-601-3841.

Northern Light Distributors, LLC, located at 17605 Wright Street, Omaha, NE 68130, serves as the Fund's principal underwriter and acts as the distributor of the Fund's shares.

THE PROXY
The Board solicits proxies so that each shareholder has the opportunity to vote on the proposals to be considered at the Meeting. A proxy for voting your shares at the Meeting is enclosed. The shares represented by each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the Meeting as specified. If no specification is made, the shares represented by a duly executed proxy will be voted (i) for approval of Proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4; and (ii) at the discretion of the holder(s) of the proxy on any other matter that may come before the Meeting that the Fund did not have notice of by a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (i) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, (ii) submitting a written notice to the Secretary of the Fund revoking the proxy, or (iii) attending and voting in person at the Meeting.
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING
As of the Record Date, the following numbers of shares of beneficial interest of the Fund were issued and outstanding:
All shareholders of record of the Fund on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Meeting on each Proposal. Each shareholder is entitled to one (1) vote per share held, and fractional votes for fractional shares held, on any matter submitted to a vote at the Meeting. There are no dissenters' rights of appraisal in connection with any shareholder vote to be taken at the Meeting.
Approval of Proposals 1, 2 and 4
An affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for the approval of Proposals 1, 2 and 4. As defined in the 1940 Act, a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund means the vote of (1) 67% or more of the voting shares of the Fund present at the meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the Fund, whichever is less. For Proposals 1, 2 and 4, the presence at the Meeting of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting (in person or by proxy) constitutes a quorum.
When a proxy is returned as an abstention or "broker non-vote" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees, typically in "street name," as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter), the shares represented by the proxy will be treated as present for purposes of determining a quorum and as votes against Proposal 1, 2 and 4. In addition, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), if a broker has not received instructions from beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the proposal to be voted upon may
"affect substantially" a shareholder's rights or privileges, the broker may not vote the shares as to that proposal even if it has discretionary voting power. The NYSE considers Proposals 1, 2 and 4 to be non-routine matters that affect substantially a shareholder's rights or privileges. As a result, these shares also will be treated as broker non-votes for purposes of Proposals 1, 2 and 4 (but will not be treated as broker non-votes for other proposals, including adjournment of the special meeting).
Treating broker non-votes as votes against Proposals 1, 2 and 4 may result in one or more of these proposals not being approved, even though the votes cast in favor would have been sufficient to approve the proposal if some or all of the broker non-votes had been withheld.
Approval of Proposal 3
Approval of Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of all votes at the Meeting. Under this plurality system, Trustee positions are filled by the nominees who receive the largest number of votes, with no majority approval requirement, until all vacancies are filled. Because Trustees are elected by a plurality, non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on Proposal 3. For Proposal 3, the holders of thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the outstanding shares of the Fund (including broker non-votes and abstentions) entitled to vote at the meeting (in person or by proxy) constitutes a quorum.
The Transaction is contingent upon each of Proposals 1, 2 and 3 being approved by shareholders of the Fund. If Proposals 1, 2 and 3 are not approved by shareholders of the Fund, the Transaction will not be completed.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
The Fund has not received any shareholder proposals to be considered for presentation at the Meeting. Under the proxy rules of the SEC, shareholder proposals may, under certain conditions, be included in the Fund's Proxy Statement and proxy for a particular meeting. Under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials must be received by the Fund within a reasonable time before the solicitation is made. The fact that the Fund receives a shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not ensure its inclusion in its proxy materials, because there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion. You should be aware that annual meetings of shareholders are not required as long as there is no particular requirement under the 1940 Act that must be met by convening such a shareholder meeting. Any shareholder proposal should be sent to Multi-Strategy Growth & Income Fund, Attention: Emily Paup, Secretary, 80 Arkay Drive, Hauppauge, NY 11788. Shareholder proposals may also be raised from the floor at the Meeting without prior notice to the Trust.
COST OF SOLICITATION
The Board of Trustees is making this solicitation of proxies. The Fund has engaged AST Fund Solutions, a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation. The estimated fees anticipated to be paid to AST Fund Solutions are approximately $51,000. The cost of preparing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and proxy and any additional materials relating to the Meeting and the cost of soliciting proxies will be borne equally by Destra and LCM. In addition to solicitation by mail, the Fund will request the insurance companies, banks, brokers and other custodial nominees and fiduciaries, to supply proxy materials to the respective beneficial owners of shares of the Fund of whom they have knowledge, and Destra and LCM will reimburse them for their expenses in so doing. Certain officers, employees and agents of the Fund and LCM may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, facsimile transmission, or mail, for which they will not receive any special compensation.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board knows of no other matter to be presented at the Meeting other than as set forth above. If any other matter properly comes before the Meeting that the Trust did not have notice of by a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement, the holders of the proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment, and discretionary authority to do so is included in the proxy.

PROPOSED ADVISORY AGREEMENT
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
Destra Alternative Access Fund
AGREEMENT made this ___ day of __________, 2018, by and between Destra Alternative Access Fund, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Fund"), and Destra Capital Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Advisor").
WHEREAS, the Fund is a closed-end, management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act");
WHEREAS, the Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Advisers Act") and is engaged in the business of supplying investment advice as an independent contractor; and
WHEREAS, the Fund desires to retain the Advisor to render investment management services with respect to the Fund and the Advisor is willing to render such services:
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1. APPOINTMENT AND ACCEPTANCE. The Fund hereby appoints the Advisor to act as Advisor to the Fund for the period and on the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Advisor accepts such appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided.
2. DUTIES OF ADVISOR. The Fund employs the Advisor to furnish and manage a continuous investment program for the Fund. The Advisor will continuously review, supervise and (where appropriate) administer the investment program of the Fund, to (i) determine in its discretion (where appropriate) the securities to be purchased, held, sold or exchanged, (ii) provide the Fund with records concerning the Advisor's activities which the Fund is required to maintain and (iii) render regular reports to the Fund's officers and Trustees concerning the Advisor's discharge of the foregoing responsibilities. The Advisor may hire (subject to the approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees ("Board") and, except as otherwise permitted under the terms of any applicable exemptive relief obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission, or by rule or regulation, a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund) and thereafter supervise the investment activities of one or more sub-advisers deemed necessary to carry out the investment program of the Fund. The retention of a sub-adviser by the Advisor shall not relieve the Advisor of its responsibilities under this Agreement.
The Advisor shall discharge the foregoing responsibilities subject to the control of the Fund's Board and in compliance with such policies as the Board may from time to time establish, with the objectives, policies, and limitations for the Fund set forth in the Fund's registration statement as amended from time to time, and with applicable laws and regulations.

The Advisor will promptly communicate to the officers and the Board such information relating to portfolio transactions as they may reasonably request.
It is understood that the Advisor will not be deemed to have acted unlawfully, or to have breached a fiduciary duty to the Fund or be in breach of any obligation owing to the Fund under this Agreement, or otherwise, by reason of its having directed a securities transaction on behalf of the Fund to a broker-dealer in compliance with the provisions of
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or as described from time to time by the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information.
4. EXPENSES

(c)       The Advisor may voluntarily or contractually absorb certain Fund expenses.
(d)       To the extent the Advisor incurs any costs by assuming expenses which are an obligation of the Fund as set forth herein, the Fund shall promptly reimburse the Advisor for such costs and expenses, except to the extent the Advisor has otherwise agreed to bear such expenses. To the extent the services for which the Fund is obligated to pay are performed by the Advisor, the Advisor shall be entitled to recover costs from the Fund to the extent of the Advisor's actual costs for providing such services. In determining the Advisor's actual costs, the Advisor may take into account an allocated portion of the salaries and overhead of personnel performing such services.
5.       COMPENSATION OF THE ADVISOR. For the services provided and the expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund shall pay to the Advisor compensation at an annual rate of 1.35%, payable monthly in arrears by the 10th business day of the succeeding month, based upon the Fund's average daily net assets as of month-end.

The Advisor will pay the compensation of any sub-adviser retained pursuant to Section 2 above.
The Advisor may, in its discretion and from time to time, reduce any portion of the compensation or reimbursement of expenses due to it pursuant to this Agreement and may agree to make payments to limit the expenses that are the responsibility of the Fund under this Agreement. Any such reduction or payment shall be applicable only to such specific reduction or payment and shall not constitute an agreement to reduce any future compensation or reimbursement due to the Advisor hereunder or to continue future payments.
All rights of compensation under this Agreement for services performed as of the termination date shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
6. BOOKS AND RECORDS. The Advisor will maintain all books and records with respect to the securities transactions of the Fund and will furnish to the Fund's Board such periodic and special reports as the Board may reasonably request. The Fund and the Advisor agree to furnish to each other, if applicable, current registration statements, proxy statements, reports to shareholders, certified copies of their financial statements, and such other information with regard to their affairs as each may reasonably request.
Any records required to be maintained and preserved pursuant to the provisions of Rule 31a-1 and Rule 31a-2 promulgated under the 1940 Act which are prepared or maintained by the Advisor on behalf of the Fund are the property of the Fund and will be surrendered promptly to the Fund on request.
7. STATUS OF ADVISOR. The services of the Advisor to the Fund are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Advisor shall be free to render similar services to others so long as its services to the Fund are not impaired thereby. The Advisor shall be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent the Fund in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund.
8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF ADVISOR.
(a) In the absence of willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations to the Fund, the Advisor and any partner, director, officer or employee of the Advisor, or any of their affiliates, executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives, will not be liable for any error of judgment, mistake of law or for any act or omission by the person in connection with the performance of services to the Fund, except as may otherwise be provided under provisions of applicable state law or Federal securities law which cannot be waived or modified hereby.
(b) The Fund shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Advisor, or any member, manager, officer or employee of the Advisor, and any of their affiliates, executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives, against any liability or expense to which the person may be liable that arises in connection with the performance of services to the Fund, so long as the liability or expense is not incurred by reason of the person's willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations to the Fund. The rights of indemnification provided under this Section shall not be construed so as to provide for indemnification of any aforementioned persons for any losses (including any liability under Federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but shall be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this Section  to the fullest extent permitted by law.
(c) The Advisor shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Fund and all controlling persons of the Fund (as described in Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), against any liability or expense to which the person may be liable that arises in connection with the performance of services to the Advisor, so long as the liability or expense is not incurred by reason of the person's willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its obligations to the Advisor. The rights of indemnification provided under this Section shall not be construed so as to provide for indemnification of any aforementioned persons for any losses (including any liability under Federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but shall be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this Section  to the fullest extent permitted by law.
9. PERMISSIBLE INTERESTS. Trustees, agents, and interest holders of the Fund are or may be interested in the Advisor (or any successor thereof) as members, managers, officers, or interest holders, or otherwise; members, managers, officers, agents, and interest holders of the Advisor are or may be interested in the Fund as Trustees, interest holders or otherwise; and the Advisor (or any successor) is or may be interested in the Fund as an interest holder or otherwise. In addition, brokerage transactions for the Fund may be effected through affiliates of the Advisor, provided the Advisor has broker-dealer affiliates, if approved by the Fund's Board, subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
10. AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICT. The Advisor represents, warrants and agrees that: it has the authority to enter into and perform the services contemplated by this Agreement; and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement do not, and will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or default under, any agreement to which Advisor or any of its affiliates are a party.
11. LICENSE OF ADVISOR'S NAME. The parties agree that the name of the Advisor, the names of any affiliates of the Advisor and any derivative or logo or trademark or service mark or trade name are the valuable property of the Advisor and its affiliates. The Advisor hereby agrees to grant a license to the Fund for use of its name in the name of the Fund for the term of this Agreement and such license shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement. If the Fund makes any unauthorized use of the Advisor's names, derivatives, logos, trademarks, or service marks or trade names, the parties acknowledge that the Advisor shall suffer irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be inadequate and thus, the Advisor shall be entitled to injunctive relief, as well as any other remedy available under law.
12. DURATION AND TERMINATION. This Agreement, unless sooner terminated as provided herein, shall remain in effect until two years from the effective date of the Agreement and thereafter, may continue in effect only if such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a majority of those Trustees of the Board who are not parties to this Agreement or interested persons of any party to this Agreement, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, and (b) by a vote of a majority of the Fund's Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; provided, however, that if the interest holders of any Fund fail to approve the Agreement as provided herein, the Advisor may continue to serve hereunder in the manner and to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and rules and regulations thereunder. The foregoing requirement that continuance of this Agreement be "specifically approved at least annually" shall be construed in a manner consistent with the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated as to the Fund at any time, without the payment of any penalty by vote of a majority of members of the Fund's Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund on sixty (60) days written notice to the Advisor, or by the Advisor at any time without the payment of any penalty, on sixty (60) days written notice to the Fund. This Agreement will automatically and immediately terminate in the event of its assignment. Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party at any office of such party.

1.             APPOINTMENT OF THE SUB-ADVISER
The Advisor hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to act as an investment adviser for the Fund, subject to the supervision and oversight of the Advisor and the Trustees of the Fund, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The Sub-Adviser will be an independent contractor and will have no authority to act for or represent the Fund or the Advisor in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of the Fund or the Advisor except as expressly authorized in this Agreement or another writing by the Fund, the Advisor and the Sub-Adviser.

3.             SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BY THE SUB-ADVISER TO THE FUND
A.           As an investment adviser to the Fund, the Sub-Adviser shall, subject to the supervision and oversight of the Advisor, manage the investment and reinvestment of such portion of the assets of the Fund as the Advisor may from time to time allocate to the Sub-Adviser for management (the "Sub-Advised Assets"), as well as vote all proxies related to the Sub-Advised Assets.
B.           As part of the services it will provide hereunder, the Sub-Adviser will:
(i)           obtain and evaluate, to the extent deemed necessary and advisable by the Sub-Adviser in its discretion, pertinent economic, statistical, financial, and other information affecting the economy generally and individual companies or industries, the securities of which are included in the Sub-Advised Assets or are under consideration for inclusion in the Sub-Advised Assets;

(iii)           take whatever steps are necessary to implement the investment program for the Sub-Advised Assets by arranging for the purchase and sale of securities and other investments, including issuing directives to the administrator of the Fund as necessary for the appropriate implementation of the investment program of the Sub-Advised Assets;
(iv)           keep the Trustees of the Fund and the Adviser fully informed in writing on an ongoing basis as agreed by the Advisor and the Sub-Adviser as to (1) all material facts concerning the investment and reinvestment of the Sub-Advised Assets and (2) the Sub-Adviser and its key investment personnel and operations, make regular and periodic special written reports of such additional information concerning the same as may reasonably be requested from time to time by the Advisor or the Trustees of the Fund; and attend meetings with the Advisor and/or the Trustees, as reasonably requested, to discuss the foregoing;
(v)           in accordance with procedures and methods established by the Trustees of the Fund, which may be amended from time to time, provide assistance in determining the fair value of all securities and other investments/assets within the Sub-Advised Assets;
(vi)           provide any and all material composite performance information, records and supporting documentation about accounts the Sub-Adviser manages, if appropriate, which are relevant to the Fund and that have investment objectives, policies, and strategies substantially similar to those employed by the Sub-Adviser in managing the Sub-Advised Assets that may be reasonably necessary, under applicable laws, to allow the Fund or its agent to present information concerning the Sub-Adviser's prior performance in the Fund's Registration Statement and any permissible reports and materials prepared by the Fund;
(vii)        cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to the Adviser, the Fund's administrator, the Fund's custodian and foreign custodians, the Fund's transfer agent and pricing agents and all other agents and representatives of the Fund and the Adviser; keep all such persons fully informed as to such matters as they may reasonably deem necessary to the performance of their obligations to the Fund and the Adviser; provide prompt responses to reasonable requests made by such persons; and maintain any appropriate interfaces with each such person so as to promote the efficient exchange of information; and
(viii)       file any required reports with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(f) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
C.           In furnishing services hereunder, the Sub-Adviser shall be subject to, and shall perform in accordance with, the following:  (i) the Fund's declaration of trust, by-laws and/or other governing instruments, as the same may be hereafter modified and/or amended from time to time ("Governing Documents"); (ii) the currently effective Registration Statement and any amendments thereto; (iii) the Investment Company Act and the Advisers Act and the rules under each, and all other federal and state laws or regulations applicable to the Fund; (iv) the Fund's compliance manual and other policies and procedures adopted from time to time by the Board of Trustees of the Fund; and (v) the instructions of the Advisor.  Prior to the commencement of the Sub-Adviser's services hereunder, the Advisor shall provide the Sub-Adviser with current copies of any Governing Documents, Registration Statement, compliance manual and other relevant policies and procedures that are adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund.  The Advisor undertakes to provide the Sub-Adviser with copies or other written notice of any amendments, modifications or supplements to any such above-mentioned document.
D.           The Sub-Adviser, at its expense, will furnish:  (i) all necessary facilities (including office space, furnishings, and equipment) and personnel, including salaries, expenses and fees of any personnel required for the Sub-Adviser to faithfully perform its duties under this Agreement; and (ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, and all equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the Sub-Adviser's duties under this Agreement.
E.           On occasions when the Sub-Adviser deems the purchase of a security to be in the best interest of the Fund as well as other clients of the Sub-Adviser, allocation of the securities so purchased, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Sub-Adviser in the manner which the Sub-Adviser considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to its other clients over time.  The Advisor agrees that the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates may give advice and take action in the performance of their duties with respect to any of their other clients that may differ from advice given, or the timing or nature of actions taken, with respect to the Fund.  The Advisor also acknowledges that the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates are fiduciaries to other entities, some of which have the same or similar investment objectives (and will hold the same or similar investments) as the Fund, and that the Sub-Adviser will carry out its duties hereunder together with its duties under such relationships.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon the Sub-Adviser any obligation to purchase or to recommend for purchase for the Fund any investment that the Sub-Adviser, its affiliates, officers or employees may purchase or sell for its or their own account or for the account of any client, if in the sole and absolute discretion of the Sub-Adviser it is for any reason impractical or undesirable to take such action or make such recommendation for the Fund.
F.           The Sub-Adviser will maintain all accounts, books and records with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets as are required of an investment adviser of a registered investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act and Advisers Act and the rules thereunder.
4.             COMPENSATION OF THE SUB-ADVISER
The Advisor will pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly advisory fee with respect to the Sub-Advised Assets equal to a percentage of the "net advisory fee", which is the amount of the Advisor's advisory fee less (i) any fee waiver or expense reimbursement made by the Adviser in connection with the services provided under the Investment Management Agreement, and (ii) any other expenses agreed to be shared by the parties, shall be allocated 50% to the Sub-Adviser for the services provided pursuant to this Agreement and 50% to the Adviser. The amount allocated to the Sub-Adviser ("Sub-Advisory Fee") shall not exceed an annual rate of 0.675% based upon the Fund's average daily net assets at month end. In the case of a partial month, compensation will be based on the number of days during the month in which the Advisor provided services to the Fund. The Sub-Advisory Fee will be paid by the Advisor no later than the 45th day following receipt by the Advisor of the Advisory Fee from the Fund.
Except as may otherwise be prohibited by law or regulation (including, without limitation, any then current SEC staff interpretation), the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion and from time to time, waive all or any portion of its advisory fee. 
5.             LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION
A.           Except as may otherwise be provided by the Investment Company Act or any other federal securities law, neither the Sub-Adviser nor any of its officers, directors, partners, members or employees (its "Affiliates") shall be liable for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including legal and other expenses) incurred or suffered by the Advisor or the Fund as a result of any error of judgment or mistake of law by the Sub-Adviser or its Affiliates with respect to the Fund, except that nothing in this Agreement shall operate or purport to operate in any way to exculpate, waive or limit the liability of the Sub-Adviser or its Affiliates for, and the Sub-Adviser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Fund, the Advisor, all affiliated persons thereof (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act) and all controlling persons (as described in Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act")) (collectively, "Advisor Indemnitees") against, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including reasonable legal and other expenses) to which any of the Advisor Indemnitees may become subject under the 1933 Act, the Investment Company Act, the Advisers Act, or under any other statute, at common law or otherwise arising out of or based on (i) any willful misconduct, bad faith, reckless disregard or gross negligence of the Sub-Adviser in the performance of any of its duties or obligations hereunder or (ii) any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement, proxy materials, reports, advertisements, sales literature, or other materials pertaining to the Fund or the omission to state therein a material fact known to the Sub-Adviser which was required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon written information furnished to the Advisor or the Fund by the Sub-Adviser Indemnitees (as defined below) for use therein.
B.

19.           SEVERABILITY
Should any portion of this Agreement for any reason be held to be void in law or in equity, the Agreement shall be construed, insofar as is possible, as if such portion had never been contained herein.
20.           GOVERNING LAW
The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of law or choice of law doctrines, or any of the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act.  To the extent that the laws of the State of Delaware, or any of the provisions in this Agreement, conflict with applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act, the latter shall control.

Any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the Investment Company Act shall be resolved by reference to such term or provision of the Investment Company Act and to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United States courts or, in the absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the SEC validly issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act.  Specifically, the terms "vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities," "interested persons," "assignment," and "affiliated persons," as used herein shall have the meanings assigned to them by Section 2(a) of the Investment Company Act.  In addition, where the effect of a requirement of the Investment Company Act reflected in any provision of this Agreement is relaxed by a rule, regulation or order of the SEC, whether of special or of general application, such provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order.
