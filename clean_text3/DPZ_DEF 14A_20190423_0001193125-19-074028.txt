Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 23, 2019: The accompanying Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report are available at www.biz.dominos.com. In addition, you may access these materials at http://materials.proxyvote.com/25754A. On March 14, 2019, we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to certain shareholders, containing instructions for voting online and for requesting a paper copy of the Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report. 
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT 
We are offering registered shareholders the opportunity to vote their shares electronically through the Internet or by telephone. Please see the Proxy Statement and the enclosed Proxy for details about electronic voting. You are urged to date, sign and promptly return the enclosed Proxy, or to vote electronically through the Internet or by telephone, so that your shares may be voted in accordance with your wishes and so that the presence of a quorum may be assured. Voting promptly, regardless of the number of shares you hold, will aid the Company in reducing the expense of additional Proxy solicitation. You may revoke your Proxy at any time, regardless of your voting method, as fully described on page 4 of the accompanying Proxy Statement. 
Voting your shares by the enclosed Proxy, or electronically, does not affect your right to vote in person in the event you attend the meeting. You are cordially invited to attend the meeting, and the Company requests that you indicate your plans in this respect in the space provided on the enclosed form of Proxy or as prompted if you vote electronically. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, trust, bank or other nominee, you will need to bring a proxy or letter from that broker, trust, bank or nominee that confirms you are the beneficial owner of those shares.

Record Date, Issued and Outstanding Shares 
The record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting was the close of business on March 1, 2019 (the "Record Date"). On the Record Date, there were 41,063,231 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, the Company's only voting securities, outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. 
Quorum Requirement 
Under the Company's By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy, including shares that abstain or do not vote with respect to one or more of the matters presented for shareholder approval, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
Voting Procedures 
The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any proposal presented at the Annual Meeting. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment thereof. Shareholders may choose to vote by any of the following methods: (i) by returning the enclosed Proxy card, (ii) electronically by accessing the Internet site or by using the toll-free telephone number, both of which are stated on the form of Proxy, or (iii) by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
All properly executed Proxies received by mail, and properly authenticated electronic votes recorded through the Internet or by telephone, will be voted as directed by the shareholder. All properly executed Proxies received by mail that do not specify how shares should be voted will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation ("FOR" the election of all director nominees under Proposal One, "FOR" Proposal Two and "FOR" Proposal Three). 
Revocation of Proxies 
Any Proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked at any time before it is voted by: (i) signing and returning a new Proxy card with a later date, (ii) submitting a later-dated vote by telephone or via the Internet, (iii) filing with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation dated later than the date of the Proxy being revoked, or (iv) attending the Annual Meeting and revoking or voting in person. Any written notice of revocation should be sent to: Corporate Secretary, Domino's Pizza, Inc., 30 Frank Lloyd Wright Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. 
The Internet and telephone procedures for voting and for revoking or changing a vote are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to give their voting instructions and to confirm that shareholders' instructions have been properly recorded. Shareholders that vote through the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which will be borne by the shareholder. 
Broker Non-Votes 
Brokers are subject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). The NYSE rules direct that certain matters submitted to a vote of shareholders are "routine" items and brokers generally may vote on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions, subject to the rules of the NYSE concerning transmission of proxy materials to beneficial owners, and subject to any proxy voting policies and procedures of those brokerage firms. Brokers who hold shares in "street name" for customers who are beneficial owners of such shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote such customers' shares on "non-routine" matters in the absence of specific instructions from such customers. 
Under the current NYSE rules, we believe Proposal Two is a routine matter. Accordingly, if your broker holds shares that you own in street name, the broker may vote your shares on Proposal Two even if the broker does not receive instructions from you. We believe Proposal One and Proposal Three are non-routine matters and, therefore, the broker

 may not vote your shares on such proposals without receiving instructions from you. If your broker does not vote on a proposal, this is commonly referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes will not be counted as having been voted in person or by proxy, but pursuant to Delaware corporate law, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
Votes Required 
Under Proposal One, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of common stock represented and voted at the Annual Meeting. If you withhold your vote for a particular nominee, then your vote will not count "FOR" such nominee. Broker non-votes and votes withheld will not be treated as votes cast with respect to the election of directors and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. 
In addition, we have implemented a Majority Voting Policy for uncontested director elections (elections in which the number of nominees for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected). In the event that the votes "WITHHELD" from a nominee's election exceed the votes cast "FOR" that nominee's election, such nominee shall be required to submit his or her resignation to the Board of Directors for consideration. The Board of Directors will then have the opportunity to determine whether to accept or reject such tendered resignation. The Board of Directors, in making its decision, may consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate or relevant. 
The Board of Directors will act within 120 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Thereafter, the Board of Directors will promptly publicly disclose, in a report furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), its decision regarding the tendered resignation, including its rationale for accepting or rejecting the tendered resignation. The Board of Directors may accept a director's resignation or reject the resignation. If the Board of Directors accepts a director's resignation, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors, in each case pursuant to our Bylaws. If a director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. 
Approval of Proposal Two (ratification of independent registered public accountants) and Proposal Three (say-on-pay) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, and abstentions will not be treated as votes cast with respect to these proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the votes. 
No matter is currently expected to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than those listed in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting for action, it is intended that the persons named in the proxy and acting thereunder will vote in accordance with their discretion on such matters.

The Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, requires that all directors stand for annual election. Accordingly, the nine individuals listed below are standing for election to terms ending with the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, until his or her successor is elected or qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. Each nominee is currently serving as a director. Each nominee has indicated his or her willingness to serve, if elected. However, if a nominee should be unable to serve, the shares of common stock represented by Proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. Management has no reason to believe that any of the above-mentioned persons will not serve his or her term as a director.

Domino's has a commitment to strong corporate governance practices. These practices provide a framework within which the Company's Board and management can pursue the strategic objectives of Domino's and seek to ensure its long-term growth for the benefit of shareholders. The Company's corporate governance principles and practices are reviewed annually by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and any changes are recommended to the Board for approval. The Company's Corporate Governance Principles are posted on Domino's corporate and investor website biz.dominos.com under the Investors—Profile—Corporate Governance section and are available free of charge upon request from the Company's Corporate Secretary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, the Compensation Committee Charter and the Audit Committee Charter are also posted on the Company's corporate and investor website ("Investors—Profile—Corporate Governance" section on biz.dominos.com). All the referenced charters and the other documents referenced herein are available free of charge upon request from the Company's Corporate Secretary. 
The Corporate Governance Principles and the Charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee set forth the Company's policies with respect to Board structure, membership (including nominee qualifications), performance, operations and management oversight. Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Principles, the Board meets at least quarterly in an independent director session, an executive session and in a non-management executive session. The current discussion leader for the executive session is generally Mr. Brandon and the current discussion leader for the independent director session is generally Mr. Balson. The independent directors meet separately at each quarterly Board meeting. 
The entire Board of Directors is engaged in risk management oversight. At the present time, the Board has not established a separate committee to facilitate its risk oversight responsibilities. The Board will continue to monitor and assess whether such a committee would be appropriate. In accordance with the NYSE listed company rules, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of Domino's company-wide risk management and the process established to identify, measure, monitor, and manage risks, in particular major financial and cybersecurity risks. The Board of Directors receives regular reports from management, as well as from the Audit Committee and other standing committees regarding relevant risks and the actions taken by management to address those risks. 
The Company is required to have a majority of its Board be independent directors. The Company's Corporate Governance Principles contain the Company's standards for director independence. A director will be designated as independent if he or she (i) has no material relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) satisfies the other criteria specified by the NYSE listed company rules, (iii) has no business conflict with the Company or its subsidiaries and (iv) otherwise meets applicable independence criteria specified by law, regulation, exchange requirement or the Board. The Board has affirmatively determined that the following directors who served in the 2018 fiscal year were independent under that definition: 
C. Andrew Ballard 
Andrew B. Balson 
Corie S. Barry 
Diana F. Cantor 
Richard L. Federico 
James A. Goldman 
Patricia E. Lopez 
The Corporate Governance Principles further provide that the directors are invited and expected to attend the Company's annual meetings of shareholders. All directors serving at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders attended the meeting. 
The Company has adopted a Code of Professional Conduct for Senior Financial Officers that applies to all executive officers of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as all of the Company's other financial officers and other employees with senior financial roles. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees that applies to all directors, officers and employees. The Code of Professional Conduct and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are posted on the Company's corporate

The Company intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to, or waiver of, a provision of the Code of Professional Conduct for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Controller or persons performing similar functions, by posting such information on its website. 
A total of six meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company were held during 2018, and the Board acted via unanimous written consent on two other occasions. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which that director served, during the period each served as a director. 
In accordance with the NYSE requirements, the Board has a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a Compensation Committee and an Audit Committee, all of which are comprised solely of independent directors, as defined by Section 303A of the NYSE listed company rules and other applicable independence standards. Each committee of the Board has designated responsibilities and regularly reports on their activities to the entire Board. 
The Company's current leadership structure, as established in March 2010, separates the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles into two positions. David A. Brandon is the Chairman of the Board and Richard E. Allison, Jr. is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company has determined what leadership structure it deems appropriate based on factors such as the experience of the applicable individuals, the current business environment of the Company, and other relevant criteria. After considering these factors, the Company determined that separating the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is the appropriate leadership structure. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the strategic direction of the Company and the day-to-day leadership and performance of the Company, while the Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer, sets the agenda for the Board meetings and presides over meetings of the Board. The Company and the Board believe that this is appropriate under current circumstances, because it allows management to make the operating decisions necessary to manage the business, while helping to keep a measure of independence between the oversight function of our Board of Directors and operating decisions. The Company and the Board feel that this division provides an appropriate balance of operational focus, flexibility and oversight and decided to continue this approach after the transition from Mr. Doyle to Mr. Allison as the Company's Chief Executive Officer. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee were Messrs. Goldman (Chairperson) and Ballard and Ms. Cantor. The independence of each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is determined annually by the full Board of Directors in accordance with Section 303A.05 of the NYSE listed company rules. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met two times during 2018. A Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, as approved by the Board, reflects the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's responsibilities, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the charter at least once annually. The charter was last reviewed in October 2018 and can be found on the Company's corporate and investor website ("Investors— Profile—Corporate Governance" section on biz.dominos.com). 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's functions include assisting the Board in determining the desired qualifications of directors, identifying potential individuals meeting those qualifications, proposing to the Board a slate of nominees for election by the shareholders and reviewing candidates nominated by shareholders. In addition, further functions include reviewing the succession planning process for senior management of the Company, reviewing the Corporate Governance Principles, making recommendations to the Board with respect to other corporate governance principles applicable to the Company, recommending directors to serve on committees, overseeing the determinations of director independence, overseeing the annual evaluation of the Board and management and reviewing Board succession plans.

Evaluation of Director Candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets regularly to discuss, among other things, identification and evaluation of potential candidates for nomination as a director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may use a paid outside search firm or tools to identify possible directors, as was the case when it conducted a search for two new directors to be added to the Board in 2018. In addition to the experience, qualifications and skills for directors listed under Proposal One, director candidates will be evaluated according to the qualifications as set forth in the Board's Corporate Governance Principles, including the following desirable characteristics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• High personal and professional ethics, integrity and values;

[END TABLE]
Board Diversity. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a written policy regarding diversity in identifying director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers diversity in its search for the best candidates to serve on the Board of Directors. The Committee looks to incorporate diversity into the Board through a number of demographics, skills, experiences (including operational experience) and viewpoints, all with a view to identify candidates that can assist the Board with its decision-making. The Committee believes that the current composition of the Board of Directors reflects diversity based on a number of these factors. 
Shareholder Submission of Director Nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by shareholders for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, provided that the names of such nominees are submitted in writing, not later than February 23, 2020, to the Corporate Secretary of Domino's Pizza, Inc. at 30 Frank Lloyd Wright Drive, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. Each such submission must include a statement of the qualifications of the nominee, a consent signed by the nominee evidencing a willingness to serve as a director, if elected, and a commitment by the nominee to meet personally with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members. 
Other than the submission requirements set forth above, there are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates a nominee for director recommended by a shareholder. 
Compensation Committee 
The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Balson (Chairperson), Ballard and Federico. The independence of each member of the Compensation Committee is determined annually by the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 303A.05 of the NYSE listed company rules. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is independent. 
The Compensation Committee met three times during 2018 and acted via unanimous written consent on two other occasions, to conduct its required business in accordance with the Compensation Committee Charter. The Compensation Committee Charter authorizes the Compensation Committee to delegate any of its responsibilities to one or more subcommittees. The Compensation Committee Charter, as approved by the Board, reflects the Compensation Committee's responsibilities, and the Compensation Committee reviews the charter at least once annually. The charter was last reviewed in July 2018 and can be found on the Company's corporate and investor website ("Investors—Corporate Governance" section on biz.dominos.com).

Audit Committee 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the members of the Audit Committee were Ms. Cantor (Chairperson) and Messrs. Federico and Goldman. The independence of each member of the Audit Committee is determined annually by the full Board of Directors in accordance with Section 303A.05 of the NYSE listed company rules, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. The Board of Directors determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent. Additionally, the Board determined that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate as required by Section 303A.07(a) of the NYSE listed company rules, and that Ms. Cantor is an audit committee financial expert under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
The Audit Committee met five times during 2018. The Audit Committee Charter, as approved by the Board, reflects the Audit Committee's responsibilities, and the Audit Committee reviews the charter at least once annually. The charter was last reviewed in October 2018 and can be found on the Company's corporate and investor website ("Investors— Profile—Corporate Governance" section on biz.dominos.com). The Audit Committee's functions include: (i) providing assistance to the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the Company's independent registered public accountants, the Company's system of internal controls, the internal audit function and the Company's code of ethical conduct, (ii) retaining and, if appropriate, terminating the independent registered public accountants and (iii) approving audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accountants. 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy under which audit and non-audit services to be rendered by the Company's independent public registered accountants are pre-approved. All services provided to the Company by its independent public registered accountants for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. This policy can be found on the Company's corporate and investor website ("Investors— Profile—Corporate Governance" section on biz.dominos.com).

[END TABLE]
The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Report. 
The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter which was adopted by the Company's Board of Directors and is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the quality and integrity of the Company's accounting, auditing, financial reporting and internal control practices. The Audit Committee is responsible for, in addition to other activities, the appointment, retention and compensation of the Company's independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee has a policy with respect to the pre-approval of non-audit services. 
Each member of the Audit Committee was determined to be independent as required under the NYSE listed company rules, including those rules applicable to audit committee members. The Board determined that one of its members during fiscal 2018, Ms. Cantor, is an audit committee financial expert under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee met five times during 2018. 
In performing its responsibilities, the Audit Committee, in addition to other activities: (i) reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management, (ii) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accountants, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") AS 1301 (Communications With Audit Committees), as modified or supplemented, and (iii) received the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the firm's independence. Based on these reviews, discussions and activities, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was compatible with maintaining such firm's independence. After reviewing the services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, including all non-audit services, the Audit Committee, in accordance with its charter, authorized the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accountants of the Company, with such reappointment to be ratified by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting.

The Company's Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accountants of the Company for the current fiscal year. Management expects that representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in person or by proxy is necessary to ratify the selection of the Company's independent registered public accountants for the current year. Under applicable law, listed company rules and the Company's By-Laws, abstentions are not counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons named in the Proxy will vote all Proxies in favor of ratification. If the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of independent registered public accountants. 
Even if the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, could decide to terminate the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and to engage another firm if the Committee determines such action to be necessary or desirable. Conversely, if the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is not ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, could still decide to continue the engagement with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the 2019 audit if the Company determines such action to be necessary or desirable.

Compensation Program Overview 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of our executive officers and administering the cash incentive and equity-based plans in which our executive officers, directors and other employees participate. The goal of the Company's executive compensation program is to attract, motivate and retain talented individuals to help us attain our business goals and objectives. We are committed to achieving long-term, sustainable growth and increasing shareholder value. Our compensation program for our named executive officers is designed to be aligned with and to enhance these commitments, as well as to encourage strong financial performance on both an annual and long-term basis. 
The Compensation Committee uses total direct compensation as the primary measure of compensation for our named executive officers. The principal elements of total direct compensation for our CEO and our other named executive officers are: (i) annual base salary, (ii) annual performance incentives under the AIP, and (iii) long-term incentive compensation consisting of stock options and performance shares granted under the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended ("EIP"). 
Principal Elements of Total Direct Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary          +        Performance Incentive (cash award under AIP)          +          Long-term Incentive Compensation (performance shares and  stock options under EIP)            =        TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION   
 Base Salary          +        Performance Incentive (cash award under AIP)          +          Long-term Incentive Compensation (performance shares and  stock options under EIP)            =        TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION   
 Base Salary          +        Performance Incentive (cash award under AIP)          +          Long-term Incentive Compensation (performance shares and  stock options under EIP)            =        TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee places a significant focus on performance-based compensation, which is provided in the form of annual performance incentives under the AIP and stock options and performance shares under the EIP. Our focus on performance-based compensation rewards strong Company financial and operating performance and aligns the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders. 
For fiscal 2018, approximately 67% of the target total direct compensation for Messrs. Lawrence and Vasconi was attributable to performance-based compensation and approximately 60% of the target total direct compensation for Mr. Jordan was attributable to performance-based compensation. 
For our CEO and COO, the Compensation Committee places even more emphasis on the performance-based components of total direct compensation. Accordingly, excluding their Retention Equity Awards, as discussed below, approximately 82% of Mr. Allison's target total direct compensation after his promotion was attributable to performance-based compensation and approximately 78% of the target total direct compensation for Mr. Weiner after his promotion was attributable to performance-based compensation. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved special retention-based restricted stock awards under the EIP (each, a "Retention Equity Award") to each of our CEO and COO in connection with their promotions. Each Retention Equity Award will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, generally subject to the executive's continued employment through such date. The Compensation Committee understands that the Company operates in a highly

 competitive environment and recognizes that each of our CEO and COO are highly attractive candidates to other companies because of their skill and expertise. With input from Willis Towers Watson ("WTW"), the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate and in the best long-term interest of the Company and our shareholders to grant these Retention Equity Awards to each of these executives with a longer vesting period to incentivize their continued employment, and economic alignment, with the Company. 
Other aspects of the Company's executive compensation program are intended to further align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our shareholders and to promote good corporate governance. These include:

• Meaningful stock ownership guidelines for executives;

Compensation Philosophy and Process 
Compensation Committee Philosophy. The Compensation Committee determines the target total direct compensation levels, the components thereof and relative weightings of each component for our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee generally targets the 50th percentile of the applicable benchmark (i.e., peer group and broader quick service restaurant and hospitality industry surveys, as described below) when setting target total direct compensation levels for our CEO and other named executive officers, but also takes into account other factors as described below, including for fiscal 2018, special retention considerations. Executive-specific considerations, actual performance related to the applicable AIP and performance share measures and stock price performance can result in our named executive officers' actual total direct compensation being above or below the target in any given year. Our use of peer groups and other data in making compensation decisions is described below. 
Compensation Setting Process. In order to evaluate and maintain the effectiveness of the Company's current executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee annually reviews the reasonableness of executive compensation levels using independent professional compensation consultants, as well as public information about compensation levels at comparable companies within the Company's industry, and evaluates such levels in light of individual performance as well as the Company's growth and profitability. In 2018, the Compensation Committee used WTW as its independent professional compensation consultant. In December 2018, the Compensation Committee selected Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") to provide consulting services in relation to executive and director compensation decisions for the 2019 fiscal year. 
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews the nature and scope of each named executive officer's responsibilities, as well as his effectiveness in supporting the Company's long-term goals. The Compensation Committee attempts to set annual base salary, annual performance incentives, long-term incentive compensation and other compensation and benefits at levels that will attract, motivate, and retain superior executive talent in a highly competitive environment.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee conducted a review of the total direct compensation of our named executive officers using data provided by WTW. The Compensation Committee generally targeted the total direct compensation mix of our named executive officers, other than our CEO and COO, to be as follows: (i) 33% annual base salary, 33% annual performance incentive and 34% long-term incentive compensation for our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Information Officer, and (ii) 40% annual base salary, 20% annual performance incentive and 40% long-term incentive compensation for our Executive Vice President, International, each based on the grant date value of long-term incentive compensation and assuming target performance for annual performance incentives and long-term incentive compensation.

[END TABLE]
As noted previously, the Compensation Committee places more emphasis on the performance-based components of total direct compensation for our CEO and COO. Mr. Allison's target pay mix while serving as CEO in fiscal 2018, excluding his Retention Equity Award, was allocated as follows: 18% annual base salary, 36% annual performance incentive and 46% long-term incentive compensation, and Mr. Weiner's target pay mix while serving as COO in fiscal 2018, excluding his Retention Equity Award, was allocated as follows: 22% annual base salary, 33% annual performance incentive and 45% long-term incentive compensation, each based on the grant date value of long-term incentive compensation and assuming target performance for annual performance incentives and long-term incentive compensation.

*  Taking into account the Retention Equity Awards, the percentages for 2018 would be (i) approximately 9% Annual  Base Salary, 18% Annual Performance Incentive and 73% Long-term Incentive Compensation, with 41% being performance-based compensation, for our CEO, and (ii) approximately 11% Annual Base Salary, 17% Annual Performance Incentive and 72%  Long-term Incentive Compensation, with 39% being performance-based compensation, for our COO.

[END TABLE]
For any given year, the annual base salary, annual performance incentives and long-term incentive compensation actually earned by or paid to our named executive officers may differ from the percentage allocations described above due to actual performance relative to the applicable incentive plan performance measures and stock price performance. For fiscal 2018, the amount of annual performance incentives reported in the Summary Compensation Table as earned by our named executive officers is greater than the amount granted at target due to the achievement by the Company of applicable incentive plan performance measures at above-target levels. Additionally, for fiscal 2018, the actual long-term incentive compensation component of the total direct compensation for Mr. Allison and Mr. Weiner was greater than the targeted amounts for their respective positions due to the Retention Equity Awards. 
Consideration of Say-On-Pay Vote and Shareholder Feedback. In evaluating the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee also considered the results of the advisory vote on the say-on-pay proposal presented at the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. At the 2018 annual meeting, nearly 87% of shares voted were in support of the compensation provided to our named executive officers. In light of our shareholders' continued support and the success of the executive compensation program, we did not make any significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2018. The Compensation Committee concluded that the Company provides a competitive pay-for-performance package that effectively incentivizes and retains executives. 
In addition to considering the results of the 2018 say-on-pay vote as described above, the Company regularly engages in discussions with certain key shareholders to solicit their feedback regarding our executive compensation program. The Company and the Compensation Committee identified that the provision of a tax gross-up on personal usage of the corporate aircraft was an area of concern for certain shareholders and, therefore, eliminated this tax gross-up during fiscal 2018. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of outside advisors, experts and others to assist the Compensation Committee and also to discontinue such services. In accordance with this authority, the Compensation Committee engaged WTW as an independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on matters related to executive and director compensation in fiscal 2018 and in previous years. The Company assessed the independence of WTW pursuant to Item 407(e)(3)(iv) of Regulation S-K and concluded that no conflict of interest existed that would prevent WTW from independently advising the Compensation Committee. In 2018, WTW attended one Compensation Committee meeting in July 2018. Additionally, WTW prepared an executive compensation governance update that was provided to the Compensation Committee in advance of the July 2018 meeting, and an analysis of competitive executive pay practices that was provided to the Compensation Committee in advance of its December 2018 meeting. The Compensation Committee also used WTW data in evaluating and determining our named executive officers' target total direct compensation, and the components and relative weightings thereof, as described below. WTW continued to serve as the independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee through December 2018. The Compensation Committee selected Meridian as its independent compensation consultant for 2019. 
Benchmarking and Peer Group. The Compensation Committee evaluates executive compensation by measuring the target total direct compensation of our named executive officers against benchmarks consisting of the Company's peer group and of other comparable companies. It conducts an annual review of executive compensation by analyzing several peer group and market surveys, including peer group and market executive compensation studies prepared by WTW for the applicable time periods (the "WTW Studies") that reflect relevant general industry and quick service restaurant and hospitality industry compensation levels. The Compensation Committee generally uses a composite of these peer group

[END TABLE]
 and market surveys to determine market compensation levels, which it then uses when establishing named executive officers' target levels of total direct compensation and the components and relative weightings thereof. The Compensation Committee also takes into account individual compensation recommendations and individual performance, responsibilities, leadership and years of experience, as described below when making compensation decisions. 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the industry survey data in the WTW Studies and targeted the annual base salary for the former CEO to be at the market median. The Compensation Committee targeted the former CEO's total direct compensation for 2018 above market median, at approximately 117%, due to the financial performance and other characteristics of the relevant companies as compared with the Company, as described in further detail under "Compensation for Former Chief Executive Officer" below. The Compensation Committee also considered input from WTW when determining the compensation for Mr. Allison and Mr. Weiner that would become effective with their mid-year promotions, as described further under "Compensation for Chief Executive Officer" and "Compensation for Chief Operating Officer and President of the Americas." 
The Compensation Committee targets the annual base salary and total direct compensation for the other named executive officers, on average, to be within a competitive range around the market median for the upcoming year. For 2018, the base salaries of the named executive officers other than our CEO ranged from 91% to 112% of the median base salary from the WTW Studies and target total direct compensation ranged from 85% to 112% of such market median. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the composition of its peer group annually in July for use in executive compensation decisions for the following year. The following peer group was approved by the Compensation Committee in July 2017 to be used in reviewing and benchmarking for 2018 compensation. 
The following criteria were considered in determining the members of the Company's 2018 peer group: publicly-traded, retail or hospitality industry companies, revenues generally between 0.5 times and 2.5 times that of the Company, and a similar business model, complexity of business and recruiting pool for executives. 
In determining the 2018 peer group, the Compensation Committee removed Marriott International, Inc. due to its merger with Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, LLC making the combined entity's revenues too large for an appropriate comparison. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. was added to the peer group in its place. Yum! Brands, Inc. was also added to the 2018 peer group due to its spin-off from its Chinese operations resulting in post-separation revenues of approximately 2.5 times the Company's revenues, making it an appropriate comparator. 
Role of Executive Officers in Establishing Compensation. The Company's executive officers have a limited role in the executive compensation process. Our CEO, the Company's Chief People Officer and the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee annually review the performance of each named executive officer (other than our CEO) and the Company's other executive officers to formulate compensation recommendations for the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Chairman of the Board and the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee review the performance of our CEO to formulate recommendations relating to our CEO's compensation. The scope of these reviews is to evaluate performance for a given year and make compensation recommendations for that year and the subsequent year,

 including with respect to base salary adjustments and annual incentive awards under the AIP and EIP. The Chairperson of the Compensation Committee typically engages in discussions with WTW prior to presenting compensation recommendations to the full Compensation Committee for approval in December of each year. The Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to modify any recommended base salary adjustments or annual performance incentive or long-term incentive compensation awards to executives. The Compensation Committee ultimately makes all compensation decisions for our named executive officers, which are then ratified by our Board of Directors. 
Use of Tally Sheets. In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued its practice of annually reviewing comprehensive tally sheets for each of our named executive officers. These tally sheets are prepared by management and quantify the elements of each named executive officer's total direct compensation. The tally sheets contain annual cash compensation (base salary and annual performance incentives), other compensation, stock option exercises, equity award vesting events and annual equity award grants under the EIP, and also include the Accounting Standards Codification 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation ("ASC 718") fair market values for the equity award grants, potential severance payments, and equity award holdings with the total in-the-money value of such equity awards at the end of the preceding fiscal year. The Compensation Committee uses the tally sheets to get a full picture of the compensation accumulated by each executive to date, including accumulated equity value and potential severance. 
Equity Award Processes. Equity awards are generally granted at the regularly scheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee in February and July of each year. The specific date of these meetings is set by the Board of Directors, along with other Board and committee meetings, generally one to three years in advance. On occasion, in connection with new hires, promotions or certain corporate events, equity awards have been granted at other times throughout the year. The Compensation Committee does not have any plans, practices or policies of timing these equity award grants in coordination with the release of material non-public information and the Company does not have any plans, practices or policies of timing the release of material non-public information with the timing of equity awards. The exercise price of stock options is set at the closing price of the Company's common stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. 
Components of Total Direct Compensation 
Annual Base Salary. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the annual base salaries of our named executive officers and any adjustments thereto. In making decisions about adjustments to annual base salaries, the Compensation Committee considers various factors such as:

The Compensation Committee establishes the performance measures and targets and approves annual performance incentive payouts for the named executive officers based on the extent to which the pre-established performance targets associated with such incentives have been achieved. 
The Compensation Committee, Board of Directors and shareholders last approved the AIP in 2015. The AIP allows the Compensation Committee flexibility in establishing the participants, performance measures, performance periods and performance targets, including minimum and maximum annual payment thresholds. For fiscal 2018, greater than 90% of the applicable performance target was required to be achieved in order for AIP participants to be eligible to receive an annual performance incentive payout and the maximum annual payout under the AIP was the lesser of (i) 250% of an individual's annual performance incentive target, and (ii) $5,000,000 per participant, the maximum annual payment threshold. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee established the annual performance measure, list of participants and target incentive amounts under the AIP for senior executives of the Company for the 2018 fiscal year, including the increase in Messrs. Allison and Weiner's targets upon commencement of their new positions (as discussed above) and the addition of Mr. Jordan to the AIP upon his promotion to Executive Vice President, International. 
For annual performance incentives granted with respect to fiscal 2018, the performance measure, as applied to all of the named executive officers, was segment income as defined by the Company under Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting ("ASC 280"), with certain adjustments (referred to as "adjusted total segment income"), measured over the full 2018 fiscal year. The Compensation Committee believes that the use of adjusted total segment income is appropriate because it is a reliable barometer for the overall success of the Company and it is a primary measure used by management to internally evaluate operating performance, to determine future performance targets and for long-range planning for the Company. 
For fiscal 2018, a named executive officer was not entitled to an annual performance incentive payout under the AIP unless performance exceeded 90% of the performance target (the "performance threshold"). If performance exceeded the performance threshold, the executive officer would receive 1% of his annual performance incentive target for every incremental 0.1% in excess of the performance threshold achieved by the Company, up to the maximum annual payment amount described above. 
For illustrative purposes, assume a named executive officer had an annual base salary of $100,000 and was eligible for an annual performance incentive target of 100% of his annual base salary. Further assume that the Company had an annual performance target of $10,000,000. The Compensation Committee determined the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the annual performance result was $10,100,000, or 101.0% achievement of the annual performance target, the Company would  pay the named executive officer 110% of his annual performance incentive target, or $110,000. In other words, for 1% outperformance versus target, an additional 10% of target would be awarded.

• Conversely, assume the annual performance result was $9,500,000, or 95% achievement of the annual performance target. In  this situation, the Company would pay the named executive officer 50% (1% for every 0.1% over the performance threshold) of his annual performance incentive target, or $50,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Finally, assume the annual performance result was $9,000,000, or 90% achievement of the annual performance target. Given  the performance threshold, the Company would pay the named executive officer 0% of his annual performance incentive target, or $0.  
[END TABLE]
For the named executive officers, the annual performance target for fiscal 2018 was $640.0 million in adjusted total segment income. This annual performance target was set to be aggressive, yet realistic in order to sufficiently motivate executive performance. As shown below, the Compensation Committee has raised the annual performance target by 9.5% or more from the previous year's target in each of the last nine fiscal years. In 2018, the annual performance target was increased 13.5% from the 2017 annual performance target and 11% from the actual results in 2017. These significant increases require superior performance from the Company in a highly-competitive market to achieve the annual performance target.

The Compensation Committee sets the annual performance targets at levels that it believes are aggressive, but achievable. As shown in the chart above, in certain years, the AIP had zero payout or was paid out at less than target. The 11% increase in the 2018 performance target over our prior year's actual results was the largest annual increase set by the Compensation Committee and our performance incentive payout for 2018 was the lowest in nine years. Further, the AIP has never paid out at its maximum level in any year. 
The Company's current nine-year trend of higher than 100% achievement of annual performance targets has corresponded with the significant growth of the Domino's business over that time. This growth has been driven by many factors, including the reformulation and launch of our hand-tossed pizza in 2009, an increased focus on technology platforms, creative advertising that highlights our growing brand and product offerings, the introduction of a reimaged carryout-friendly store design and franchisee performance. 
The Company's U.S sales performance continues to be top of the QSR industry with a nine-year U.S. same store sales average increase of nearly 7.4%. Beginning in 2010, the Company's U.S. year-over-year same store sales increases were 9.9% in 2010, 3.5% in 2011, 3.1% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013, 7.5% in 2014, 12.0% in 2015, 10.5% in 2016, 7.7% in 2017 and 6.6% in 2018. The Company's international same store sales increased by 6.9% in 2010, 6.8% in 2011, 5.2% in 2012, 6.2% in 2013, 6.9% in 2014, 7.8% in 2015, 6.3% in 2016, 3.4% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. (For a description of how the Company calculates same store sales, a commonly-used statistical measure in the quick-service industry that the Company believes is important to understanding its financial performance, see our 2018 10-K).

 Additionally, the Company's global retail sales have increased by 11.4% in 2010, 11.0% in 2011, 6.5% in 2012, 8.2% in 2013, 11.1% in 2014, 8.4% in 2015, 12.5% in 2016, 12.7% in 2017 and 10.6% in 2018 and the Company's common stock price has increased 2,883% from January 1, 2010 through December 30, 2018. 
These business results have outpaced a very competitive industry and have resulted in above-target performance under the AIP during this same time period. Because the annual performance targets set by the Compensation Committee were based on the Company's performance as a whole, the likelihood of each named executive officer achieving his annual performance incentive targets was the same. 
The specific performance targets established by the Compensation Committee are based on the business plans of the Company and take into account a variety of factors including certain plans, programs, commodity pricing and discounts (including long-term supply contracts), product pricing and discounts, volume and sales predictions, marketing plans and expenses, U.S. and international store count projections, product initiatives, technological initiatives, macroeconomic conditions and other meaningful information. 
The amount of the annual performance incentive payouts for 2018 exceeded the target annual performance incentive payout because actual performance was 101.31% of the annual performance target. Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the AIP (as described above), based on this level of performance, 113.1% of the target incentive payout was earned by our named executive officers for fiscal 2018.

Long-term Incentive Compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that an equity component of executive compensation serves to align our named executive officers' interests with the interests of our shareholders and creates value for those shareholders. To that end, the Company maintains the EIP, a long-term equity-based incentive compensation program. 
Grants of awards to our CEO and other named executive officers are approved by the Compensation Committee and are ratified by our Board of Directors. In 2018, our Board of Directors ratified the following awards under the EIP to our named executive officers after considering the Company's equity grant guidelines and the WTW Studies:

Stock Options. As reflected in the table above, the Compensation Committee continued its use of stock options as a vehicle for long-term incentive compensation in 2018. Recipients of stock option grants do not receive a benefit from the stock options unless and until the market price of the Company's common stock increases above the exercise price and the recipient exercises such stock options. 
Stock options awarded under the EIP have a maximum term of ten years and vest ratably over four years, generally subject to continued employment. Vested options are exercisable for a limited period of time after termination of employment. All options awarded under the EIP are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. 
Performance Shares. In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued its use of performance shares as an additional vehicle for long-term incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that performance shares align with peer group equity compensation practices and are an important component of its diversified equity compensation strategy. Recipients of performance shares do not receive a benefit from the award unless the Company achieves the applicable performance goals associated with the award. The actual value of the shares that are earned, if any, will depend on our stock price at the time the performance shares vest. The Compensation Committee believes that participation in the Company's long-term incentive compensation program accomplishes the objective of linking each named executive officer's opportunity for financial gain to Company performance and increases in shareholder value, as reflected by the market price of the Company's common stock. 
Performance share awards are full value awards that consist of restricted shares of the Company's common stock that are subject to both time-based and performance-based vesting conditions. The awards vest over four years in four separate vesting tranches, generally subject to continued employment, and each vesting tranche is subject to a one-year performance-based vesting condition that is established annually by the Compensation Committee. Outstanding, unvested performance shares are also eligible to receive dividends. Dividends accrue on such unvested performance shares and are delivered if and when the performance shares to which they relate vest. For performance shares granted in 2018 (as well as prior years), the measurement of performance established by the Compensation Committee was segment income as defined by the Company under ASC 280, with certain adjustments (the same "adjusted total segment income" used by the Company for annual performance incentives, as described above). Adjusted total segment income was used as the performance measure for performance shares because it is the primary measure used by management to internally evaluate operating performance, to determine future performance targets and for long-range planning for the Company and the Compensation Committee believes it is the most reliable barometer for the overall success of the Company. 
For performance share grants awarded in fiscal 2015 and earlier, the performance shares vest only if the Company achieves at least 85% of the annual performance target (with no additional performance shares earned for performance above 85% of the annual performance target). Beginning with performance share grants awarded in fiscal 2016, performance shares vest only if 90% or more of the annual performance target is achieved (with no additional performance shares earned for performance above 90% of the annual performance target). If the achievement is less than 85% of the performance target for grants awarded in fiscal 2015 or earlier, or less than 90% for grants awarded in fiscal 2016 or later, each vesting tranche for that fiscal year is canceled and forfeited for no consideration. The performance share awards do not contain a provision for partial vesting. All unvested performance shares are canceled upon termination of employment, except as described below. The performance target with respect to the 2018 fiscal year was utilized for all performance shares previously granted with a 2018 vesting tranche; such performance target was achieved and all performance shares subject to a 2018 vesting tranche vested in full. 
Retention Equity Awards. In 2018, the Compensation Committee also granted our CEO and COO the Retention Equity Awards, as described above under "Compensation Program Overview." These restricted stock awards will vest as to 100% of the shares of restricted stock on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, generally subject to continued employment. Dividends accrue on unvested shares of restricted stock and are delivered if and when the shares vest.

Accelerated Vesting. In the event that an executive's employment is terminated (i) involuntarily by the Company without cause, or (ii) due to the executive's disability prior to the date any vesting tranche of the performance shares becomes vested based on continued employment but after the Compensation Committee has certified that the performance vesting conditions with respect to such vesting tranche have been satisfied, the performance shares subject to such vesting tranche will vest in full. All unvested stock options fully vest upon an executive's death. In the event of a qualified retirement, the time vesting condition applicable to all unvested performance shares will lapse and such performance shares will remain eligible to vest based on performance and all unvested stock options will vest in full. For this purpose, a qualified retirement means any termination of employment (other than for cause) after ten years of continuous service and attaining age 55. As of December 30, 2018, no currently-employed named executive officers had satisfied the qualified retirement requirements. Mr. Doyle became retirement-eligible on June 4, 2018 and his unvested performance shares and unvested stock options vested upon his termination of employment in accordance with the qualified retirement vesting schedule, as described further under "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Post-Employment Payments to Named Executive Officers" below. In the event that our CEO or COO's employment is terminated (i) involuntarily by the Company without cause, (ii) due to the executive's disability or death, or (iii) by the executive for good reason, in each case, on or after the second anniversary of the grant date of the Retention Equity Awards and before the third anniversary, 25% of the shares of restricted stock will vest and if such a termination occurs on or after the third anniversary of the grant date and prior to the fourth anniversary, 75% of the shares of restricted stock will vest. In the event of a covered transaction (generally defined in the EIP as a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity, a disposition of substantially all of the Company's common stock or assets, or a dissolution or liquidation of the Company) all unvested performance shares, stock options and shares of restricted stock will vest in full. 
Other Elements of Compensation 
Employee Stock Payroll Deduction Plan. The Company maintains the Employee Stock Payroll Deduction Plan (the "ESPDP"), adopted in July 2004, to provide employees, including our named executive officers, with an opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount from the market price. The ESPDP is a qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Shares of the Company's common stock purchased under the ESPDP have a one-year holding period requirement before employees can sell the shares. The Compensation Committee believes the ESPDP is an attractive benefit that assists the Company in retaining key employees, securing new qualified employees and providing incentives for employees to work towards achieving the Company's key objectives because it gives employees access to the Company's equity at a discounted price and provides additional ties to shareholder value creation. 
Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits. The Company does not maintain a defined benefit pension or retiree medical plan for the named executive officers. Mr. Doyle, however, was provided with certain post-employment health benefits, as described under "Potential Post-Employment Payments to Named Executive Officers." The Compensation Committee provided Mr. Doyle with this benefit after considering his successful tenure with the Company and the strong and record growth of the Company under his leadership. 
Deferred Compensation. The Company maintains the Domino's Pizza Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"), a nonqualified elective deferred compensation plan, under which our named executive officers, a select group of management or highly-compensated employees and our directors are permitted to defer their own compensation. Deferred amounts under the DCP are notionally invested in mutual funds or other investments available under the DCP. The Company does not provide an employer match for amounts deferred in the DCP or otherwise make employer contributions to the DCP. The DCP is described more fully under "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" below. 
Perquisites. The Company makes a limited number of perquisites available to our named executive officers. The Company covers expenses for each participating named executive officer for the completion of an annual comprehensive physical for the executive and his spouse. The Company also reimburses each named executive officer for his personal purchases of Domino's food items. Our CEO is also entitled to a certain number of hours of personal use of the Company's aircraft, as described below. Our Executive Vice President, International receives additional benefits in connection with his expatriate assignment in the Netherlands. Detailed information regarding the perquisites provided to the named executive officers is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement.

Other Benefits. The Company also maintains a benefits program comprised of retirement income and group insurance plans. The objective of the program is to provide our named executive officers and certain other full-time employees with reasonable and competitive levels of benefits for the four contingencies (retirement, death, disability and illness), which will interrupt the eligible employee's employment and/or income received as an active employee. The retirement program consists of two savings plans: (i) a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the DCP referenced above), and (ii) a tax-qualified 401(k) savings plan (the Domino's Pizza 401(k) Savings Plan). The 401(k) savings plan is open to all employees age 18 or older (lowered, as of January 1, 2018, from the requirement of age 21 or older) who have also worked at least 1,000 hours for the Company. The Company provides a match on employee 401(k) contributions equal to 100% on the first 3% of eligible compensation contributed by employees into their 401(k) accounts and 50% of the next 2% of eligible employee 401(k) contributions. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company match was enhanced to be 100% of the first 5% of eligible contributions to the 401(k) Savings Plan. 
The Company's group insurance program consists of life, disability and health insurance benefit plans that are offered to all full-time employees. Additionally, umbrella insurance premiums are paid by the Company for participating named executive officers, and the amounts paid are recorded as compensation (and included in the Summary Compensation Table) for such named executive officers. This umbrella insurance provides high limits of liability to protect the named executive officer against a catastrophic liability loss and stacks on top of the executive's homeowners, personal auto, watercraft, and any other underlying liability policies. Umbrella insurance covers bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury, which includes offenses such as libel, slander, false arrest, invasion of privacy, and others. 
Compensation for Former Chief Executive Officer 
In January 2018, Mr. Doyle announced his resignation from his position as CEO and director of the Company to be effective June 30, 2018. The Compensation Committee considered this announcement when making compensation decisions for the six months in 2018 in which Mr. Doyle would continue to serve in these roles. 
Mr. Doyle's annual base salary of $1,025,000, effective since March 1, 2016, was unchanged by the Compensation Committee for the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years. Mr. Doyle entered into an employment agreement in March 2015 that granted him an annual allotment of 45 hours of personal use of the Company's corporate aircraft during the term of the agreement at no charge to him to address bona fide business-oriented security concerns. For any personal use over the allotted 45 hours per year, the Company had a time-sharing agreement with Mr. Doyle that required him to reimburse the Company for such personal use of the Company's corporate aircraft pursuant to a statutory formula. The employment agreement also provided that Mr. Doyle would be eligible for an annual performance incentive that was targeted at 200% of his annual base salary, the actual amount of which was based on the Company's achievement of applicable performance targets under the AIP. 
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee elected to keep Mr. Doyle's annual base salary and target performance incentive at the same level as fiscal 2017. Given Mr. Doyle's resignation as of June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Doyle one-half of his target long-term incentive compensation, for a target value of 175% of his annual base salary, resulting in long-term incentive compensation in the form of an equity grant under the EIP consisting of: (i) a stock option award of 20,450 shares with a four-year graded vesting period, a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant, and (ii) a performance share award of 3,430 shares that vest equally over four years in separate tranches. The stock options and performance shares have the same terms and conditions as those described under "Long-term Incentive Compensation" above. Mr. Doyle became retirement-eligible prior to his resignation from the Company and, therefore, his stock options vested in full, and his performance shares will vest when and if the performance vesting conditions with respect to each vesting tranche have been satisfied. In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Doyle's performance incentive payout was prorated for fiscal 2018 based on his mid-year departure, as shown under "2018 Actual Payout" in the "Annual Performance Incentives" section above. In connection with his termination, the Compensation Committee also approved the health benefits described above.

Compensation for Chief Executive Officer 
In January 2018, the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Allison to succeed Mr. Doyle as CEO and to replace Mr. Doyle on the Board, effective July 1, 2018. 
Mr. Allison entered into a new employment agreement with the Company, effective July 1, 2018, under which he would receive (i) an annual base salary of $865,000, (ii) an annual incentive bonus target of 200% of his base salary, (iii) a 2018 annual equity award with a target value equal to 250% of his base salary, and (iv) a Retention Equity Award with a grant date value of $4,750,000, as described above under "Compensation Program Overview." In July 2018, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Allison received equity awards granted under the EIP consisting of (i) a stock option award of 17,940 shares with a four-year graded vesting period, a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, (ii) a performance share award of 3,050 shares that vest equally over a four-year period in separate tranches, and (iii) a Retention Equity Award of 16,910 shares of restricted stock that will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, generally subject to continued employment through such date. 
Mr. Allison's employment agreement also grants him an annual allotment of 45 hours of personal use of the Company's corporate aircraft at no charge to him during the term of the agreement. Mr. Allison entered into a time-sharing agreement with the Company requiring him to reimburse the Company for personal use over his allotted hours based upon a statutory formula. Mr. Allison was not provided with a tax gross-up with respect to his personal use of the Company's corporate aircraft. 
The Compensation Committee determined the terms of Mr. Allison's compensation as CEO with input from WTW and after reviewing his current compensation arrangements and the compensation of chief executive officers at peer group companies with similar backgrounds and experience. The Company's Board of Directors approved his new compensation terms and employment agreement as well as his equity awards at the time of grant. 
Mr. Allison's annual base salary as CEO is at approximately 85% of the market median according to the WTW Studies. Mr. Allison's 2018 annual performance incentive target is above the market median and his long-term incentive compensation, excluding his Retention Equity Award, is below the market median, resulting in his total direct compensation being above the market median. The Compensation Committee believes that Mr. Allison's compensation is appropriate in relation to his skills, experience (including his serving in an executive capacity at the Company for more than seven years), past performance, Company performance and market data. Further, the Compensation Committee believes Mr. Allison's compensation package effectively links shareholder and financial performance to his total direct compensation through the use of long-term incentive compensation awards and cash compensation that is primarily based on Company performance and that it further encourages retention through the grant of his Retention Equity Award. 
Compensation for Chief Operating Officer and President of the Americas 
In connection with his appointment as Chief Operating Officer and President of the Americas, Mr. Weiner entered into a new employment agreement with the Company, effective July 1, 2018, under which he would receive (i) a base salary of $725,000, (ii) an annual incentive bonus target of 150% of his base salary, (iii) a 2018 annual equity award with a target value equal to 200% of his base salary, and (iv) a Retention Equity Award with a grant date value of $3,275,000, as described above under "Compensation Program Overview." In July 2018, in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Weiner received equity awards granted under the EIP consisting of (i) a stock option award of 10,030 shares with a four-year graded vesting period, a ten-year term and an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, (ii) a performance share award of 2,560 shares that vest equally over a four-year period in separate tranches, and (iii) a Retention Equity Award of 11,660 shares of restricted stock that will vest 100% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, generally subject to continued employment through such date. 
The Compensation Committee determined the terms of Mr. Weiner's compensation in his new position with input from WTW. The Company's Board of Directors approved his new compensation terms and employment agreement as well as his equity awards at the time of grant.

Employment Agreements 
Each of our named executive officers is party to a written agreement that governs their employment with the Company and includes both severance provisions as well as restrictive covenants that apply for two years following termination of employment. The provisions of the employment agreements relating to termination of employment and severance are described in more detail under "Potential Post-Employment Payments to Named Executive Officers." We believe entering into non-competition and non-solicitation arrangements with our named executive officers is important to protect the Company following the cessation of their employment and we also believe that severance provisions help attract and retain top-performing executive officers. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee reviews the Company's stock ownership guidelines annually. In July 2015, the Compensation Committee amended the guidelines to require stock ownership after five years of employment or service with the Company at the individual's current executive level equal to five times base salary for our CEO, four times base salary for President-level executives, and three times base salary for the other named executive officers. These stock ownership guidelines are designed to align management's and shareholders' interests and to encourage loyalty and long-term focus of executives. All of our named executive officers and directors who have completed their respective accumulation period under the guidelines are in compliance with such guidelines. 
Clawback Policy 
The Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy which provides that in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements under the U.S. federal securities laws, the Compensation Committee has the right to use reasonable efforts to recover from any of our current or former executive officers who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act and who received incentive-based compensation (including annual cash incentives, performance-based compensation and time-based equity and equity-based awards) during the three-year period preceding the announcement by the Company of its financial statement restatement. Such recovery will be equal to the amount of excess compensation awarded or paid to such executive officer as a result of the misstatement. This policy applies to cash bonus opportunities and performance-based compensation awards made on or after December 29, 2014. This clawback policy is intended to be interpreted in a manner consistent with any applicable rules or regulations adopted by the SEC or the NYSE as contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act and any other applicable law and shall otherwise be interpreted by the Compensation Committee. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) generally limits the tax deductibility of annual compensation paid by a publicly-held company to $1,000,000 per employee per year for certain executive officers (and beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers). Historically, this limitation excepted performance-based compensation paid under a plan that was approved by the shareholders of a company that also met certain other technical requirements. However, this performance-based compensation exception was repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, compensation paid to certain current or former executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 per year will generally not be deductible unless, if eligible, it qualifies as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation pursuant to transition relief applicable to certain legally binding contracts that were in effect as of November 2, 2017, and which have not been modified in any material respect on or after such date. The Compensation Committee views the tax deductibility of executive compensation as one factor to be considered in the context of an overall compensation philosophy, but not the only factor. The Company has paid and will continue to pay executive compensation that is not fully deductible under applicable tax law. 
Risk Assessment Disclosure 
In February of each year, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with its compensation consultant and senior human resource executives of the Company, reviews the risk assessment for risks associated with the Company's compensation practices and policies for employees. Based upon the assessment performed for the 2018 fiscal year, and most recently for the 2019 fiscal year, the Committee believes that, through the counterbalance of risk-taking incentives and risk-mitigating features guided by relevant market practices and Company goals, the Company's compensation practices and policies do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on financial results of the Company.

(1)  The dollar amounts listed do not necessarily reflect the dollar amounts of compensation actually realized or that may  be realized by our executive officers. The amounts listed reflect the fair value of awards of performance shares granted pursuant to our EIP, determined in accordance with ASC 718 based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance  conditions (which is assumed that the performance conditions were satisfied in full) and disregarding the effect of forfeitures. The stock awards for 2018 represent the first two tranches of the performance share awards granted in 2018, the third  tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2017 and the fourth tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2016 (or the number of shares in each award that have been valued for accounting purposes as of December 30, 2018, the end  of the 2018 fiscal year). The fourth tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2017 and the third tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2018 will be valued when the performance condition is established in December 2019, and the  fourth tranche of the performance share awards awarded in 2018 will be valued when the performance condition is established in December 2020. The stock awards for 2017 represent the first two tranches of the performance share awards granted in 2017,  the third tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2016, and the fourth tranche of the performance share awards in 2015 (or the number of shares in each award that have been valued for accounting purposes as of December 31, 2017, the  end of the 2017 fiscal year). The stock awards for 2016 represent the first two tranches of the performance share awards granted in 2016, the third tranche of the performance share awards granted in 2015, and the fourth tranche of the performance  share awards granted in 2014 (or the number of shares in each award that were valued for accounting purposes as of January 1, 2017, the end of 2016 fiscal year). The assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in footnote  9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 included in the Company's 2018 10-K. The amounts for Messrs.

The incremental cost is based on the variable operating costs to the Company for operating the airplane, including, but not limited to fuel costs, parking, landing fees, travel fees,  catering and other miscellaneous direct costs. The total annual variable costs are divided by the annual number of flight hours flown by the airplane to calculate an average variable cost per flight hour. This average variable flight cost per flight  hour is then multiplied by the flight hours of personal use to calculate the incremental cost for the executive. For tax purposes, income is imputed to the executive for personal travel based on a multiple of the Standard Industry Fare Level  ("SIFL") rates.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
A select group of management or highly compensated employees as defined by the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974, as amended, as well as the Company's directors, are eligible to participate in the Domino's Pizza Deferred Compensation Plan, or the DCP. The purpose of the DCP is to provide supplemental retirement income and to permit eligible employees to defer receipt of compensation pursuant to the terms of the plan. 
Participants are able to defer a portion of eligible compensation (including annual base salary and the annual performance incentive). Participants elect a specific date or event (such as termination of employment) for payment of deferred compensation and the form of the payment, either lump sum or installments. Participants are able to notionally invest their deferrals in mutual funds selected by them from a lineup of options. The options available under the DCP for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 were as follows: 
Boston Trust Small Cap Fund 
Credit Suisse Commodity Return Strategy Fund 
Dreyfus Mid Cap Index Fund

There are no named executive officers who currently participate in or have balances under the Domino's Pizza Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Potential Post-Employment Payments to Named Executive Officers 
Each named executive officer, other than Mr. Doyle, is currently a party to an employment agreement providing for payments and benefits in connection with certain terminations of the named executive officer's employment. The benefits that Mr. Doyle received in connection with his resignation from the Company are described below. 
Under Mr. Allison's and Mr. Weiner's employment agreements effective July 1, 2018, upon involuntary termination of employment by the Company without cause (as defined in the agreement), or if either Mr. Allison or Mr. Weiner terminates his employment voluntarily for good reason (generally defined to include material diminution of his responsibilities, duties or authority, a relocation of his office by more than 50 miles, or the failure of the Company to pay his base salary and benefits) prior to the end of the term of the agreement, he would receive an amount equal to two times his then-annual base salary. Such amount would be paid in equal installments, subject to a six-month delay to the extent required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
Under the employment agreements of Messrs. Lawrence, Jordan and Vasconi, upon an involuntary termination of employment by the Company without cause (as defined in the applicable agreement), or if the named executive officer terminates his employment voluntarily for good reason (generally defined as described above), the named executive officer would receive an amount equal to one-times his then-annual base salary. Such amount would be paid as follows: a payment equal to six times the named executive officer's base monthly salary made six months after termination of employment and monthly payments equal to the executive's base monthly salary for the next six months.

In the event of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason, each named executive officer would also be entitled to receive any earned but unpaid annual performance incentive for the fiscal year preceding his termination of employment and a prorated annual performance incentive under the AIP for the year of such termination. In addition, during the severance period, each named executive officer would be entitled to Company-paid medical insurance coverage premiums. 
In the event of a termination of employment by reason of a named executive officer's death or disability, or voluntarily by the named executive officer due to retirement, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive any earned but unpaid annual performance incentive for the fiscal year preceding his termination of employment and a prorated annual performance incentive under the AIP for the year of such termination. Mr. Allison would be, entitled to these benefits on a voluntary termination of employment without good reason. 
Following a termination of employment for any reason, equity awards and other benefits are governed by the terms of those programs. 
Each of the employment agreements for the named executive officers contains a two-year non-competition and non-solicitation provision. 
In connection with his resignation from the Company effective June 30, 2018, the Company agreed to provide Mr. Doyle and his spouse with continued medical coverage for the remainder of their respective lives. For financial statement accounting purposes, the Company has valued this benefit at $1,054,000, although the actual amounts paid to Mr. Doyle and his spouse may differ. Mr. Doyle was also entitled to the qualified retirement benefits with respect to his unvested performance shares and unvested stock options described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-term Incentive Compensation" above. The value of the option acceleration was $14,841,900, calculated as the difference between the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of Mr. Doyle's resignation and the exercise price of his unvested options multiplied by the number of unvested options then held by Mr. Doyle. The value that Mr. Doyle will receive with respect to the satisfaction of the time-based vesting conditions applicable to his performance shares could not be quantified as of the date of his resignation as the awards will only become earned, if at all, upon the Company's achievement of the performance conditions described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-term Incentive Compensation" above. As of the date of his employment termination, Mr. Doyle held 17,849 performance shares for which the time-based vesting condition was satisfied. Mr. Doyle was not entitled to receive any other benefits in connection with his resignation.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC requires annual disclosure of the ratio of the median annual total compensation of all of our employees to the annual total compensation of our CEO. We had two individuals serving (non-concurrently) as CEO during fiscal 2018, and we selected Mr. Allison for purposes of providing the required pay ratio disclosure because he was the individual serving as CEO as of the date when we selected our median employee, as described below. 
To identify the median employee, we used 2018 total cash compensation, which includes annual base salaries or base wages plus annual bonuses, if any, as reported on each employee's W-2, Box 1, as our consistently applied compensation measure. We used total cash compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees (less than 1.5% of our employees received annual equity awards). We then measured total cash compensation for all individuals who were employed by us on December 1, 2018, excluding (i) our CEO and (ii) all team members located in countries outside of the United States, pursuant to the de minimis exemption under the pay ratio rules. A total of 234 team members were so excluded and are detailed by each non-U.S. jurisdiction below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Brazil:              2     Dubai:             11    Mexico:                   2 
 Canada:      190     Hong Kong:      9    Netherlands:         14 
 China:             2     India:                3    United Kingdom:     1 
[END TABLE]
Except as described above, we included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation. We did, however, annualize the compensation used for employees who were not employed by us for all of 2018 by taking an employee's compensation for the number of bi-weekly pay periods for which they were employed and annualizing such amount for the full year of 26 pay periods. As of December 1, 2018, we had 13,940 U.S.-based full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees. As of this same date, including our team members located in countries outside the United States, we had 14,174 full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees. 
Based on total cash compensation, our median employee was identified as a part-time delivery driver who worked an average of 28 hours per week and was employed by the Company for 15 of 26 pay periods. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 earlier in this Proxy Statement. 
Mr. Allison's annual total compensation for the 2018 fiscal year was $9,102,416, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 above. Our median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was $19,077. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Allison's annual total compensation was approximately 477 times that of our median employee. 
If we adjusted Mr. Allison's annual base salary as if he served as our CEO for a full year (to $865,000), and further adjusted his AIP payout value to reflect a payout as if he were CEO for the full year (to $1,956,630), his adjusted annual total compensation for 2018, with no additional changes to the other amounts included in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 above, would be $9,709,192. After giving effect to these adjustments, Mr. Allison's adjusted annual total compensation for 2018 would be approximately 509 times that of our median employee. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.

   Proposal Three: Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation      
   Proposal Three: Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation      
[END TABLE]
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company provided shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in our 2018 Proxy Statement. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as "say-on-pay." At our 2018 annual meeting, our shareholders approved the proposal with 86.6% of the shares voted in favor of the say-on-pay proposal. 
At the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company also held an advisory vote on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. Our shareholders voted in favor of an annual say-on-pay vote and the Company has elected to follow such recommendation. Accordingly, this year we are again asking our shareholders to vote FOR the approval of the compensation we pay to our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. In accordance with Rule 14a-21(b) of the Exchange Act, shareholders will be asked to vote again on how frequently we should hold future say-on-pay votes at the Company's 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. 
The objectives, philosophy and programs, along with the compensation paid to our named executive officers and the rationale for such compensation, are set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related tables and narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement. 
The Board of Directors, as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, is asking shareholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and any related material contained in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED." 
As we described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, our executive compensation program embodies a pay-for-performance philosophy that supports the Company's business strategy and aligns the interests of our executives with our shareholders. In approving the 2018 compensation decisions for our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considered the financial performance of the Company in 2017. In fiscal 2017, the Company's financial results significantly exceeded its 2017 business plan and goals. The Company's named executive officers contributed greatly to these achievements and, therefore, the compensation of our named executive officers was increased. 
In addition, the Company has reviewed its compensation programs and engaged in discussions with our key shareholders to solicit feedback regarding our executive compensation programs. As a result of these conversations, the Company eliminated tax gross-ups on personal usage of the corporate aircraft by the Company's executives in 2018. 
For these reasons, the Board is asking shareholders to again support this say-on-pay proposal. Although the vote we are asking you to cast is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the views of our shareholders and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote when determining future compensation arrangements for our named executive officers.

The Company's legal staff is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of processes and controls to obtain information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related person transactions and for then determining, based on the facts and circumstances, whether a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction.

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing potential related person transactions and, in connection with its review, will consider the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction, the material terms of the transaction, the relative importance of the transaction to the related person, the relative importance of the transaction to the Company, whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or officer of the Company and any other matters deemed important, following which it may approve or ratify the transaction in its discretion. As required under SEC rules, transactions with any related person that are determined to be directly or indirectly material are disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

"Householding" of Proxy Materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers
