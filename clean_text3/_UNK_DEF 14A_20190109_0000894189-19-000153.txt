PROXY STATEMENT
January 9, 2019
FOR THE JOINT ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 22, 2019
INTRODUCTION
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Boards of Trustees (the "Board") of DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund ("DBL") and DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund ("DSL") (each, a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") of proxies to be voted by the respective shareholders at the Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Funds, including any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof (the "Meeting").  The Meeting will be held in the Hershey Room at Omni Los Angeles Hotel, 251 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, CA  90012, on Friday, February 22, 2019, at 12:00 p.m., Pacific Time.  Each Board functions independently and has chosen to hold a joint meeting for efficiency.
The Notice of a Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Notice"), this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy cards are first being sent to Shareholders on or about January 9, 2019.
Holders of common shares ("Common Shares") of each Fund (the "Shareholders") will vote on whether to re-elect such Fund's nominee for Trustee of the Fund (with respect to DBL, the "DBL Proposal" and, with respect to DSL, the "DSL Proposal" and, collectively, the "Proposals") and on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting.  The class of Common Shares is the only class of shares of each Fund currently outstanding.  The outcome of voting by the Shareholders of one Fund does not affect the outcome for the other Fund.
The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of each Fund has fixed the close of business on December 21, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of Shareholders of the Fund entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting.  The Shareholders of each Fund on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote per Common Share on each matter to which they are entitled to vote and that is to be voted on by Shareholders of the Fund, and a fractional vote with respect to fractional shares, with no cumulative voting rights in the election of Trustees. The following table sets forth the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding of each Fund at the close of business on the Record Date:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Outstanding  Common Shares
  Outstanding  Common Shares
 DBL   14,927,622.62  
 DSL   101,392,671.99  
[END TABLE]
You may vote by mail by returning a properly executed proxy card, by Internet by going to the website listed on the proxy card, by telephone using the toll-free number listed on the proxy card, or in person by attending the Meeting. Shares represented by duly executed and timely delivered proxies will be voted as instructed on the proxy. If you execute and mail the enclosed proxy and no choice is indicated for the election of the nominee listed in this Proxy Statement, your proxy will be voted in favor of the election of the nominee.  At any time before it has been voted, your proxy may be revoked in one of the following ways: (i) by delivering a signed, written letter of revocation prior to the Meeting to the Secretary of the relevant Fund at 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, California 90071, (ii) by properly executing and timely submitting a later-dated proxy vote, or (iii) by attending the Meeting and voting in person. Please call (877) DLine11 (877-354-6311) for information on how to obtain directions to be able to attend the Meeting and vote in person. If any proposal, other than the Proposals set forth herein, properly comes before the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote for or against such proposals in their sole discretion. The principal executive office of the Funds is located at 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, California 90071. DoubleLine Capital LP ("DoubleLine") serves as the investment manager of each Fund. Additional information regarding DoubleLine may be found under "Additional Information—Investment Manager" below.
The solicitation will be primarily by mail, and the cost of soliciting proxies for each Fund will be borne by such Fund. Certain officers of the Funds and certain officers and employees of DoubleLine or its affiliates (none of whom will receive additional compensation therefor) may solicit proxies by telephone, mail, e-mail and personal interviews.  In addition, Broadridge Financial Solutions has been engaged to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $94,980 although the actual costs of the solicitation may be higher.  Each Fund will also reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the Fund's Common Shares.  Shared costs borne by the Funds are generally allocated between the Funds based on the number of shareholder accounts in respect of each Fund.  Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation will be borne by the Fund incurring such expenses.  Costs borne directly by a Fund are borne indirectly by the Fund's Shareholders.
Unless a Fund receives contrary instructions, only one copy of this Proxy Statement will be mailed to a given address where two or more Shareholders share that address.  Additional copies of the Proxy Statement will be delivered promptly upon request.  Requests may be sent to the Secretary of the Funds at 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, California 90071, or may be made by calling (877) DLine11 (877-354-6311) on any business day.
PROPOSALS: RE-ELECTION OF TRUSTEE
In accordance with each Fund's Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration"), the Trustees have been divided into the following three classes (each, a "Class"): Class I, Class II and Class III.  Under this classified Board structure, generally only those Trustees in a single Class may be replaced in any one year.  It would require two to three years to change a majority of a Fund's Board, depending on the composition of the Classes up for election in the first two years. This structure, which may be regarded as an "anti-takeover" provision, may make it more difficult for a Fund's Shareholders to change the majority of Trustees of the Fund and, thus, promotes the continuity of management.
DBL. With respect to DBL, the term of office of the Class I Trustee will expire at the Meeting after his successor is elected and qualified.  Joseph J. Ciprari is currently the Class I Trustee of the Fund.  The Fund's Nominating Committee recommended to the Board that Mr. Ciprari be nominated for re-election by the Shareholders as a Class I Trustee and the Board approved such nomination.  If re-elected at the Meeting, Mr. Ciprari will serve a term expected to expire no earlier than the Fund's annual meeting held in 2022.  If Mr. Ciprari is not re-elected at the Meeting, he will continue to serve as a Trustee until his successor is elected and qualified, or until he dies, resigns or is removed from office.
DSL. With respect to DSL, the term of office of the Class III Trustee will expire at the Meeting after his successor is elected and qualified.  Joseph J. Ciprari is currently the Class III Trustee of the Fund.  The Fund's Nominating Committee recommended to the Board that Mr. Ciprari be nominated for re-election by the Shareholders as a Class III Trustee and the Board approved such nomination. If re-elected at the Meeting, Mr. Ciprari will serve a term expected to expire no earlier than the Fund's annual meeting held in 2022.  If Mr. Ciprari is not re-elected at the Meeting, he will continue to serve as a Trustee until his successor is elected and qualified, or until he dies, resigns or is removed from office. All members of the Board are and will remain (in the case of Mr. Ciprari, if re-elected) "Continuing Trustees," as such term is defined in the Declaration, having served as Trustees since the commencement of each Fund's operations.
Unless authority is withheld, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote each proxy for the re-election of Mr. Ciprari. Mr. Ciprari has indicated he will serve if elected, but if he should be unwilling or unable to serve, the proxy holders may vote each proxy in favor of electing such substitute nominee as the Board may designate.
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board of each Fund consists of four Trustees, three of whom are not considered to be "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) of the Funds (the "Independent Trustees"). The Board is responsible for overseeing the management and operations of each Fund, including general supervision of the duties performed by DoubleLine and other service providers to the Fund. DoubleLine and each Fund's administrator are responsible for the day-to-day management and administration of the Fund.
The Chairman of each Fund's Board, Mr. Ronald R. Redell, also serves as President of the Funds and DoubleLine Funds Trust and as an executive of DoubleLine Group LP.  Mr. Redell is an "interested person" of the Funds.
Mr. Raymond B. Woolson serves as the lead Independent Trustee.  A portion of each regular meeting of the Board is devoted to an executive session of the Independent Trustees at which no members of management or the Funds' administrator are present. At those meetings, the Independent Trustees consider a variety of matters that are required by law to be considered by the Independent Trustees, as well as matters that are scheduled to come before the full Board of Trustees, including fund governance, fund management, and leadership issues, and are advised by independent legal counsel.  Mr. Woolson serves as Chair for those meetings.
The Board believes that each Trustee's and nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees lead to the conclusion that the Board possesses the requisite skills and attributes to carry out its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Funds. The Board believes that the Trustees' and nominees' ability to review, critically evaluate, question, and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with DoubleLine, other service providers, counsel and independent auditors, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of its duties, support this conclusion. The Board also has considered the following experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills, among others, of its members, as applicable, in reaching its conclusion: (i) such person's business and professional experience and accomplishments, including prior experience in the financial services and investment management fields or on other boards; (ii) such person's ability to work effectively with the other members of the Board; (iii) how the individual's skills, experiences, and attributes would contribute to an appropriate mix of relevant skills and experience on the Board; (iv) such person's character and integrity; (v) such person's willingness to serve and willingness and ability to commit the time necessary to perform the duties of a Trustee; and (vi) as to each Trustee or nominee other than Mr. Redell, his status as an Independent Trustee.  In addition, the following specific experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills were considered in respect of the listed Trustee or nominee: Mr. Ciprari, significant experience serving in the investment banking industry, as a senior executive at an investment bank; Mr. Salter, significant experience and familiarity with securities markets and financial matters generally; Mr. Woolson, significant financial consulting, fund accounting, and fund administration experience; and Mr. Redell, significant experience and service in the investment management industry and as a senior executive at an investment advisory firm.  With respect to his nomination for re-election, Mr. Ciprari's prior service as a Trustee of the Funds was also considered. References to the experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of Trustees or the nominee are pursuant to requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), do not constitute holding out of the Board or any Trustee or nominee as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.
The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given the business and nature of each Fund, including (i) Mr. Redell's role as an executive of DoubleLine Capital LP and DoubleLine Group LP; (ii) the extent to which the Independent Trustees meet as needed, together with their independent legal counsel, in the absence of members of management and members of the Board who are "interested persons" of each Fund; and (iii) the leadership role of the lead Independent Trustee.  The Board expects to review its structure on an annual basis. In its oversight role, the Board and/or its Committees receive and review reports from each Fund's officers, including, but not limited to, the President, Chief Compliance Officer and Treasurer, DoubleLine portfolio management personnel and other senior personnel of DoubleLine, the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, and the Funds' third-party service providers with respect to a variety of matters, including matters that relate to the operations of the Funds, including related risks.
The function of the Board with respect to risk management is one of periodic oversight and not active involvement in, or coordination of, day-to-day risk management activities for the Funds. DoubleLine's personnel seek to identify and address risks, i.e., events or circumstances that could have material adverse effects on the business, operations, shareholder services, investment performance or reputation of the Funds.  Under the general oversight of the Board or the applicable Committee of the Board, the Funds, DoubleLine, and other service providers to the Funds employ a variety of processes, procedures, and controls to identify such possible events or circumstances, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur.  The Board recognizes, however, that not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve each Fund's goals, and that the processes, procedures, and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Trustees that may relate to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. There is no assurance that the Board of Trustees' operations or leadership structure will identify, prevent, or mitigate risks in actual practice.
The name, year of birth and principal occupations for the past five years of the Trustees and officers of the Funds are listed below, along with the number of portfolios in the fund complex(1) overseen and the other directorships held by each Trustee. The business address for each Trustee is c/o DoubleLine, 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, CA 90071.

The Trusts have adopted a deferred compensation plan that allows the Independent Trustees to defer payment of compensation earned to a future period.

Trustees and officers who are employed by DoubleLine or an affiliated company thereof do not receive any compensation or expense reimbursement from the Funds.
Board Committees and Meetings
Audit Committee
The Board of each Fund has established an Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  Mr. Woolson serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee's other members are Messrs. Ciprari and Salter.  The Audit Committee makes recommendations to the Board concerning the selection of the independent auditors and reviews with the auditors the results of the annual audit, including the scope of auditing procedures, the adequacy of internal controls and compliance by the Funds with the accounting and financial reporting requirements of the 1940 Act.
Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," as independence for audit committee members is defined in the currently applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), on which the Common Shares of the Funds are listed (the "NYSE Listing Standards").
Based on the findings of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee has determined that Mr. Woolson is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in the rules promulgated by the SEC, and as required by NYSE Listing Standards.
The Board has adopted a written charter for its Audit Committee.  A copy of the written charter for the Funds is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A. A report of the Audit Committee of DBL and DSL, dated November 15, 2018, is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit B.
Qualifications, Evaluation and Identification of Trustee/Nominees
Potential nominees may be considered in light of any factor the Nominating Committee members deem relevant, including their professional experience, education, skill, collegiality and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to Board diversity.

The Nominating Committee will review and consider nominees recommended by Shareholders to serve as Trustees, provided that the recommending Shareholder follows the "Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates," which are set forth as Appendix A to the Funds' Nominating Committee Charter (the "Procedures"), a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit C. Among other requirements, these procedures provide that the recommending Shareholder must submit any such recommendation (a "Shareholder Recommendation") in writing to the relevant Fund, to the attention of the Fund's Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Fund. The Shareholder Recommendation must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Fund not less than sixty (60) calendar days nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at which the nominee candidate would be considered for election.  Any recommendation must include, among other things, certain biographical and other information regarding the candidate and the recommending Shareholder, and must include a written and signed consent of the candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. The foregoing description of the requirements is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the Procedures.  Please refer to Appendix A to the Nominating Committee Charter for the Funds. The Nominating Committee has full discretion to reject nominees recommended by Shareholders, and there is no assurance that any such person properly recommended and considered by the Committee will be nominated for election to the Board of the Funds.  See "Additional Information—Shareholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting" for information regarding submitting shareholder proposals for consideration at the Funds' 2020 annual shareholder meeting.
Qualified Legal Compliance Committee
The Board has a Qualified Legal Compliance Committee ("QLCC"), consisting of Messrs. Ciprari, Salter, and Woolson. The QLCC receives, reviews and takes appropriate action with respect to any report made or referred to the QLCC by an attorney of evidence of a material violation of applicable U.S. federal or state securities law, material breach of a fiduciary duty under U.S. federal or state law or a similar material violation by the Funds or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of a Fund.
Meetings

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board of Trustees for DSL held four regular meetings and nine special meetings. The Audit Committee met in separate session four times.  The Nominating Committee met once and the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee did not meet.
Each Trustee attended in person or via teleconference at least 75% of the regular meetings of the Board and meetings of the committees on which such Trustee served for each Fund that were held during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The Funds do not require Trustees to attend the Joint Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but the Trustees may attend the Meeting if they choose to do so.
Shareholder Communications with the Board of Trustees
Shareholders of the Funds may send communications to the Board by mailing written communications to the attention of the Board of Trustees, [Name of Fund], c/o Cris Santa Ana, Secretary, DoubleLine, 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, California 90071.  Shareholder communications must (i) be in writing and be signed by the Shareholder and (ii) identify the number of Common Shares held by the Shareholder. DoubleLine is responsible for collecting, reviewing and organizing all properly submitted shareholder communications. Except as discussed below, DoubleLine shall either (i) provide a copy of each properly submitted shareholder communication to the Board at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting or (ii) if DoubleLine determines that the communication requires more immediate attention, forward the communication to the Trustees promptly after receipt. DoubleLine may, in good faith, determine that a shareholder communication should not be provided to the Board because it does not reasonably relate to a Fund or its operations, management, activities, policies, service providers, Board, officers, shareholders or other matters relating to an investment in the Fund or is otherwise ministerial in nature (such as a request for Fund literature, share data or financial information). These procedures shall not apply to (i) any communication from an officer or a Trustee of a Fund, (ii) any communication from an employee or agent of a Fund, unless such communication is made solely in such employee's or agent's capacity as a shareholder, or (iii) any shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, or any communication made in connection with such a proposal. The Trustees are not required to attend a Fund's annual shareholder meetings or to otherwise make themselves available to shareholders for communications, other than by the aforementioned procedures. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require each Fund's officers and Trustees, officers and directors of the investment adviser, affiliated persons of the investment adviser, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's shares, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE and to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on a review of the reports filed with the SEC and upon representations that no additional Section 16(a) forms were required to be filed, the Funds believe that during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to each Fund's officers, Trustees and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with, except for the following inadvertent late filings: a Form 3 filing was made with respect to each of DBL and DSL between March 9, 2018 and September 26, 2018 by or on behalf of each of Leticia A. Acosta, Mark W. Christensen, Brady Femling, Winnie Han, Ignacio E. Sosa,  Adam D. Rossetti and Neal L. Zalvan.
Required Vote  
The re-election of Mr. Ciprari to the Board of DBL will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of the Shareholders (voting as a single class) of DBL cast at the Meeting, in person or by proxy.
The re-election of Mr. Ciprari to the Board of DSL will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of the Shareholders (voting as a single class) of DSL cast at the Meeting, in person or by proxy.

Investment Manager
DoubleLine was organized in 2009 as a Delaware limited liability company, and was converted into a Delaware limited partnership on December 23, 2009. The general partner of DoubleLine is DoubleLine Capital GP LLC, an entity that is wholly owned by Jeffrey E. Gundlach. As a result, Mr. Gundlach may be deemed to control DoubleLine.  DoubleLine employs certain personnel and other resources through contractual arrangements with DoubleLine Group LP.  All investment personnel of DoubleLine are employees of DoubleLine Group LP and provide services to DoubleLine pursuant to contractual arrangements.  The general partner of DoubleLine Group LP is DoubleLine Capital GP LLC, an entity that is wholly owned by Jeffrey E. Gundlach. As a result, Mr. Gundlach may be deemed to control DoubleLine Group LP.  Under separate Investment Management Agreements between DoubleLine and each Fund, the relevant Fund retains DoubleLine to manage the investment of its assets, to place orders for the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities, to administer its day-to-day operations, and to be responsible for overall management of the Fund's business affairs subject to the oversight of the Board of the Fund. DoubleLine is responsible for obtaining and evaluating economic, statistical, and financial data and for formulating and implementing investment programs in furtherance of each Fund's investment objective.
Administrator
U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, 615 E. Michigan Street, 3rd Floor, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, serves as each Fund's administrator. Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committees of DSL and DBL unanimously selected Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Deloitte also served as the independent registered public accounting firm of DSL and DBL for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018. Deloitte is located at 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1200, Costa Mesa, CA 92626.  Neither DSL nor DBL is aware of any direct financial or material indirect financial interest of Deloitte in DSL or DBL.
Representatives of Deloitte, if requested by any Shareholder of DBL or DSL, respectively, will be present at the Meeting via telephone to respond to appropriate questions from Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she chooses to do so.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by Deloitte.  The Audit Committee has adopted written policies relating to the pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by a Fund's independent registered public accounting firm (for purposes of this section, an "Independent Accountant").  Under the policies, each Fund's Treasurer reviews all potential audit and non-audit services and, with the assistance of, among others, outside counsel and the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, as the Treasurer may deem necessary or appropriate, categorizes the services before such services are presented to the Audit Committee for pre-approval.  For each proposed service, the Treasurer and the Independent Accountant make separate assessments to determine that the service will not impair the Independent Accountant's independence.
In addition, the Audit Committee pre-approves any permitted services to be provided by an Independent Accountant to DoubleLine and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with DoubleLine that provides ongoing services to a Fund (together, the "Accounting Affiliates") related to the operations or financial reporting of a Fund.  Although the Audit Committee does not pre-approve all services provided by an Independent Accountant to Accounting Affiliates (for instance, if the engagement does not relate to the operations or financial reporting of a Fund), DoubleLine must disclose to the Committee any non-audit services to be delivered by an Independent Accountant to an Accounting Affiliate.  In addition, the Committee receives an annual report disclosing all fees charged in each of the last two fiscal years by an Independent Accountant relating to Audit Services, Audit Related Services, Tax Services, and Other Non-Audit Services, each as defined below.
The Audit Committee may also from time to time pre-approve individual non-audit services to be provided to the Funds or an Accounting Affiliate that were not pre-approved as part of the process described above.  The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to its Chairperson.
Audit Fees
Audit Fees are fees related to the audit and review of the financial statements included in annual reports and registration statements, and other services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.  For each Fund's last two fiscal years, the Audit Fees billed to DBL and DSL by Deloitte are shown in the table below:

Other Business
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Funds' officers and DoubleLine know of no business to come before the Meeting other than as set forth in the Notice. If any other business is properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in their sole discretion.
Quorum, Adjournments and Methods of Tabulation  
A quorum for each Fund at the Meeting will consist of the presence in person or by proxy of thirty percent (30%) of the total Common Shares of the Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting or, even if a quorum is present, in the event that sufficient votes in favor of the proposal set forth in the Notice are not received by the time scheduled for the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting after the date set for the original Meeting, with no other notice than announcement at the Meeting, to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to the Proposals. In addition, if, in the judgment of the persons named as proxies, it is advisable to defer action on a Proposal, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting with respect to the Proposal for a reasonable time. Any adjournments with respect to a Proposal will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the Shares of the applicable Fund entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of such Proposal. They will vote against any such adjournment those proxies required to be voted against such Proposal.  The costs of any additional solicitation and of any adjourned session will be borne by the applicable Fund. Any proposals properly brought before the Meeting for which sufficient favorable votes have been received by the time of the Meeting will be acted upon and such action will be final regardless of whether the Meeting is adjourned to permit additional solicitation with respect to any other proposal.  In certain circumstances in which a Fund has received sufficient votes to approve a matter being recommended for approval by the Fund's Board, the Fund may request that brokers and nominee entities, in their discretion, withhold or withdraw submission of broker non-votes in order to avoid the need for solicitation of additional votes in favor of the proposal.
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting may be counted by persons appointed by the Funds as tellers or inspectors of election (the "Tellers/Inspectors") for the Meeting.  For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for a Fund, the total number of Common Shares present at the Meeting in person or by proxy will be counted, including Common Shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary voting power on a particular matter).  Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of any Proposal for the election of Trustees for the Funds.
Reports to Shareholders  
Each of DBL's and DSL's 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders began being mailed to shareholders of the relevant Fund on or about November 26, 2018.
Additional copies of the Funds' Annual and Semi Annual Reports may be obtained without charge from the Funds by calling (877) DLine11 (877-354-6311), downloading from www.doublelinefunds.com or by writing to the Funds at 333 South Grand Avenue, Suite 1800, Los Angeles, California 90071.
Shareholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting  
It is currently anticipated that each Fund's next annual meeting of Shareholders after the Meeting addressed in this Proxy Statement will be held in February 2020. Proposals of Shareholders intended to be presented at that annual meeting of each Fund must be received by the Fund no later than September 11, 2019 for inclusion in the Fund's proxy statement and proxy cards relating to that meeting. The submission by a Shareholder of a proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials does not guarantee that it will be included. Shareholder proposals are subject to certain requirements under the federal securities laws and must be submitted in accordance with each Fund's Bylaws. Shareholders submitting any other proposals for a Fund intended to be presented at the annual meeting held in 2020 (i.e., other than those to be included in the Fund's proxy materials) must ensure that such proposals are received by the Fund, in good order and complying with all applicable legal requirements and requirements set forth in the Fund's Bylaws, no earlier than November 10, 2019 and no later than November 25, 2019.1  If a Shareholder who wishes to present a proposal fails to notify the Fund within these dates, the proxies solicited for the meeting will have discretionary authority to vote on the Shareholder's proposal if it is properly brought before the meeting. If a Shareholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may still exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances consistent with the SEC's proxy rules. Shareholder proposals should be addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the Funds, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Funds, with a copy to Timothy W. Diggins, Ropes & Gray LLP, Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02199-3600. PLEASE EXECUTE AND RETURN THE ENCLOSED PROXY CARDS PROMPTLY TO ENSURE THAT A QUORUM IS PRESENT AT THE JOINT ANNUAL MEETING.  A SELF-ADDRESSED, POSTAGE-PAID ENVELOPE IS ENCLOSED FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE.
January 9, 1 To be timely, a shareholder notice (the "Shareholder Notice") must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Fund not less than forty-five (45) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the first anniversary date of the date on which the Fund first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting; provided, however, if and only if the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days before the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year and ends thirty (30) days after such anniversary date (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an "Other Annual Meeting Date"), such Shareholder Notice must be given in the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on (i) the date forty-five (45) days prior to such Other Annual Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth (10th) business day following the date such Other Annual Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed. Exhibit A to Proxy Statement
DOUBLELINE FUNDS TRUST
DOUBLELINE INCOME SOLUTIONS FUND
DOUBLELINE OPPORTUNISTIC CREDIT FUND
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
MAY 2017
[BEGIN TABLE]
I.  Background  
[END TABLE]
The Boards of Trustees of each of DoubleLine Funds Trust, DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund and DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (each, a "Board" and, collectively, the "Boards") have adopted this Charter to govern the activities of the Audit Committees of the Boards (each, an "Audit Committee" and, collectively, the "Audit Committees").  This Charter applies separately to each of DoubleLine Funds Trust, DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund and DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (collectively, the "Trusts" and, collectively with the series of DoubleLine Funds Trust, the "Funds") and the Board and Audit Committee of each, and shall be interpreted accordingly.
Attached as Appendix A is a list of required duties and tasks the Audit Committee generally expects to address at its regular meetings, as indicated.
[BEGIN TABLE]
II.  Scope of the Audit Committee  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee shall be responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work of the independent auditors employed by the Funds for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work.  Each such independent auditor shall report directly to the Committee.  The Audit Committee shall also perform those duties included in Appendix A to this Charter and shall also perform such other functions and have such powers as may be necessary or appropriate in the efficient and lawful discharge of the powers provided in this Charter.
[BEGIN TABLE]
III.  Authority and Responsibilities of the Audit Committee  
[END TABLE]
The function of the Audit Committee is oversight; it is management's responsibility to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control over financial reporting, and the auditor's responsibility to plan and carry out a proper audit.  Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of a Trust's service providers, including the auditors. The review of a Trust's financial statements by the Audit Committee is not an audit, nor does the Committee's review substitute for the responsibilities of a Trust's management for preparing, or the independent auditors for auditing, the financial statements.  Members of the Audit Committee are not employees of a Trust and, in serving on this Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors.  As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures.
In discharging his or her duties, a member of the Audit Committee is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:  (1) one or more officers of a Trust whom the Trustee reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Trustee reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or (3) a Board committee of which the Trustee is not a member.
The Audit Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the authority to retain and compensate special counsel and other experts, consultants, or advisers as the Committee deems necessary and the authority to obtain specialized training for Audit Committee members (at the expense of the relevant Trust or Fund), as appropriate.  Each Fund shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, for the payment of expenses of the Committee that the Audit Committee considers to be necessary or appropriate in fulfilling its purposes or carrying out its responsibilities under this Charter, including without limitation compensation of independent legal counsel or other advisers retained by the Audit Committee.  Expenditures made by the Audit Committee must be presented for review by the full Board, including by a majority of its Trustees who are not "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Trusts, at the Board's next regular meeting or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.  Should any costs need to be allocated among the Funds, the Audit Committees shall recommend to their respective Boards the appropriate allocation of such costs.
The Audit Committee may delegate any portion of its authority, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, to a subcommittee of one or more members.

DOUBLELINE FUNDS TRUST
DOUBLELINE INCOME SOLUTIONS FUND
DOUBLELINE OPPORTUNISTIC CREDIT FUND
QUALIFIED LEGAL COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE CHARTER
MAY  
I. Background
The Qualified Legal Compliance Committee Charter has been adopted by the Boards of Trustees (each a "Board" and, collectively, the "Boards") of each of the DoubleLine Funds Trust, DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund and DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (each, a "Trust" and, collectively, the "Trusts") to govern the activities of the Qualified Legal Compliance Committees of the Boards (each, a "QLCC" and, collectively, the "QLCCs").  This Charter applies separately to each Trust, and each series thereof, if any, and shall be interpreted accordingly.
Pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Section 307"), the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted rules to prescribe minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the SEC ("Attorney Conduct Rules" or "Rules").  Based on the Rules, this Qualified Legal Compliance Committee Charter (the "QLCC Charter") has been created to establish the procedures (the "Procedures") by which an attorney providing legal services to the Trust should report evidence of a material violation of the securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Trust, its officers, managers, employees or agents ("Report"), and to provide for the confidential receipt, retention and consideration of any such Report by the Audit Committee of the Trust, with the Audit Committee also being designated as and constituting a "qualified legal compliance committee" as defined in the Rules.  All attorneys to which these Procedures apply should provide the Audit Committee with a letter substantially in the form attached to these Procedures.
II. Policy
The Audit Committee shall be the QLCC of the Trust.  The QLCC will:

VIII. Attorney Standards and Procedures
A. Persons Subject to These Procedures
These Procedures apply to attorneys who are "appearing and practicing before the SEC" in the representation of the Trust.  An attorney is deemed to be "appearing and practicing before the SEC in the representation of the Funds" if the attorney is:
1. Providing legal services as an attorney for the Trust within the context of an attorney-client relationship with the Trust, whether the attorney is employed or retained by the Trust or by a service provider such as the Trust's investment adviser (the "Adviser"); and
2. a. Transacting any business with the SEC on behalf of the Trust, including communications in any form; or b. Representing the Trust in a SEC administrative proceeding or in connection with any SEC investigation, inquiry, information request, or subpoena; or c. Providing advice to the Trust with respect to United States securities laws or the SEC's rules or regulations thereunder regarding any document that the attorney has notice will be filed with or submitted to, or incorporated into any document that will be filed with or submitted to, the SEC, including the provision of such advice in the context of preparing, or participating in the preparation of, any such document; or d. Advising the Trust as to whether information or a statement, opinion, or other writing is required under United States securities laws or the SEC's rules or regulation thereunder to be filed with or submitted to, or incorporated into any document that will be filed with or submitted to, the SEC.
In addition, an attorney retained or directed by the Trust to investigate evidence of a material violation reported under these Procedures shall be deemed to be appearing and practicing before the SEC.
B.  Reporting Obligations
If an attorney who is appearing and practicing before the SEC in the representation of the Trust becomes aware of evidence of a material violation by the Trust or by any officer, director, employee or agent of the Trust, the attorney shall report such evidence to the QLCC.  Information on how to contact the QLCC's designee is set out below.
A "material violation" means a material violation of applicable United States federal or state securities law, a material breach of fiduciary duty arising under United States federal or state law, or a similar material violation of any United States federal or state law.6
When it adopted the implementing rules under Section 307, the SEC did not define the term "material" but intends the term to have the same meaning that it has under the federal securities laws.  In TSC Indus. v. Northway, Inc., the United States Supreme Court held that a fact is material if there is "a substantial likelihood that the . . . fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available." 426 U.S. 438, 449 (1976).  The Supreme Court also noted that determinations of materiality require "delicate assessments of the interferences a 'reasonable shareholder' would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him . . ." Id. at 450.  Materiality is ordinarily to be determined by the trier of fact in light of all of the facts and circumstances. Id. at 445.
A "breach of fiduciary duty" means any breach of fiduciary or similar duty to the issuer recognized under an applicable federal or state statute or at common law, including but not limited to misfeasance, nonfeasance, abdication of duty, abuse of trust, and approval of unlawful transactions.1
6 17 CFR Part 205.
Under the Attorney Conduct Rules, an attorney becomes aware of "evidence of a material violation" if he or she has credible evidence, based upon which it would be unreasonable, under the circumstances, for a prudent and competent attorney not to conclude that it is reasonably likely that a material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur.
It is reasonable for an attorney not to conclude that there is a material violation while the attorney is in the process of inquiring or consulting with others regarding the potential violation.  Such inquiry and consultation reasonably may be conducted as long as (1) a Report is timely made to the QLCC if the attorney concludes that it is reasonably likely that a material violation has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur, and (2) the inquiry and/or consultation do not unduly delay the submission of a Report.
A Report may be made to the QLCC directly, either in person, by telephone, by e-mail, electronically, in writing or by any other means deemed appropriate by any such attorney under the circumstances. Initial reports generally shall be made to the chairperson of the QLCC, but reports may be made to any member of the QLCC, who then shall be responsible to convene the QLCC to determine an appropriate course of action.
In making a Report, the reporting attorney should explain the facts supporting his or her conclusion that he or she has become aware of evidence of a material violation by the Trust, any officer, manager, employee or agent of the Trust, as well as explain the general basis for the Report and the attorney's concern.
By communicating such information to the Audit Committee, an attorney does not reveal client confidences or secrets or privileged or otherwise information related to the attorney's representation of the Trust.
IX. Committee Resources
The QLCC shall have the resources to discharge all of its responsibilities, including but not limited to the authority to select, retain, terminate and approve the fees and other retention terms of special or independent counsel or any other experts or advisers as determined to be necessary or appropriate without seeking approval of management of the Trust. Expenditures made by the QLCC must be presented for review by the full Board, including by a majority of its Disinterested Trustees, at the Board's next regular meeting or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.  Costs incurred by the QLCC in performing its functions under this Charter shall be borne by the Trust. Should any costs need to be allocated between Trusts for any reason, the QLCCs shall recommend to their respective Boards the appropriate allocation of such costs.

1. Provide us with a written statement agreeing to notify and consult the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee of the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Committee") in the event that, subject to your reasonable discretion and ethical obligations, an attorney believes that a formal report to the Committee is warranted under the SEC Attorney Conduct Rules and/or the Procedures;
