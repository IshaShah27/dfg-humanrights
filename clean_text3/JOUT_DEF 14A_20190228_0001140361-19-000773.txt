PROXY STATEMENT
For The 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders
To Be Held On February 28, 2019
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the
2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on February 28, 2019:
The Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Accompanying Annual Report on Form 10-K are Available at www.proxyvote.com
This Proxy Statement, which is first being mailed on or about January           11, 2019, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2018, is         furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Johnson Outdoors Inc., (the "Company"), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, to be used at the Annual Meeting         of Shareholders of the Company to be held on Thursday, February 28, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Company's headquarters, located at 555 Main Street, Racine, Wisconsin, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof (the "Annual Meeting").
You may vote in any of the following ways:
1) attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person by ballot;
2) complete the enclosed proxy card and then sign, date and return it in the postage pre‑paid envelope provided; or              
3) vote by telephone or the Internet by following the instructions supplied on the proxy card.
If you submit a proxy now, your right to vote at the Annual Meeting is not waived should you decide to attend in person.
Shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted at the         Annual Meeting and, when instructions have been given by the shareholder, will be voted in accordance with those instructions.  If you submit a proxy without giving voting instructions, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your         shares: (1) FOR the election of the directors named in this Proxy         Statement, (2) FOR the ratification of RSM US LLP as the Company's         independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019, and (3) FOR approval of the non-binding advisory proposal on executive compensation.
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company does not expect any matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals set       forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the meeting to another time or place, a properly       executed proxy gives the persons named as proxies on the proxy card authority to vote on such matters.  The individuals named and acting as proxies will have the authority to vote on those matters according to their best judgment to the same extent       as the person delivering the proxy would be entitled to vote.  If the Annual Meeting is adjourned or postponed, a proxy will remain valid and may be voted at the adjourned or postponed meeting.
Page 2 of 44
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is actually voted by         giving written notice to the Secretary of the Company, requesting a ballot at the Annual Meeting and voting in person or by submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a         later date.  Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. If you have given voting instructions to a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian that holds your shares in "street name," you may revoke those instructions         by following the directions given by the broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian.  If a shareholder properly signs and returns the proxy card but does not specify how to vote, then the shareholder's shares will be voted FOR the election of the directors listed in the enclosed proxy, FOR the ratification of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year,         and FOR approval of the non-binding advisory proposal on executive         compensation.
Telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to give their voting       instructions and to confirm that shareholders' instructions have been properly recorded.  Shareholders voting via the Internet should understand that there might be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access       providers and telephone companies that the shareholder must bear.
The record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the         Annual Meeting is December 21, 2018.  On the record date, the Company had outstanding and entitled to vote 8,825,790 shares of Class A common stock and 1,211,602 shares of Class B common stock.  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast       at the Annual Meeting, represented either in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum with respect to the meeting.  Holders of Class A common stock, voting as a separate class, elect three directors and are         entitled to one vote per share for directors designated to be elected by holders of Class A common stock. Holders of Class B common stock elect the remaining directors and are entitled to one vote per share for directors designated to be elected by         holders of Class B common stock.  Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting together as a single voting group are entitled to vote on the proposal to ratify RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting         firm for the 2019 fiscal year, and to vote to approve the non-binding advisory proposal on executive compensation.  The holders of Class A common stock are entitled         to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on these proposals.  Approval of any other matter not specified in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders that may properly be presented       at the Annual Meeting will require that the number of votes properly cast in favor of such matter exceed the number of votes properly cast against such matter, with the holders of the Class A common stock entitled to one vote per share and the       holders of Class B common stock entitled to ten votes per share.  Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by brokers in "street name," voting on certain matters due to discretionary authority or instructions from the beneficial owners but       not voting on other matters due to lack of authority to vote on such matters without instructions from the beneficial owner) will count toward the quorum requirement but will not count toward the determination of whether the directors are elected or       whether such other matters are approved.  The Inspector of Election appointed by our Board of Directors will count the votes and ballots.
Notice: The Annual Report to Shareholders, which           contains certain additional information about the Company not required to be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, is available this year to shareholders at https://www.johnsonoutdoors.com/annual-report, 24 hours a day and free of charge.  The Company is not including the information contained on or           available through its website as part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Proxy Statement.

PROPOSAL 1:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Nine directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the         next annual meeting of shareholders or until their respective successors have been duly elected.  The Company's Articles of Incorporation provide that holders of the Company's Class A common stock have the right to elect 25 percent, or the next         highest whole number, of the authorized number of directors and the holders of the Company's Class B common stock are entitled to elect the remaining directors.  At the Annual Meeting, holders of Class A common stock will be entitled to elect three         directors and holders of Class B common stock will be entitled to elect six directors.  Terry E. London, John M. Fahey, Jr., and William ("Bill") D. Perez (the "Class A Directors") are the Board nominees designated to be voted on by the holders of         Class A common stock, and Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, Thomas F. Pyle, Jr., Katherine Button Bell, Edward F. Lang, Richard ("Casey") Sheahan, and Edward Stevens (the "Class B Directors") are the Board nominees designated to be voted on by the holders         of Class B common stock.  As indicated below, the individuals nominated by our Board of Directors are incumbent directors.
Properly completed proxies (whether by Internet, telephone or mail)         received from holders of Class A common stock will, unless otherwise directed, be voted for the three nominee Class A Directors and properly completed proxies (whether by Internet, telephone or mail) received from holders of Class B common       stock will, unless otherwise directed, be voted for the six nominee Class B Directors.  Proxies of holders of Class A common stock cannot be voted for more than three persons         and proxies of holders of Class B common stock cannot be voted for more than six persons.  Class A Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Class A common stock and Class B Directors are elected by a plurality of the         votes cast by the holders of Class B common stock, in each case assuming a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.  "Plurality" means that the individuals who receive the largest number of votes cast by holders of the class of common stock         entitled to vote in the election of such directors are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the Annual Meeting by such class.  Consequently, the nine directors receiving the most votes, taking into account the         Company's two class voting structure, will be elected to the Board of Directors.
Director Qualifications
The following table provides information as of the date of this Proxy         Statement about each nominee for election to the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting.  The Company anticipates the nominees for election as directors will be candidates when the election is held.  However, if any of the nominees should be         unable or unwilling to serve, the proxies, pursuant to the authority granted to them by the Board of Directors and taking into account our two class voting structure,         will have discretionary authority to select and vote for substituted nominees (except where the proxy withholds authority with respect to the election of directors).  The information presented includes information each nominee or director has given         the Company about his or her age, his or her principal occupation and business experience for at least the past five years, and the names of other publicly-held companies of which he or she currently serves as a director or has served as a director         during the past five years.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly evaluates the mix of experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of the Company's directors using a matrix of areas that the Committee considers         important for the Company's business and its strategic objectives.  In addition to the information presented below regarding the nominee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Nominating and Corporate Governance         Committee to the conclusion that the nominee should serve as a director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considered the qualifications and criteria described below under "Corporate Governance Matters – Director Nominations"         with the objective of creating a complementary mix of directors.

The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as part of, or incorporating such       information by reference into, this Proxy Statement.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
The Company is committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which are intended to serve the long-term         interests of the Company and its shareholders.  The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which the Company has published on its website at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.
Director Independence
The Board of Directors has determined that the Company is a "Controlled Company," as defined in NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Rule 5615(c)(1).  The       Board has based this determination on the fact that Helen P. Johnson-Leipold is deemed to be the beneficial owner of more than 50 percent of the voting power of the Company.  The Company, therefore, is exempt from certain independence requirements of       the NASDAQ Stock Market rules, including the requirement to maintain a majority of independent directors on the Company's Board of Directors and the requirement to maintain a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee       composed entirely of independent directors. Notwithstanding such exemption, the Board of Directors has reviewed the independence of the nominees for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting under the applicable standards of the NASDAQ Stock       Market.  Based upon this review, of the nine nominees, the Board of Directors has determined that each of the following directors was independent under the NASDAQ listing standards:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Katherine Button Bell  
   John M. Fahey, Jr.  
   Edward F. Lang  
   Terry E. London  
   William ("Bill") D. Perez  
   Thomas F. Pyle, Jr.  
   Richard ("Casey") Sheahan  
   Edward Stevens  
[END TABLE]
Page 10 of 44
The Board of Directors determined that Ms. Johnson-Leipold was not independent in accordance with the NASDAQ standards because she is an executive       officer of the Company.
Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors determines whether it is appropriate to combine or separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer       depending on the Company's circumstances at the time.  Ms. Johnson‑Leipold currently serves as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Ms. Johnson-Leipold possesses extensive experience in the industries in       which the Company operates, and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges the Company faces, and is thus best positioned to develop agendas and highlight issues that ensure that the Board of Directors' time and attention are       focused on the most critical matters.  In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that this leadership structure is optimal because it believes that having one leader serving as both the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer provides decisive,       consistent and effective leadership, as well as clear accountability.  Having one person serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also enhances the Company's ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to its       shareholders, employees, and business partners, particularly during times of turbulent economic and industry conditions.  Although the Company believes that the combination of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is appropriate under       current circumstances, it will continue to review this issue periodically to determine whether, based on the relevant facts and circumstances, separation of these offices would serve the Company's best interests and the best interests of its       shareholders.
Thomas F. Pyle, Jr., the Company's Vice Chairman of the Board, serves as the Company's lead outside or independent director.  In his capacity as lead outside or independent director, Mr. Pyle coordinates the activities of the independent directors and serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent       directors.  Mr. Pyle also presides at the executive sessions of the independent directors and has the authority to call additional executive sessions or meetings of the independent directors.
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The Company has established a Risk Committee, which is primarily         responsible for the Company's enterprise risk assessment and enterprise risk management policies.  The Risk Committee is co-chaired by the Company's Chief Financial Officer and its Senior Managing Director, Legal Affairs and includes various other         members of senior management.  The role of the Board of Directors in the Company's risk oversight process includes receiving reports and presentations from the Risk         Committee on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory, strategic and reputational risks, and any measures taken to mitigate such risks.  The Board of Directors regularly reviews and discusses         areas of material risk at its meetings.
As noted above, the Company has established a Risk Committee, which is primarily responsible for the Company's enterprise risk assessment and       overseeing enterprise risk management.  Notwithstanding such delegation of responsibility by the Company's Board of Directors, the Board has reserved to the Company's Compensation Committee primary oversight responsibility to ensure that compensation       programs and practices of the Company do not encourage unreasonable or excessive risk-taking and that any risks are subject to appropriate controls.  As part of this process, the Company (with the oversight of the Compensation Committee) designs the       Company's overall compensation programs and practices, including incentive compensation for both executives and non-executive employees, in a manner intended to support its strategic priorities and initiatives to enhance long-term sustainable value       without encouraging unnecessary or unreasonable risk-taking.  At the same time, the Company recognizes that its goals cannot be fully achieved while avoiding all risk.  The Compensation Committee (along with assistance from management) periodically       reviews the Company's compensation programs and practices in the context of its risk profile, together with its other risk mitigation and risk management programs, to ensure that these programs and practices work together for the long-term benefit of       the Company and its shareholders.  Based on its recently completed review of the Company's compensation programs, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company's incentive compensation policies for both executive and non-executive employees       have not materially and adversely affected the Company by encouraging unreasonable or excessive risk-taking in the recent past, are not likely to have a material adverse effect in the future and provide for multiple and reasonably effective       safeguards to protect against unnecessary or unreasonable risk-taking.

Director Nominations
The Company has a standing Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  Based upon the review described under "Corporate Governance Matters –       Director Independence," the Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent under the applicable standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominees recommended by shareholders.  Recommendations for consideration       by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should be sent to the Secretary of the Company in writing, together with appropriate biographical information concerning each proposed nominee, including the following information: (1) the name,       address (business and residence), date of birth and principal occupation or employment (present and for the past five years) of each person whom the shareholder proposes to be considered as a nominee; (2) the number of shares of the common stock (of       each class) beneficially owned (as defined by section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by each such proposed nominee; (3) any other information regarding such proposed nominee that would be required to be disclosed in a       definitive proxy statement to shareholders prepared in connection with an election of directors pursuant to section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and (4) the name and address (business and residential) of the shareholder       making the recommendation and the number of shares of the common stock (regardless of class) beneficially owned (as defined by section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by the shareholder making the recommendation.  The       Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish additional information as may be reasonably required to determine the qualifications of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.  The Company's Bylaws also set forth certain       requirements for shareholders wishing to nominate director candidates directly for consideration by the shareholders.  With respect to an election of directors to be held at an annual meeting, a shareholder must, among other things, give notice of       intent to make such a nomination to the Secretary of the Company in advance of the meeting in compliance with the terms and within the time period specified in the Bylaws. Pursuant to these requirements, a shareholder must give a written notice of       intent to the Secretary of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however,       that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the       date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date       of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company.
Page 12 of 44
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any nominee recommended by a shareholder in accordance with the preceding paragraph under the same           criteria as any other potential nominee.  In identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors seeks to ensure that the Board of Directors possesses, in the aggregate,           the strategic, managerial and financial skills and experience necessary to fulfill its duties and to achieve its objectives, and seeks to ensure that the Board of Directors is comprised of directors who have broad and diverse backgrounds,           possessing knowledge in areas that are of importance to the Company.  In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes it is important that at least one director have the requisite experience and expertise to be designated           as an "audit committee financial expert."  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee looks at each nominee on a case‑by‑case basis regardless of who recommended the nominee.  In looking at the qualifications of each candidate to determine           if their election would further the goals described above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account all factors it considers appropriate, which may include strength of character, mature judgment, career specialization,           relevant technical skills or financial acumen, diversity of viewpoint and industry knowledge.  At a minimum, each director nominee must have displayed the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, values and sound business judgment.            In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that the following specific qualities and skills are necessary for all Company directors to possess:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A director should be highly accomplished in his or her respective field, with superior credentials and recognition.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A director should have expertise and experience relevant to the Company's business and strategic objectives, and be able to offer advice and guidance to the Chief                    Executive Officer based on that expertise and experience.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A director must have time available to devote to activities of the Board of Directors and to enhance his or her knowledge of the Company's business.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A director should have demonstrated the ability to work well with others.  The Company does not have a formal policy for the consideration of diversity by the                    Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in identifying nominees for director.  Diversity is one of the factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider and in this respect diversity may include race, gender,                    national origin or other characteristics.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considered several candidates for appointment to the Board of Directors in fiscal 2018 and in the       early part of fiscal 2019.  Based on the considerations described above (including as referenced in the biography and related discussion of director qualifications), and further due diligence led by Mr. Fahey, one of the Company's outside directors       and Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nominated and the Board of Directors appointed William ("Bill") D. Perez as a director on December 4, 2018.  Mr. Perez was       recommended to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Perez's addition to the Board of Directors increased the size of the Board to nine members.
Communications between Shareholders and the       Board of Directors; Director Attendance at Annual Meetings
Shareholders may communicate with the Board of Directors by writing to the Board of Directors (or, at the shareholder's option, to a specific       director) care of the Secretary of the Company at Johnson Outdoors Inc., 555 Main Street, Suite 342, Racine, Wisconsin 53403. Subject to the conditions described below, the Secretary will ensure that this communication (assuming it is properly       addressed to the Board of Directors or to a specific director) is delivered to the Board of       Directors or the specified director, as the case may be. Each such communication should indicate that the sender is a shareholder of the Company and that the sender is directing the communication to one or more individual directors or to the Board of       Directors as a whole.
Page 13 of 44
All communications will be compiled by the Company's Secretary and submitted to the Board of Directors or the individual directors on an as needed       basis unless such communications are considered, in the reasonable judgment of the Secretary, to be improper for submission to the intended recipient(s).  Examples of shareholder communications that would be considered improper for submission       include, without limitation, customer complaints, solicitations, communications that do not relate directly or indirectly to the Company or its business or communications that relate to improper or irrelevant topics.  The Secretary may also attempt       to handle a communication directly where appropriate, such as where the communication is a request for information about the Company or where it is a stock-related matter.
Directors are encouraged to attend the Company's Annual Meeting of         Shareholders.  All of the incumbent directors who were serving as a director at the time of the meeting attended the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders that occurred on March 1, 2018.
Employee Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics; Corporate Governance Guidelines; and Procedures for Reporting of Accounting       Concerns
The Company has adopted an Employee Code of Business Conduct (the "Code of         Conduct").  The Company requires all directors, officers and employees to adhere to the Code of Conduct in addressing legal and ethical issues encountered in conducting their work.  The Code of Conduct requires the Company's directors, officers and         employees to avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all applicable laws and other legal requirements, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in the Company's best interests.  The Company has placed a         copy of the Code of Conduct on its website located at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.           In addition, all directors, officers and salaried employees are required to complete compliance training on the Code of Conduct and certain other subjects.
The Company also adopted a Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer         and Senior Financial and Accounting Officers (the "Code of Ethics"), which governs the conduct of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and its other senior financial and accounting officers and executives.  The Code of         Ethics supplements the Code of Conduct and is intended to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of conflicts of interest; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the         Company's public documents; promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations; ensure the prompt reporting of violations of the Code of Ethics; and provide accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics.  The Company has placed a copy of         the Code of Ethics on its website located at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.  The         Company intends to disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics on its corporate website.
In addition, the Company has adopted a set of Corporate Governance         Guidelines (the "Corporate Governance Guidelines").  The Corporate Governance Guidelines have been established to assist the Board of Directors in the exercise of its responsibilities and to reflect the Board's commitment to monitoring the         effectiveness of policy and decision making at both the Board and management levels.  The Corporate Governance Guidelines address issues such as composition of the Board, independence criteria for Board members, Board leadership, evaluating         performance of the Board, directors' responsibilities, the Board's relationship with senior management, Committee matters and director continuing education.  The Company has placed a copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines on its website         located at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.
Page 14 of 44
Further, the Company has established "whistle-blower procedures" which provide a process for the confidential and anonymous submission, receipt,       retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters.  These procedures provide protections to employees who report possible Company misconduct.
Assessing the Performance of the Board and Individual Directors
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for annually reporting to the Board of Directors regarding the Committee's       assessment and evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole.  This report and assessment is discussed with the full Board and includes specific review of performance areas in which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes a       better contribution could be made.  The purpose of this assessment and evaluation is to increase the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and not necessarily to focus on individual Board members.
Hedging and Margin Account Policies
The Company's stock trading policies prohibit directors and the Company's employees, including its executive officers, from (i) purchasing any       financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's common stock, including zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts; (ii) engaging in short sales related to the Company's common stock; and       (iii) maintaining margin accounts.  All transactions in Johnson Outdoors securities by directors and executive officers must be pre-cleared with the Company's Chief Financial Officer and its Senior Managing Director, Legal Affairs.
AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee is comprised of four members of the Company's Board of         Directors.  Based upon the review described under "Corporate Governance Matters – Director Independence," the Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent under the applicable standards and rules of the         NASDAQ Stock Market and the rules of the SEC.  The duties and responsibilities of the Company's Audit Committee are set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, which may be found on the Company's website at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.
In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for the quality and       integrity of the financial reporting practices of the Company.  While the Audit Committee has oversight responsibility, the primary responsibility for the Company's financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over       financial reporting and related internal controls and procedures rests with management, and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements.  In discharging its oversight       responsibility as to the audit process, the Audit Committee has:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2018 with the Company's management and with the Company's                    independent registered public accounting firm;

Page 16 of 44
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and pre-approving any non-audit services to be performed by the Company's independent registered       public accounting firm.  These non-audit services are evaluated by the Audit Committee taking into account scope, fees, and applicable laws and regulations (including SEC rules) related to the independence of the independent registered public       accounting firm. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee to act between meetings of the Audit Committee for amounts up to $50,000.  Any pre-approval given by the Chairman of the Audit       Committee pursuant to this delegation is presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
Each new engagement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to perform non-audit services has been approved in advance by       the Audit Committee or the Chairman of the Audit Committee pursuant to the foregoing procedures.
PROPOSAL 2:  RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Our Audit Committee has appointed RSM US LLP as the independent registered         public accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019. Unless otherwise directed, proxies will         be voted FOR the ratification of such appointment.
Although this appointment is not required to be submitted to a vote of shareholders, our Board of Directors believes it appropriate as a matter of       policy to request that our shareholders ratify the appointment.  If shareholder ratification is not received, the Board of Directors will reconsider the appointment, and may retain that firm or another firm without resubmitting the matter to the       Company's shareholders.  Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such change would be in the Company's best       interests.
It is expected that a representative of RSM US LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or       she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
If a quorum exists, the approval of the ratification of RSM US LLP requires that the number of votes properly cast for this proposal exceed the       number of votes properly cast against this proposal.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count toward the determination of whether this proposal is approved and will have no impact on the vote.
Board of Directors Recommendation
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the independent registered public       accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019.
STOCK OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS
The following table sets forth certain information as of October       17, 2018 regarding the beneficial ownership of each class of Company common stock by each director, each person known by the Company to own beneficially more than 5 percent of         either class of the Company's common stock (including any "group" as set forth in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), each of the officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement (the "named executive officers"), and all         directors and current executive officers as a group based upon information furnished by such persons or in information otherwise publicly available in filings with the SEC.
Page 17 of 44
The Company has determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the         rules of the SEC.  Except as indicated in the footnotes, the persons listed below have sole voting and investment power over the shares beneficially owned.  Shares of common stock subject to options that are either currently exercisable or         exercisable within 60 days of October 17, 2018 or restricted stock units (with each unit representing one share of Class A common stock issuable on such vesting date)         which are vested or which vest within 60 days of October 17, 2018 are treated as outstanding (but only to the extent the reporting person has not made an election or         deferral of receipt of the underlying shares as of such date) and beneficially owned by the holder for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of the holder.  However, these shares are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of         computing the percentage ownership of any other person, except with respect to restricted stock units that have vested and been issued as shares of Class A common stock.  The table lists applicable percentage ownership based on 8,820,057       shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of October 17, 2018 plus restricted stock units which vested within 60 days of that date and 1,211,686 shares of Class B common stock outstanding as of October 17, 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis addresses the Company's compensation            philosophy, objectives, process and actions specific to fiscal 2018, and the first part of fiscal 2019 prior to the date of this Proxy Statement, for the Company's       current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Throughout this Proxy Statement, these two executive officers are referred to as the "named executive       officers."  Ultimate responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring the total compensation of the named executive officers rests with the Compensation       Committee of the Board of Directors.  The named executive officers for fiscal 2018 were:
Page 20 of 44
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· David W. Johnson, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation of these individuals is presented in the tables and other quantitative information that follows this section.
Our Compensation Philosophy
Johnson Outdoors believes it is important to provide compensation that at a minimum reflects base salary levels which are competitive with       executive officers in other industry-related public companies of similar structure and size.  The Company further believes that it is appropriate and desirable to have meaningful performance-based incentive plans for our named executive officers to       help attract and retain high performing individuals and drive positive economic performance and enhanced shareholder value.  Further, these incentive plans should constitute a meaningful portion of the total compensation opportunity for the Company's named executive officers, with a balanced focus on short and long-term performance.  This philosophy is the foundation for the following objectives.
Our Compensation Objectives
The objectives of the Compensation Committee in establishing compensation arrangements for the Company's       named executive officers are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Attract, retain and motivate qualified executives who are important to the success of Johnson Outdoors with a straightforward, understandable compensation program;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Provide strong financial incentives, at reasonable cost, for positive financial performance and enhanced value of a shareholders' investment in the Company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Create compensation packages which provide strong incentives for long-term success and performance without encouraging unreasonable or excessive risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation program that has been developed and implemented by the Compensation Committee to achieve these objectives for the named executive       officers has the following features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The compensation paid to our named executive officers on a yearly basis consists mainly of three components: 1) base salary; 2) potential annual cash bonuses based                    on performance; and 3) equity-based compensation in the form of grants of performance-based restricted stock units which are tied to achieving certain financial objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period, and with the                    exception of the CEO, grants of shares of restricted stock with service-based vesting criteria.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· We provide our named executive officers with a modest level of "perquisites" or other benefits that are not available to all of our employees.  "All Other                    Compensation" reported in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement constituted less than 5% of "Total Compensation" for our named executive officers for fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Base salaries are based on a periodic review of comparable compensation levels in the market which we believe to be competitive and fair.  See "Peer Group Benchmarking" below.  
[END TABLE]
Page 21 of 44
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Total compensation is higher for individuals with greater responsibility and a greater ability to influence company-wide performance.  In addition, the compensation                    program is designed so that a significant portion of total potential compensation for our named executive officers is at risk, in that it is contingent on actual company and personal performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Johnson Outdoors Inc. Worldwide Key Executives Discretionary Bonus Plan (the "Cash Bonus Plan") provides for annual bonus payouts based on (1) achieving                    specific company-wide objective financial criteria, including minimum financial performance targets that must be met as a condition to payouts under the Plan, and (2) achieving individual performance objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Johnson Outdoors Inc. 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive                    Plan") specifically prohibits discounted stock options.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Johnson Outdoors does not currently provide our named executive officers with any supplemental executive retirement plan or similar benefits or any severance or                    other special benefits (other than certain vesting of equity compensation under the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan) triggered by a change of control.  
[END TABLE]
The above noted compensation program features are described in detail in the following sections of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis,       entitled "Our Compensation Process," "Peer Group Benchmarking," "Components of Executive       Compensation" and "Change of Control and Severance Benefits."
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, pursuant to a non-binding, advisory vote, shareholders approved the compensation of our named executive       officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting by a vote of 19,601,182 shares in favor to 22,103 against (taking into account the fact that holders of         Class B shares of common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share when voting together with holders of Class A shares of common stock).  The Compensation Committee has         reviewed and considered the results of this advisory shareholder vote and believes it shows support by the shareholders for the Company's compensation philosophy and the executive compensation programs that implement this compensation philosophy.        The Company's Board of Directors has determined that shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation will occur every year.  The rules of the SEC require that we submit to         a vote of our shareholders once every six years a non-binding advisory proposal on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation (called         "Say on Pay" votes).  At the 2017 Annual Meeting, a plurality of shareholders voted in favor of annual advisory votes on executive compensation.
As described above under the Section "Corporate Governance Matters - The Board's Role in Risk Oversight," the Compensation Committee has primary       oversight responsibility to ensure that the Company's compensation programs and practices do not encourage unreasonable or excessive risk-taking and that any risks are subject to appropriate controls.
Our Compensation Process
Compensation for the Company's named executive officers and, at the option         of the Compensation Committee, other officers and senior managers, is evaluated and determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Compensation Committee consists of four independent directors under the applicable       standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market.  Thomas F. Pyle, Jr. is the Chairman of the Compensation Committee and the other members of the Compensation Committee are Terry E. London, John M. Fahey, Jr. and Katherine Button Bell.  Additional information       regarding the Compensation Committee is disclosed under the section "Directors' Meetings       and Committees – Compensation Committee" included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.
Page 22 of 44
The Compensation Committee views compensation as an ongoing process and may convene special meetings in addition to its regularly scheduled       meetings throughout the year for purposes of evaluation, planning and appropriate action.  Many key compensation decisions for a fiscal year are made during the fourth fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year (typically in September) as the       Compensation Committee sets certain compensation targets and objectives for the coming fiscal year or other performance period.  Additional compensation decisions are made during the first quarter of the fiscal year as the Compensation Committee       meets to review performance for the prior fiscal year and calculate and set target awards under the Cash Bonus Plan and Stock Incentive Plan for the current fiscal year or other performance period. Finally, at the first quarterly meeting held after       the fiscal year (typically in December of the following fiscal year), the Compensation Committee reviews performance for the prior fiscal year and calculates and confirms bonus payouts, if any, under the Cash Bonus Plan with respect to the prior       fiscal year, and calculates the number or amount of equity incentive compensation to be granted, if any, under the Stock Incentive Plan with respect to the target awards for the prior fiscal year or other performance period.  The Compensation       Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2018, as well as a meeting held on December 4, 2018 (the first quarter of fiscal 2019) in part to review performance for fiscal 2018.  The Compensation Committee typically holds an executive session without       management present.  The Compensation Committee receives and reviews materials in advance of each meeting, including materials that management believes will be helpful to the Committee as well as materials specifically requested by members of the       Committee.
The Company's management assists the Compensation Committee in its oversight and determination of compensation.  Management's role includes       assisting the Compensation Committee with evaluating employee performance, assisting with establishing individual and company-wide performance targets and objectives, recommending salary levels and equity incentive grants, providing financial data on       Company performance, providing calculations and reports on achievement of performance objectives and furnishing other information as requested by the Committee.  The Company's Chief Executive Officer works with the Compensation Committee in making       recommendations regarding overall compensation policies and plans as well as specific compensation levels for the Company's executive officers and other key employees, other than the Chief Executive Officer.  Members of management who were present       during Compensation Committee meetings held in fiscal 2018, and the first quarter of fiscal 2019, included the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President – Human Resources, and its Senior Managing Director, Legal       Affairs.  The Compensation Committee makes all decisions regarding the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer without the Company's Chief Executive Officer or any other member of the Company's management present.
The Compensation Committee's Charter authorizes the Committee to       engage any compensation consultants and other advisers as the Committee may deem appropriate, and requires that the Company provide the Committee with adequate funding to engage any compensation consultants or other advisers the Committee deems it appropriate to engage.  During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee directly engaged Pearl Meyer, an independent compensation consultant, to assist the Company with         reviewing its compensation practices and levels.  Pearl Meyer did not provide any other services to the Company or its affiliates during fiscal 2018 or during fiscal 2019 to date and the Company's Compensation Committee determined that the         engagement of Pearl Meyer to assist the Company with reviewing its compensation practices and levels did not create any conflicts of interest.  See "Peer Group       Benchmarking" below for additional information regarding this engagement.
Page 23 of 44
Peer Group Benchmarking
As noted above, during fiscal 2018 (as well as in prior years) the Company engaged Pearl Meyer to prepare comparative compensation reports for the       Compensation Committee to assist the Committee and the Company in setting compensation levels and targets for the named executive officers, directors and other members of senior management.  The Pearl Meyer comparative compensation reviews were based       upon publicly-disclosed data from a peer group described below, as well as general industry compensation survey data.  Pearl Meyer's reports included detailed analysis showing how the Company's compensation elements for each of (a) the Company's       named executive officers and senior management, including the base salary, short-term cash incentive compensation, equity incentive compensation and total compensation levels, and (b) the Company's directors, including the cash, equity and total       compensation levels, compared in each case to the peer group companies and general industry data included within the benchmark data.  The comparative compensation reports also contained recommendations on the Company's compensation policies for both       its named executive officers and senior management and for its directors.  Pearl Meyer also provided the Compensation Committee with detailed analysis on the Company's compensation programs in terms of design, metrics and time horizons for payouts       (including long-term incentive vesting schedules) to evaluate how the Company's programs compare with (i) the peer group companies and general industry data included within the benchmark data and (ii) the consultant's assessment of best practices.        Representatives of Pearl Meyer participated in person for two, and telephonically for one, of the Compensation Committee's meetings during fiscal 2018 to describe and discuss the results of their analysis during such year.  The Compensation Committee       used the results of these reports and analysis in setting the compensation levels and target compensation awards, including performance- and service-based vesting criteria, where applicable, for the Company's named executive officers and directors       for fiscal 2018 and 2019.  See "Components of Executive Compensation" below for additional information.
The companies comprising the peer group in the 2018 Pearl Meyer comparative report were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.  
   Deckers Outdoor Corp.  
   Callaway Golf Co.  
   Sturm, Ruger & Co. Inc.  
   American Outdoor Brands Corporation  
   Delta Apparel Inc.  
   iRobot Corporation  
   Twin Disc, Incorporated  
   Rocky Brands, Inc.  
   Nautilus Inc.  
   Black Diamond, Inc.  
   Marine Products Corp.  
   Escalade, Inc.  
[END TABLE]
While the peer group companies do not necessarily compete in the Company's specific industry or industries, they generally have similar       characteristics to Johnson Outdoors, including in terms of size and scale, a consumer discretionary product focus, the manufacturing of engineered products, and global operations.
Components of Executive Compensation
For our named executive officers, the primary components of total compensation for fiscal 2018 were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual cash incentive compensation under the Cash Bonus Plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Page 24 of 44
The Compensation Committee evaluates targeted total compensation levels for the named executive officers as well as how each component fits within       the targeted total compensation levels.  This evaluation is guided by the compensation objectives described above.  A large portion of potential compensation for the named executive officers is performance-based.  For performance-based compensation,       the Company combines annual cash incentives with long-term equity-based incentives.  The cash incentives are tied to annual, company-wide measures of operating performance and individual performance goals.  The long-term equity-based compensation for       fiscal 2018 was split, for executives other than the CEO, between the issuance of shares of restricted stock tied to service-based vesting criteria and an award of performance-based restricted stock units tied to achievement of certain financial       objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period.  During fiscal 2018, for the CEO, the long-term equity based compensation consisted solely of an award of performance-based restricted stock units tied to achievement of certain       financial objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period.  The long-term equity awards help promote our executive retention objectives and provide an incentive for long-term appreciation in our stock price, whereas the annual cash       incentives promote short-term financial growth and achievement of individual performance goals.
Base Salary.  Base salary is a key       component of executive compensation.  In determining base salaries, the Compensation Committee considers the named executive officer's qualifications and experience, responsibilities, past performance and goals and objectives, together with salary       levels for comparable positions at peer group companies and other similarly sized companies nationally, as covered in the above-referenced Pearl Meyer comparative report.  Base salaries of the named executive officers are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee to determine whether any adjustments are       necessary.  Base salary levels for our named executive officers are generally positioned to be competitive with market, as described above.
Annual Cash Incentives.  The named executive officers and other officers and senior managers determined by the Compensation Committee are eligible to receive annual cash incentives under the Cash       Bonus Plan.  While the Company principally relies on this Cash Bonus Plan for annual cash incentives, the Compensation Committee, on rare occasions, may decide to grant discretionary cash bonuses outside of this Plan based on special circumstances.        No such discretionary bonuses were granted in fiscal 2018.
The purpose of the Cash Bonus Plan is to drive continuous improvement year over year, enhance shareholder value and provide a framework for       determining incentive compensation for our named executive officers and other officers and senior managers that financially rewards them for achieving various Company and individual performance objectives.  As such, the Cash Bonus Plan is generally       comprised of the following two components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· certain pre-determined Company financial performance goals ("Company financial component"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· individual pre-established objectives for a participant (the "individual objectives component").  
[END TABLE]
The Company financial component promotes achieving Company-wide financial goals.  For fiscal 2018, we used a target level of pre-tax income and       achieving a specified level of working capital as a percentage of net sales as the Company financial component.  The Compensation Committee's purpose in using various performance measures for the Cash Bonus Plan is to support the attainment of       increased shareholder returns while being able to respond to changes both in our business and the overall economic environment each fiscal year.  For fiscal 2018, the Company financial component constituted 85% of the named executive officer's total       bonus opportunity under the Cash Bonus Plan.
The individual objectives component is typically tied to financial performance measures that the participant can best impact, including         profitability, working capital levels, sales growth, operational efficiency, market share growth, organizational development and innovation.  For fiscal 2018, the individual objectives component constituted 15% of the named executive officer's         total bonus opportunity under the Cash Bonus Plan.
Page 25 of 44
The Company financial component and the individual objectives component under the Cash Bonus Plan for the coming fiscal year are chosen and set       annually by the Compensation Committee at the last quarterly Compensation Committee meeting for the prior fiscal year (typically occurring in September).  Target bonus awards for the coming fiscal year for each named executive officer are also       generally approved at this meeting.  Target awards for each participant have historically ranged from 55% to 90% of the participant's base salary.  For fiscal 2018, the target was 90% of base salary for Ms. Johnson‑Leipold and 55% of base salary for       Mr. Johnson.  The Compensation Committee believes these target award opportunities are competitive with industry practices as reflected by the Pearl Meyer comparative report         described above.  The threshold or minimum financial performance level for payment of the fiscal 2018 awards under the Cash Bonus Plan was 70% of the financial performance target, in which event the participant would receive a payout at 25%       of the target bonus amount.
The Compensation Committee retains the final authority to approve individual bonus payments after completion of the applicable fiscal year and may,       in its sole discretion, reduce or eliminate bonuses which are otherwise earned during the fiscal year using the foregoing components or formula.  In determining whether to reduce or eliminate a bonus which was otherwise earned during a given fiscal       year, the Compensation Committee considers factors such as a minimum level of Company profitability and return of profits to shareholders.
With respect to awards made before November 2, 2017, the maximum amount payable under the Cash Bonus Plan during any fiscal year to any person whom       the Compensation Committee considered a covered employee within the meaning of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the "Code") was equal to $2,000,000.  For the Company financial component of the fiscal 2018 bonus, the       eligible bonus could have been paid out from 0 to 200% of the target bonus award allocated to this component.  The actual percentage earned inside this range is based on how well the Company performs compared to the goals for pre-tax income and       working capital as a percentage of net sales.  For fiscal 2018, the Company financial component exceeded goals and the bonuses were paid at 193% of the target bonus award for this component.  With respect to the individual objectives component of the       annual bonus, payouts also range from 0 to 200% of the target bonus award allocated to this component.  The actual percentage earned inside this range is based on how well the individual objectives are satisfied compared to applicable goals as       determined by the Compensation Committee.  For fiscal 2018, the individual objectives component of the bonus was paid at 67.5% of target bonus for Ms. Johnson‑Leipold and 75% of target bonus for Mr. Johnson.
Accordingly, for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee paid the following annual incentive bonuses to the named executive officers under the Cash       Bonus Plan:

Based upon Pearl Meyer's report prepared during fiscal 2018 as described above, the Compensation Committee has decided to generally keep the Cash       Bonus Plan in place for fiscal 2019 and to continue to have target awards split between an individual objectives component (15% of total bonus opportunity) and a Company financial component (85% of total bonus opportunity).  Additionally, with       respect to the Company financial component for fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee has determined to: (1) continue to use a target level of pre-tax income and a specified level of working capital as a percentage of net sales; (2) set the       threshold or minimum level for payouts of bonus awards at 70% of the target financial performance; (3) set the payment or funding amount at 25% of the target bonus amount for financial performance at 70% of target, which is the minimum performance       level for payouts of bonus awards; and (4) set the payment or funding amount at 200% of the target bonus amount at the maximum financial performance level.  The Company believes that the foregoing elements of the Cash Bonus Plan mitigate against       potential unnecessary risk taking because the plan contains a payout curve such that there is no one cliff event that has the potential to make a significant difference in the payout opportunity.
Equity Based Compensation.  The Company believes that equity-based compensation is an effective means of aligning the long-term interests of Company employees, including the named       executive officers, with Company shareholders.  The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to issue stock options, shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units, as well as other forms of equity-based compensation.  With       respect to fiscal 2018, awards to the named executive officers (other than the CEO) under the Stock Incentive Plan consisted of an award of shares of restricted stock subject to service-based vesting criteria to promote our retention objectives and       an award of performance-based restricted stock units tied to achievement of certain Company financial objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period.  With respect to fiscal 2018, for the CEO, the long-term equity-based compensation       consisted solely of an award of performance-based restricted stock units tied to achievement of certain financial objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period.
With respect to the portion of the equity-based award that is tied to Company performance, the Compensation Committee establishes pre-determined       financial performance goals for the Company at the last quarterly Compensation Committee meeting held during the prior fiscal year (typically in September).  The amount of the target award for each participant is set by the Compensation Committee       during the first quarterly Compensation Committee meeting held during the fiscal year (typically in December).
For fiscal 2018, the portion (or in the case of the CEO, the entire award) of the long-term equity-based incentive award that is performance-based       is tied to three-year sales and operating profit goals aligned with our strategic plan and consisted of an award of performance-based restricted stock units.  These performance-based restricted stock units include the following general provisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Fifty percent of the performance-based piece of the award is tied to achievement of cumulative net sales over a three year period (fiscal 2018 - 2020) and the                    remaining fifty percent is tied to achievement of cumulative operating profit over the same three year period (fiscal 2018 - 2020);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Awards are only paid if at least 80% of the target level of net sales or operating profit are met and maximum payouts are made if 120% or more of target levels of                    net sales or operating profit are achieved;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The payouts for achievement of the threshold levels of performance are equal to 50% of the target award amount.  The payouts for achievement of maximum levels of                    performance are equal to 150% of the target award amount.  Each of the financial metrics receives a fifty percent weighting in determining the aggregate award amount;  
[END TABLE]
Page 27 of 44
[BEGIN TABLE]
· To the extent earned, awards are issued in shares of Company common stock after the end of the three year performance period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Awards are subject to downward adjustments in the event the Company has not achieved a specified minimum average return on invested capital per year during the                    three year performance period.  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, the performance-based equity awards granted in fiscal 2018 to our named executive officers cover a three-year performance period       consisting of fiscal years 2018 through 2020, with vesting in December, 2020, depending on whether the performance criteria are satisfied.  The Compensation Committee again approved performance-based equity-based awards to our named executive       officers at the beginning of fiscal 2019.  These awards consisted of performance-based restricted stock units and also cover a three-year performance period consisting of fiscal years 2019 through 2021 with vesting in December 2021, depending on       whether the performance criteria are satisfied.
As noted above, the Company splits the long-term equity-based incentive award for participants other than our CEO between shares of restricted       stock tied to four year service-based cliff vesting and performance-based equity grants described above.  With respect to the portion of an equity-based award that is service-based, the Compensation Committee establishes the amount of the target       award at its first quarterly Compensation Committee meeting held during the fiscal year (typically in December).  The Compensation Committee reviews each of Company and participant performance for the fiscal year.  The Compensation Committee has       discretion, depending upon Company and participant performance for the applicable fiscal year, to reduce the value of the equity award which is tied to service-based vesting.  Any restricted shares which are granted for this service-based component       are subject to at least four year cliff vesting periods from the date of grant.
On December 6, 2017, consistent with the methodology described above, the Compensation Committee established a $700,000 performance award target       for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and a $175,000 performance-based award target and a $75,000 service-based award target for Mr. Johnson for fiscal 2018.  The number of restricted stock units granted under the performance-based award was determined using a       share price of $70.39 and resulted in a target grant of 9,945 units for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and 2,486 units for Mr. Johnson.  The actual number of shares tied to the performance-based awards to be earned, if any, will be determined based on       performance over the fiscal 2018-2020 period.  The service-based award for Mr. Johnson was also determined using a share price of $70.39 and resulted in a grant of 1,065 restricted shares.
On December 4, 2018, consistent with the methodology described above, the Compensation Committee established a $1,000,000 performance award target       for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and a $175,000 performance award target for Mr. Johnson for fiscal 2019.  For these performance-based awards, the number of restricted stock units granted was determined using a share price of $71.42 and resulted in a target       grant of 14,002  units for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and 2,450 units for Mr. Johnson.  The actual number of shares tied to the performance-based awards to be earned, if any, will be determined based on performance over the three year performance period, i.e. fiscal 2019-2021.  The Compensation Committee also approved a service-based award for Mr. Johnson at a value of $175,000.  The number of shares under       the service-based award  was determined using a share price of $71.42 and resulted in a grant of 2,450 restricted shares for Mr. Johnson.

The Compensation Committee approved performance-based equity awards to our named executive officers at the beginning of fiscal 2016 with fifty       percent of the performance-based award tied to achievement of cumulative net sales over a three year period (fiscal 2016 - 2018) and the remaining fifty percent tied to achievement of cumulative operating profit over the same three year period       (fiscal 2016 - 2018) other than the CEO which was 100% performance based.  These awards consisted of performance-based restricted stock units covering this three-year performance period with vesting in December 2018, depending on whether the       performance criteria were satisfied. These performance-based restricted stock units were awarded on December 1, 2015, and consisted of a performance award target to Ms. Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson of $400,000 and $65,000, respectively, or 16,556       and 2,690 performance-based restricted stock units, respectively.  The performance-based restricted stock units were granted on terms as were consistent with the general terms and conditions described above for the fiscal 2018 performance-based       equity award.  Under the terms of the award agreements, the payout of these performance-based equity awards could range from 0% to 150% of the target performance restricted stock unit award amount referenced above and were to be paid only if at least       80% of the target level of net sales or operating profit were met and maximum payouts were made if 120% or more of target levels of net sales or operating profit were achieved.  In addition, a certain minimum return on invested capital and       achievement of several qualitative factors was required, with a reduction to actual awards made if either or both were not fully achieved.  On December 4, 2018, after reviewing the Company's performance over the three year performance period and the       other factors described above, the Compensation Committee approved payment of these performance-based equity awards at 122.4% of the target award for each of Ms. Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson, respectively, or at 20,265 and 3,293 shares of the       Company's common stock for each of Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson, respectively.
Perquisites and Other Compensation. The named executive officers participate in other benefit plans generally available to all employees on the same terms as similarly situated employees,       including participation in medical, health, dental, disability, life insurance, 401(k) plans and other qualified and non-qualified retirement plans.  These benefits are included in the Summary Compensation Table provided below under the "All Other       Compensation" column.  In addition, named executive officers also participate in the Company's discretionary Executive Flexible Spending Account Plan which provides for reimbursement for certain expenses that relate to an executive's personal       financial planning and/or for purchases of office equipment.  This program is available to other key executives as well and the amounts typically range from $5,000 to $8,500 of potential reimbursement each calendar year, provided the eligible       participant submits the appropriate documentation.  Reimbursement under this plan is taxable income.  See the notes to the Summary Compensation Table for additional information on payments to the named executive officers during fiscal 2018 in       connection with this compensation program.
Change of Control and Severance Benefits
Historically, Johnson Outdoors has not entered into employment agreements with any named executive officers and does not have contractual       obligations to provide severance benefits to either of the named executive officers.  In the past, Johnson Outdoors has negotiated payment of certain severance benefits on a case-by-case basis with terminated named executive officers.  The amount and       type of severance benefits provided to these former named executive officers has depended upon the circumstances of the termination, the position of the former named executive officer and certain other performance-related factors.  Should Johnson       Outdoors pay severance benefits in the future to former named executive officers, we expect to do so on a case-by-case basis in accordance with prior practice.
Page 29 of Code section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction to a public corporation for non-performance-based compensation over $1,000,000 paid for         any fiscal year to each of the individuals who were, at the end of the fiscal year, the corporation's chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers, excluding the principal financial officer.  Prior to         January 1, 2018 there was an exception to this limit for "performance-based" compensation and most grants under the Stock Incentive Plan and Cash Bonus Plan are intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Code         section 162(m), including the requirement that such plans be approved by shareholders.  As a result, the Compensation Committee believes that such awards under these plans intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation"         under Code section 162(m) will not count against the $1,000,000 limit and will be deductible by Johnson Outdoors.  Other grants or compensation paid or imputed to individual executive officers covered by Code section 162(m) may not satisfy the         requirements for "performance-based compensation" and may cause "non-performance-based compensation" to exceed the $1,000,000 limit, and would then not be deductible by Johnson Outdoors to the extent it exceeds the $1,000,000 limit.  Although the         Compensation Committee designs certain components of executive compensation to preserve income tax deductibility, it believes that it is not in the shareholders' interest to restrict the Compensation Committee's discretion and flexibility in         developing appropriate compensation programs and establishing compensation levels and, in some instances, the Compensation Committee may approve compensation that is not fully deductible.
Timing of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Grants
Generally, grants of shares of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units to employees (other than inducement grants to new       employees) are made annually on the date of the first quarterly meeting of the Compensation Committee held in December of each year, after prior fiscal year earnings have been determined, and the amount of the actual grant can be calculated.  The       grant date is always the date of approval of the grant by the Compensation Committee.  Accordingly, to maintain flexibility and promote retention or individual goals, other compensation arrangements such as restricted stock grants and certain annual       incentive cash payments are not designed to satisfy the conditions of Code section 162(m) and therefore may not be deductible.
Report of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement with our management       and, based on such review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

 (1)  The named executive officers are eligible to receive annual incentive cash bonuses under the Cash Bonus Plan. The award of annual incentive cash bonuses under the                    Cash Bonus Plan is generally comprised of two components. The first component is based on the executive achieving pre-established individual objectives.  The second component is based on the Company achieving specified financial                    performance measures.  The amounts in this column reflect the individual objectives component of the named executive officer's annual bonus under the Cash Bonus Plan.  The second component based on the Company achieving specified                    financial performance measures is included in the column under the heading "Non-equity Incentive Plan Comp." when the specified financial performance measures are met.  
[END TABLE]
In determining each named executive officer's annual incentive cash bonus amount for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 performance, our       Compensation Committee allocated 15% of the target bonus to achieving the pre-established individual objectives component, and 85% to the Company achieving the Company financial component.  For each of the individual objectives component and the       Company financial component under the Cash Bonus Plan, the eligible bonus can be paid out from 0-200% of the target bonus amount for that component. The target bonus amounts for 2018, 2017 and 2016 for Ms. Johnson-Leipold were $656,511, $633,891, and       $614,059, and for Mr. Johnson were $211,224, $201,197, and $184,550, respectively.  If either or both components (individual objectives component and Company financial component) are achieved at targeted performance levels, the payout equals 100% of       the eligible bonus for such component.
For fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, the annual cash bonus under the Cash Bonus Plan with respect to achieving the individual       objectives component was $66,472, $80,821, and $78,292 for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and $23,763, $25,351, and $24,914 for Mr. Johnson, respectively.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   For fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, the annual cash bonus under the Cash Bonus Plan with respect to achieving the Company financial component related to achieving a                    minimum level of net income and achieving a specified level of working capital as a percentage of sales.  See footnote (3) below for a discussion of the payouts during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 to the named executive officers in                    connection with this Company financial component.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts in this column reflect the dollar value of long-term equity based compensation awards pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan granted during the fiscal                    years indicated in the table.  These amounts for each of fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 equal the fair value of restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock computed in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic                    718-10 on the date the restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock were granted.  Assumptions used in the calculation of the grant date fair value are included under the caption "Stock Ownership Plans" in the Notes to the                    Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in the fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2018 and such information is                    incorporated herein by reference.  With respect to fiscal 2018, the Company awarded Mr. Johnson 1,065 shares of restricted stock on December 6, 2017.  Additionally, Ms. Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson were granted 9,945 and 2,486,                    respectively, performance-based restricted stock units on December 6, 2017.   The table above includes the value of restricted stock units on the grant date based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions as reasonably                    determined by the Company.  The grant date fair value of each performance-based restricted stock unit award assuming the highest level of performance was achieved over the performance period (i.e., the maximum amount) would have equaled                    $1,050,000 and $262,500 for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson, respectively.

(3)  This column includes the dollar value of all amounts earned by the named executive officers under our Cash Bonus Plan which are based upon the specified Company                        financial component for the applicable fiscal year.  For fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, both of the Company's financial performance measures were exceeded and, therefore, payout amounts are included in this column.  For fiscal 2018,                        2017, and 2016, the annual cash bonus under the Cash Bonus Plan with respect to achieving the Company financial component was $1,077,006, $1,077,614, and $595,023 for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and $346,513, $342,034, and $178,829 for Mr.                        Johnson, respectively.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table sets forth information regarding all incentive plan awards that were granted to the named executive officers during fiscal       2018, including equity-based, non-equity based and other plan-based awards.  Disclosure on a separate line item is provided for each grant made to a named executive officer during the fiscal year.  Non-equity incentive plan awards are awards that are       not subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 and are intended to serve as an incentive for performance to occur over a specified period, and include performance bonus awards under the Cash Bonus Plan.  Equity incentive plan awards       include the performance-based restricted stock units awarded under the Stock Incentive Plan and are awards subject to a performance condition or a market condition as those terms are defined by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718.  We       did not grant any stock options during fiscal 2018.

  1.  These amounts show the range of payouts targeted for fiscal 2018 performance under the Cash                      Bonus Plan as described in the section of this Proxy Statement titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."  The                      Cash Bonus Plan entitles participants to earn bonus awards based upon Company financial performance and the participant's individual objectives for a given fiscal year.  The targeted bonus amounts are equal to a percentage of the named                      executive officer's base salary.  The target was set at 90% of the base salary for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and 55% of the base salary for Mr. Johnson for fiscal 2018.  For both the individual objectives component and the Company financial performance component of our annual bonus under the Cash Bonus                    Plan, the eligible bonus can be paid out from 0-200% of the target bonus amount for that component.  The target eligible bonus amounts for fiscal 2018 are set in the table above and represent the aggregate target under both the Company                    performance component and the individual objectives component.  If either or both components are met at targeted performance levels, the payout equals 100% of the eligible bonus for such component.  A participant may earn up to a maximum                    of 200% of the target bonus amount if the Company performance component is met at 160% of goal.  A participant may earn a minimum of 25% of the target bonus amount if the Company performance component reaches 70% of the goal.  The amount                    under the column "Maximum" is limited to 200% of the target bonus award.  See the following sections for additional information: "Summary Compensation Table" and "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."

  2.  These awards were issued under the Stock Incentive Plan and consisted of an award of performance-based restricted stock units tied to achievement of certain Company                    financial objectives to be measured over a three-year performance period.  For fiscal 2018, the performance-based award is tied to three-year sales and operating profit goals aligned with our strategic plan.  Fifty percent of the                    performance-based piece of the award is tied to achievement of cumulative net sales over a three year period (fiscal 2018 - 2020) and the remaining fifty percent is tied to achievement of cumulative operating profit over the same three                    year period (fiscal 2018 - 2020).  Awards are only paid if at least 80% of the target level of net sales and operating profit are met and maximum payouts are made if 120% or more of target levels of net sales and operating profit are                    achieved.  The payouts for achievement of the threshold levels of performance are equal to 50% of the target award amount.  The payouts for achievement of maximum levels of performance are equal to 150% of the target award amount. Each of                    the financial metrics receives a fifty percent weighting in determining the aggregate award amount. Awards are subject to downward adjustments in the event the Company has not achieved a specified minimum average return on invested                    capital per year during the three year performance period.  See "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" above for additional information on the terms of the performance-based restricted stock units issued to the named executive officers                    during fiscal 2018.  On December 6, 2017, consistent with the methodology described above, the Compensation Committee established a $700,000 performance award target for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and a $175,000 performance award target for Mr.                    Johnson.  The number of performance-based restricted stock units at target was determined using a grant date share price of $70.39 and resulted in a target grant of 9,945 units for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and 2,486 units for Mr. Johnson.  The                    actual number of shares tied to the performance-based awards to be earned, if any, will be determined based on performance over the fiscal 2018-2020 period. The threshold number of shares equals 50% of the target number of shares and the                    maximum number of shares equals 150% of the target number of shares.

  3.  The restricted stock award was granted on December 6, 2017 and vests on December 6, 2021, the fourth anniversary of the grant date. This award was issued by the                      Compensation Committee to further the Company's retention objectives and was based upon a target award value of $75,000 for Mr. Johnson established by the Compensation Committee on December 6, 2016.  On December 6, 2017 the Compensation                      Committee approved the payment of the award at the target level with the number of shares of restricted stock issued under the award being based upon the grant date fair value per share of $70.39.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  The value of the restricted stock and restricted stock units is based upon the December 6, 2017 grant date fair value of $70.39 per share for each share of                      restricted stock and each restricted stock unit (based upon the target number of shares issued as part of the award), determined pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718.  The grant date fair value is the amount the                      Company expenses in the financial statements over the award's vesting schedule.  See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2018 for the                      assumptions relied on in determining the value of these awards.

Employment Agreements
The Company has not entered into any employment agreements with the named executive officers.
Incentive Compensation Recovery (Clawback) Policy
The Company's Board of Directors has adopted an Incentive Compensation Recovery (Clawback) Policy effective as of December 2, 2015.  A copy of this       policy is available on the Company's website at www.johnsonoutdoors.com, 24 hours a day and free of charge.  The Company is not including the information contained on or available through its website as part of, or incorporating such information by       reference into, this Proxy Statement.  The policy is administered by our Board of Directors and covers all current and former executive officers.  Under this policy, the Board of Directors will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess       incentive compensation awarded or paid in the event of an accounting restatement resulting from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under federal securities laws.  The incentive compensation covers all awards granted or paid       during the last three completed fiscal years including, but not limited to, annual performance bonuses (including any amounts deferred) and long-term incentive grants, including any of the following, provided that, such compensation is granted,       earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure (as defined in the policy): cash bonuses and incentive cash compensation; stock options; restricted stock; restricted stock units; and performance-based       units.  The amount to be recovered is the excess amount of the incentive compensation received by the executive officer based on the erroneous data from the accounting restatement.  The policy applies to all incentive compensation approved, awarded       or granted after the effective date of the policy.

Post-Employment Compensation
Pension Benefits
Currently, Johnson Outdoors does not provide the named executive officers         with pension benefits.  U.S.-based executive officers are eligible to participate in the Johnson Outdoors Retirement and Savings 401(k) Plan on the same terms as other U.S.-based employees.  In any plan year, the Company may make matching         contributions to a participant's account equal to 50 percent of the first six percent of an employee's annual wages.  All named executive officers participated in the 401(k) Plan during fiscal 2018 and received Company provided matching       contributions.  In addition, the Company also has a discretionary retirement contribution component to its 401(k) program in which the named executive officers are also eligible         to participate.  Under this component, a discretionary retirement contribution can be made to the participant's 401(k) Plan account.  This discretionary contribution ranges from 0-6% of an employee's eligible base calendar year earnings.  The         Company made a discretionary contribution of 6% in 2018 for all participants.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The Johnson Outdoors' Deferred Compensation Plan was amended and restated on September 18, 2007. The Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan       provides an opportunity for the named executive officers to defer a portion of their compensation and uses such deferral to encourage the continued loyalty and service of such persons to the Company.  Eligible participants of this plan are designated       by the Compensation Committee as Highly Compensated Employees (HCE) under the definition of the Internal Revenue Code as well as employees with designated titles, including executive, director, senior manager or employees whose positions are       recognized as key technical lead positions.  The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the Pension Committee to determine annual eligibility based upon the criteria noted above.  A participant's election shall specify the percentage (in       increments of one percent to a maximum of 13 percent) of the participant's base compensation.  Participants may also specify the percentage (in increments of one percent to a maximum of seven percent) of their cash bonus for deferral under the plan.        A participant who makes a bonus deferral under this plan may be entitled to a matching contribution credit, determined and credited following the conclusion of each plan year, equal to 50 percent of the first six percent of the participant's annual       bonus award that the participant elects to have contributed to his/her account as a bonus deferral.  Participants designate how his or her account shall be deemed to be invested among the investment options.  Each day that the U.S. financial markets       are open, the account of each participant will be credited (or charged) based upon the investment gain (or loss) that the participant would have realized with respect to his or her account since the immediately preceding valuation date had the       account been invested in accordance with the participant's investment election.  The named executive officers have made elections for distributions allowed by the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan upon separation from service.  The       distribution of the named participant's pre-2005 account, if applicable, would be made or commence on the first day of the month that is at least 60 days following the date the participant separates from service.  Named participants' post-2004       account distributions, if applicable, would commence on the first day of the month following the six month anniversary of the participant's separation from service.
Potential Payments/Benefits Upon Termination or Change of Control
Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation         Committee in its discretion may, at the time of an award or at any time thereafter, provide (1) for the immediate vesting of all outstanding stock options and shares of restricted stock upon a change of control of the Company or (2) that any         outstanding performance-based restricted stock units shall be deemed earned at the target grant amount.  The grant agreements for shares of restricted stock have generally provided for immediate vesting upon a change of control of the Company and         the grant agreements for performance-based restricted stock units have generally provided that 100% of the target grant is deemed earned upon a change of control of the Company. The following table sets forth the unvested stock options,       shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units held by the named executive officers as of September 28, 2018, that would become vested or earned as of such date in the event of a change of control of Johnson Outdoors.

(1)  The named executive officers held no unvested options at fiscal year-end.  Had they held                      unvested options at year end, unrealized value would equal the closing market value of the Class A common stock as of September 28, 2018, minus the exercise price, multiplied by the number of unvested shares of the Class A common stock                      as of such date.  The closing market value of the Class A common stock on September 28, 2018 was $92.99.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  With respect to shares of restricted stock, unrealized value equals the closing per share market value of the Class A common stock as of September 28, 2018,                    multiplied by the number of unvested shares of the Class A common stock as of such date.  With respect to unearned, outstanding performance-based restricted stock units, the number of restricted stock units included in the table above                    represent the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable at achievement of 100% of the target grant level (i.e., 35,779 and 6,916 shares for Ms. Johnson-Leipold and Mr. Johnson, respectively).  The unrealized value of such units                    equals the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the outstanding unearned restricted stock units at 100% of target grant multiplied by the closing per share market value of the Class A common stock as of September 28, 2018.                     The closing market value of the Class A common stock on September 28, 2018 was $92.99.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Johnson Outdoors seeks to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to serve on the Board of Directors.  To that end, the Company maintains a       philosophy of paying outside Directors fairly and consistently with respect to the external market.  Moreover, the Company adheres to a process for reviewing the market and considering revisions to its Director compensation program that is consistent       with good governance practices.
Each year, the Compensation Committee tasks its independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer, with reviewing the external market with respect       to Director compensation levels, mix, and practices among our peers and more broadly among public companies of similar size to Johnson Outdoors, including a review of the companies listed above under the section "Peer Group Benchmarking".  For the       latter perspective, Pearl Meyer makes use of the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD) annual survey of director compensation.  Generally, the Committee seeks to deliver an overall compensation package near the market median, with a       greater portion of compensation delivered in equity versus cash.  Based on this review, the Committee considers potential changes to the level of various compensation elements.
Page 38 of 44
Johnson Outdoors uses a combination of cash and stock-based compensation         to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board of Directors.  With respect to fiscal 2018 and based upon the recommendations of Pearl Meyer, the         outside directors received a $40,000 annual retainer and an annual equity award of restricted stock units having a grant date value of $70,000.  The equity award was increased from the prior year's level of $45,000, as the overall level of Director         compensation had fallen well below the market median, as determined by Pearl Meyer in connection with its comparative analysis noted above.  For fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance         Committee chairs received additional annual retainers of $15,000, $10,000 and $7,000, respectively.  Each director who is not an employee of Johnson Outdoors or one of its subsidiaries ("an outside director") is generally also entitled to receive $1,500        for each meeting of the Board of Directors or committee he or she attends (non-committee board members receive 75 percent of this amount when such individuals are asked to         attend a committee meeting).  The Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors receives an additional annual retainer of $40,000.
In connection with the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of         Directors and the Company's shareholders approved the Johnson Outdoors Inc. 2012 Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Plan. The plan provides that upon first being elected or appointed as one of the Company's directors, and thereafter on the first         business day after the annual meeting of shareholders, the Company has the option of granting equity awards to such persons containing a value determined by the Compensation Committee.  Equity awards may be granted under the plan in the form of         stock options, shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units.  For any award made under the Plan, the number of shares granted is based on the fair market value per share on the date of the award or, in the case of restricted stock units, at        the fair market value per share of the underlying Class A common stock on the date of the award.

(1)  The amounts in this column reflect the dollar value of long-term equity based compensation                      awards granted pursuant to our 2012 Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Plan during fiscal 2018.  These amounts equal the grant date fair value of shares                      of common stock in the case of an award of shares of restricted stock or the grant date fair value of the underlying shares of restricted stock in the case of an award of restricted stock units, computed in each case in accordance with                      FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718-10.  Assumptions used in                      the calculation of the grant date fair value are included under the caption "Stock Ownership Plans" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in the fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 7, 2018 and such information is incorporated herein by reference.

CEO PAY RELATIVE TO MEDIAN PAY OF OUR EMPLOYEES
The compensation for our CEO in fiscal 2018 ($2,659,701 as disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above) was approximately 50 to 1 times       to the annual "total compensation" as defined by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K of our median employee ($53,321).  Total compensation includes base salary, bonus compensation, equity awards and other perquisites and allowances.  Our CEO to median       employee ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and represents a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and guidance.  We identified the median employee by examining the annual wage and target       bonus amount reflected in our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on September 14, 2018.   We included all our global employees across eleven       countries, whether employed on a full-time, part time, temporary or seasonal basis.  After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers       as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Related Person Transactions
The Company purchases certain services primarily from S.C. Johnson &         Son, Inc. ("S.C. Johnson") and, to a lesser extent, from other organizations controlled by Johnson Family members (including Ms. Johnson-Leipold) and other related parties.  For example, the Company leases its headquarters facility from Johnson         Financial Group and S.C. Johnson provides the Company with (1) administrative services, conference facilities and transportation services, (2) information processing, and (3) from time to time, certain loaned employees.  The Company believes that         the amounts paid to these organizations are no greater than the fair market value of the services.  The total amount incurred by the Company for the foregoing services during fiscal 2018 was approximately $1,231,000.
Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions
The charter for the Audit Committee provides that it is responsible for the review and approval of related party transactions in accordance with       NASDAQ listing requirements.  Based upon the Audit Committee's review, the Company believes that all related person transactions described above were at arms-length and contained terms that were no less favorable than what could have been obtained       from an unaffiliated third party.  The Board of Directors has also adopted a formal written set of policies and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of related person transactions.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the         Company's executive officers, directors, and more than 10 percent shareholders to file with the SEC reports on prescribed forms of their beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of Company stock and furnish copies of such forms to         the Company.  Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company, or written representations that no Form 5 reports were required to be filed, the Company believes that during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 to date,       all reports required by Section 16(a) to be filed by the Company's officers, directors and more than 10 percent shareholders were filed on a timely basis, except Mr. David W. Johnson filed a Form 5 report on October 15, 2018 reporting four separate       Form 4 transactions occurring during Fiscal 2018.
  PROPOSAL 3:  NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE         COMPENSATION
The Proposal
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and SEC rules and regulations (and consistent with the similar proposal on executive compensation submitted to the Company's shareholders in connection with prior Annual Meetings of Shareholders), the       Company's Board of Directors has authorized a non-binding advisory shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as reflected in the section herein titled "Executive Compensation," the disclosures regarding       named executive officer compensation provided in the various tables included in this Proxy Statement, the accompanying narrative disclosures and the other executive compensation information provided in this Proxy Statement.  This proposal, commonly       known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives the Company's shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the Company's executive pay programs and policies.
Page 41 of 44
The Company believes its compensation policies and procedures align the executive officers' compensation with the Company's short-term and       long-term performance and provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who are important to the Company's continued success.  The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and approves the Company's       compensation policies and procedures, and periodically reviews its executive compensation programs and takes any steps it deems necessary to continue to fulfill the objectives of the Company's compensation programs.
Shareholders are encouraged to carefully review the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement for a detailed discussion of our       executive compensation programs.  These programs have been designed to promote a performance-based culture which aligns the interests of our named executive officers and other managers with the interests of the shareholders.  This includes annual       incentive cash compensation based on the named executive officers achieving their individual goals and objectives, together with incentive compensation based on the Company achieving specified financial performance measures.  A substantial portion of       our named executive officers' compensation is also based on equity awards with long-term vesting or performance-based requirements.
Highlights of the Company's compensation programs include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Neither of the named executive officers have any employment agreements with the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Company is not required to provide any severance or termination pay or benefits to any named executive officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The named executive officers are not entitled to any tax gross-up payments in connection with any Company compensation programs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Although the Company is a "Controlled Company," and is therefore exempt from certain independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market rules, including the                    requirement to maintain a Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors, each member of the Company's Compensation Committee is independent under the applicable standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Company's compensation focuses on performance, with base pay accounting for only 24%                          of total compensation opportunity for Ms. Johnson‑Leipold and 34% of total compensation opportunity for Mr. Johnson for fiscal 2018.  The remainder of their total compensation opportunity is comprised of cash incentive bonuses based on                    achieving individual goals and Company financial performance, and long‑term equity awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A substantial portion of the named executive officers' compensation consists of annual cash incentives based upon achieving specific goals and objectives under our                    Cash Bonus Plan.  In order for named executive officers to receive an annual incentive cash bonus, the Company must also meet an additional hurdle based on a minimum level of net income and return of profit to shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Company has a "clawback" or compensation recovery policy which provides for the recoupment of incentive compensation in the event of certain accounting                    restatements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Compensation Committee continually monitors Company performance and adjusts compensation practices accordingly.  For example, beginning with fiscal 2016, all                    the equity awards made to our CEO are based on achieving a specified level of financial performance for the Company.  Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee also modified the portion of the long-term equity incentive awards                    (i.e., the portion issued in the form of performance-based restricted stock units) that are linked to achieving Company performance goals to be based on a three-year performance period rather than a one year period, to better coincide                    with the Company's three year strategic plan; and  
[END TABLE]
Page 42 of 44
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Compensation Committee regularly assesses the Company's individual and total compensation programs against peer companies, the general marketplace and other                    industry data points and the Compensation Committee utilizes an independent consultant to engage in ongoing independent review of all aspects of our executive compensation programs.  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, shareholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to Johnson Outdoors' named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement       pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the compensation tables and narrative disclosures, is hereby approved by the shareholders of Johnson Outdoors Inc."
Because this shareholder vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board of Directors.  However, the Compensation Committee will take into       account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
Vote Required for Approval
If a quorum exists, the approval of the non-binding advisory proposal on our executive compensation described in this Proxy Statement requires the       votes cast, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, for this proposal to exceed the votes against this proposal.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count toward the determination of whether this proposal is approved and will have       no impact on the vote.
Board of Directors Recommendation
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the non-binding advisory resolution approving our executive compensation.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
All shareholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities         Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Rule 14a-8"), for presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received at the offices of the Company, Attention:  Corporate Secretary, 555 Main Street, Racine, Suite 342, Wisconsin       53403 by September 13, 2019 (120 days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of this Proxy Statement) for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the meeting.  In addition, a shareholder who otherwise (other than pursuant       to SEC Rule 14a-8) intends to present business at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws.  Among other things, to bring business before an annual meeting, a shareholder must give written notice thereof, complying with the Bylaws, to the Secretary of the Company not more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual         meeting and not less than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more         than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the         90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of         the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation.  Under the Bylaws, if the Company does not receive notice of a shareholder proposal submitted otherwise than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (namely, proposals shareholders intend to present       at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders but do not intend to have included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for such meeting) prior to the close of business on November 30, 2019, then the notice will be considered untimely and       the Company will not be required to present such proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  If the Board of Directors chooses to present such proposal at the 2020        Annual Meeting of Shareholders, then the persons named in the proxies solicited by the Board of Directors for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders may exercise discretionary         voting power with respect to such proposal.

OTHER MATTERS
The Company has filed an Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC for the         fiscal year ended September 28, 2018.  This Form 10-K will be mailed on or around January 11, 2019, to each person who is a record or beneficial holder of shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock on the record date for the       Annual Meeting.  Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the rules of the SEC, the Company, where allowed, is delivering only one copy of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and this Proxy Statement to multiple shareholders sharing an address       unless the Company has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders.  Upon written or oral request, the Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and/or this Proxy Statement to any shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered.  If you are a shareholder residing at a shared address and would like       to request an additional copy of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and/or this Proxy Statement now or with respect to future mailings (or to request to receive only         one copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement if you are currently receiving multiple copies), then you may notify the Company (1) by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Johnson Outdoors Inc., 555 Main Street, Suite 342, Racine, Wisconsin 53403         or (2) via email to: proxy@johnsonoutdoors.com.
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company.  The Company expects to solicit proxies primarily by mail.  Proxies may also be       solicited in person or by telephone by certain officers and employees of the Company.  It is not anticipated that anyone will be specially engaged to solicit proxies or that special compensation will be paid for that purpose.  The Company will also       reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and others for expenses incurred in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners of the Company's common stock.
Neither the Board of Directors nor management intends to bring before the Annual Meeting any matters other than those referred to in the Notice of       Annual Meeting and this Proxy Statement.  In the event that any other matters shall properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy forms to vote the shares represented by each such proxy in accordance       with their judgment on such matters.
