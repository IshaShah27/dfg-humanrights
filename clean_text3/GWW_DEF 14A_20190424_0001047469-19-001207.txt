      THE ROLE OF THE BOARD       
The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) acts as the steward of the Company for the benefit of the Company's shareholders. Our Directors bring to the Board a wealth of business experience and a track record of good business judgment in various situations relevant to the Company's operations. Our Directors exercise their business judgment in the best interests of the Company consistent with their fiduciary duties, and in alignment with shareholder value. 
Our Board recognizes the importance of ensuring that our overall business strategy is designed to create long-term value for Grainger's shareholders. The Board maintains an active role in formulating, planning and overseeing the implementation of Grainger's strategy. Each year, for example, the Board travels to one of our strategic operating locations. In 2018, the Board visited our Toronto distribution center, met with employees, and held its formal Board and Committee meetings at the headquarters of our Canadian business, Acklands—Grainger Inc. 
The Board has a robust annual strategic planning process during which key elements of our business and financial plans, strategies and near- and long-term initiatives are developed and reviewed. This process culminates with a full-day Board session with our senior leadership team to review Grainger's overall strategy, opportunities, challenges, and capabilities. The annual strategy process also helps shape the strategic content presented in our communications with the investment community. In addition to business strategy, the Board reviews Grainger's short-term and long-term financial plans, which serve as the basis for the annual operating and capital plans for the upcoming year. The Board evaluates progress made, as well as related challenges and risks, with respect to our strategy and plans throughout the year. 
      Operating Principles of the Board of Directors       
The Board recognizes that defining its role under the Company's operating principles is an evolving process. In 1995, the Board established the W.W. Grainger, Inc. Operating Principles for the Board of Directors (the Operating Principles). The Operating Principles are not intended to cover all issues that may arise, but rather to provide a general framework of reference to assist the Board in the performance of its duties and responsibilities. Each year, the Board reviews and revises the Operating Principles, as appropriate, to address emerging needs and practices. The Operating Principles are available in the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE  
Our Board of Directors is committed to excellence in its governance practices, including Board composition. Of our Board, 10 of 11 Directors are independent. The Board has adopted "categorical standards" to assist it in making independence determinations of Director nominees. The categorical standards are intended to help, for example, the Board determine whether certain relationships between nominees and Grainger are "material relationships" for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) independence standards. The categorical standards adopted by the Board have more restrictive thresholds than the NYSE's bright line revenue test for non-independence. The

[END TABLE]
 categorical standards adopted by the Board are set forth in Appendix A to this proxy statement and are also available in the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor. 
Grainger's Board has 10 independent Directors and one management Director. The Board considered a variety of factors, including related party transactions, in assessing the independence of the Directors against the NYSE's independence standards and Grainger's categorical standards. The Board considered ordinary course business transactions and charitable donations by the Company where a Director serves as an officer and/or a board member. The Board determined that no Director had any direct or indirect material interest in any transactions or donations. Similar transactions and donations are likely to occur in the future and are not expected to impair the independence of the Directors involved. Mr. Macpherson is a Grainger employee and, accordingly, is not considered "independent." However, the Board has determined that each of Mses. Hailey and Perez, and Messrs. Adkins, Anderson, Levenick, Novich, Roberts, Santi, Slavik, and Watson has no material relationship with Grainger within the meaning of the NYSE independence standards and Grainger's categorical standards and is, therefore, independent. 
      BOARD QUALIFICATIONS, ATTRIBUTES, SKILLS AND BACKGROUND       
In addition to independence, the Board and the Board Affairs and Nominating Committee (the BANC) believe that a diverse, experienced and vibrant board also is of utmost importance for the broad-based thinking needed to reach the sound decisions that drive shareholder value. As evidence of this commitment to a diversity of perspectives, our Board is currently comprised of 11 Directors of varying experience and background, including two new Directors appointed in 2017. 
We determined that the Board's various experiences and viewpoints benefit us most when they are aligned with our global business needs, reflective of our strong corporate governance practices, and consistent with our corporate social responsibility goals. As a result of the Board's ongoing refreshment efforts, we added Directors with expertise in the technology and digital space, as well as in leading corporate social responsibility initiatives for a global business. Our three newest Directors, Rodney Adkins, Beatriz Perez and Lucas Watson, have enhanced the diversity of our Board in addition to bringing their valuable perspectives and experiences. 
A breadth of Board perspectives supports our business as a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services with 2018 sales of $11.2 billion. Grainger operates through its distribution centers, eCommerce platform, contact centers, branches and sales and service representatives with approximately 24,600 employees primarily in the United States and Canada, and with a presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Approximately 5,200 suppliers provide Grainger with approximately 1.7 million products stocked in Grainger's distribution centers and branches worldwide. More than 3.5 million customers worldwide rely on Grainger for products such as safety, gloves, ladders, motors and janitorial supplies, along with services like inventory management and technical support. Grainger's purpose is to help businesses keep their operations running and their people safe.

      Board Refreshment       
The Board believes that a fully engaged Board is a strategic asset of the Company, and fresh viewpoints and perspectives are important for informed decision-making. At the same time, the Company believes that Directors develop a deeper understanding of the Company over time, which provides significant shareholder value, and that year-over-year Director continuity is beneficial to shareholders.

[END TABLE]
Even before Board vacancies arise, the Board periodically evaluates whether its Directors collectively have the right mix of experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, backgrounds and diverse viewpoints necessary for it to be a good steward for the Company's shareholders. The results of these evaluations are used to identify desirable skill sets for potential Board nominees and to screen Director candidates. In 2017, the Board codified this skills matrix evaluation practice into the BANC's charter. 
Also part of the planning for Board refreshment and Director succession, the BANC periodically considers potential Director candidates. As a result of these ongoing reviews, in the last five years, the Board appointed four new Directors. 
The Board previously disclosed its membership expectations in the Company's Criteria for Membership on the Board of Directors (the Criteria). The Board's Criteria list the various factors that the BANC should consider in reviewing candidates for the Board. For example, the Criteria insures turnover by generally prescribing a retirement age of 72 for non-employee Director candidates. Within the last three years, two of our Directors did not stand for re-election based on retirement age.

      Board Tenure       
The Board believes that it has the appropriate mix of relatively new Directors and those with longer service to and financial interest in the Company. One longstanding Director, Mr. Slavik, is the beneficial owner of approximately 6.5% of the Company's shares as of March 4, 2019. Mr. Slavik's beneficial ownership of Company shares pre-dates Grainger's initial public offering in 1967. 
As a group, the average tenure of the 2019 nominees for election to Grainger's Board of Directors is approximately 12 years, with 30% of the non-employee nominees having Board tenure of less than five years. See Board Qualifications, Attributes, Skills and Background / page 2-4 of this proxy statement for a matrix reflecting tenure for each nominee.

      Board Diversity       
In addition to relevant business experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, and the willingness to become involved with Grainger, the Board's Criteria also enumerate personal characteristics that the Board should consider, including reputation for ethics and integrity, common sense and judgment, independent and objective thought, and the consideration of diverse opinions. 
Regarding diversity, the Criteria specify that consideration will be given to candidates without regard to race, color, religion, gender or national origin. To ensure that the Board benefits from diverse perspectives, it proactively seeks qualified nominees from a variety of backgrounds, including candidates of gender, age, and racial diversity. We have established a standing relationship with a nationally recognized third party search firm to assist us in identifying potential new Directors. In any retained search for Board candidates, the Board is seeking candidates with gender and racial diversity and will only consider and interview slates that include gender and racially diverse candidates.

ANNUAL ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  
Grainger's Directors are elected each year at the annual meeting of shareholders. As set forth in the Operating Principles for the Board of Directors, Grainger expects all Directors and nominees to attend annual meetings. At the 2018 annual meeting, all of the persons serving as Directors at the time were in attendance. In addition, during 2018, all Directors attended 100% of Board and Committee meetings. 
Eleven Directors, all current Board members, have been nominated by the Board for election at this year's annual meeting of shareholders. All Directors are elected for a one-year term. Each Director will, therefore, serve until the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. 
As required under Illinois law, majority voting and cumulative voting apply to all Grainger Director elections. Under our majority voting standard, Directors are elected by the votes of a majority of the shares of Grainger common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Under cumulative voting, shareholders have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of Directors. This means that you have a number of votes in the election equal to the number of shares you own multiplied by the number of Directors being elected. You can cast those votes for the nominees as you choose. For example, you may cast all your votes for one nominee or you may apportion your votes among two or more nominees. In any matter other than the election of Directors, each of your shares is entitled to one vote. 
A shareholder directing to withhold authority for re-election of a Director will have the same effect as votes against the election of that Director. Assuming a quorum is present, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote. If any of the nominees for Director mentioned below should be unavailable for election, a circumstance that is not expected, the person or persons voting your proxy may exercise discretion to vote for a substitute nominee selected by the Board. 
      CANDIDATES FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP       
The Board Affairs and Nominating Committee (the Committee) recommends to the Board candidates for Board and Committee membership. 
Before recommending candidates to the Board, the Committee reviews the results of the annual Board evaluation process and its skills matrix in determining the desired skill set for potential new candidates. The Committee then determines the preferred qualities and characteristics for potential Board nominees, which is then shared with our third party search firm, by periodically evaluating whether the Board members collectively have the right mix of experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, backgrounds and diverse viewpoints necessary for the Board to be a good steward for the Company's shareholders.

[END TABLE]
The Committee screens Board candidates based on a number of criteria, including ethical standards, judgment, independence and objectivity, strategic perspective, record of accomplishment, business knowledge, experience applicable to Grainger's goals, and diversity. 
The Committee is assisted with its recruitment efforts by a nationally recognized third party search firm, which helps identify candidates that satisfy the Board's criteria. In addition to Board candidates recommended by the Committee, suggestions as to nominees are received from employees, search firms, shareholders, and others. 
The proxy access provisions of our By-laws permit a qualifying shareholder or group of up to 20 qualifying shareholders who have maintained continuous qualifying ownership of 3% or more of our outstanding common stock for at least the previous three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials qualifying Director nominees constituting up to the greater of two Directors or 20% of the Directors then serving on the Board at the time of the nomination, presuming that the shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our By-laws. 
Any shareholder who would like the Committee to consider a candidate for Board membership should send a letter of recommendation containing the name and address of the proposing shareholder and of the proposed candidate and setting forth the business, professional, and educational background of the proposed candidate, as well as a description of any agreement or relationship between the proposing shareholder and proposed candidate. A written consent of the proposed candidate to be identified as a nominee and to serve as a Director if elected must also be provided. The communication should be sent by mail or other delivery service to the attention of the Corporate Secretary at Grainger's headquarters. 
NOMINEES AND DIRECTOR EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS  
The nominees have provided the following information about themselves, including their ages as of March 14, 2019. Each nominee has provided information on his or her relevant background that includes the nominee's experience for at least the past five years. Grainger's nominees have varied experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, and backgrounds that assist them in providing guidance and oversight to Grainger's management. 
The Board has identified experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, and backgrounds that, in light of Grainger's business, structure and challenges, are relevant to service on the Board of Directors. The Board considers nominees who have demonstrated integrity and accomplishment in their business and professional careers and who possess the necessary experience and background to contribute to the Board and Grainger. In addition, the nominees have engaged in continuing education and other

programs to remain current in their particular areas of expertise, to further their understanding of corporate governance, and in other matters relevant to Grainger. 
The Board believes each of the current nominees qualifies for service on the Board of Directors. Moreover, each of the current nominees has significant leadership experience in large, multifaceted organizations. This leadership experience includes developing and executing corporate strategy, overseeing operations, and managing risks in organizations similar in size or complexity to Grainger. 
The summaries, provided below, are not a comprehensive statement of each nominee's background, but are provided to describe the primary experience, qualifications, attributes, skills, and background that led the Board to nominate each individual.

      BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP       
The Company's Operating Principles for the Board of Directors (the Operating Principles) provide for the Board's Committees and the process for selecting Committee leadership. The BANC's recommendations are considered by the Board following each annual meeting of shareholders. The Committees are appointed by the Board based on recommendations of the BANC. As required by each Committee's charter, all members of each Committee must be "independent" Directors. 
Five meetings of the Board were held in 2018. Committee members have the opportunity to meet in closed session, without management present, during each Committee meeting. Accordingly, each Board meeting included at least one executive session, during which only independent Directors were present. The Committees report regularly to the full Board on their activities and actions. 
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities and authority to its standing Committees, as described below. 
    Independent Directors' Committee Assignments         
 Chairperson      Member      Lead Director  
Each Committee has a charter that it reviews annually and then makes recommendations to our Board for charter revisions that may be needed to reflect evolving best practices.  Copies of each Committee charter are available in the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee) met five times in 2018. The Board has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is "independent," as that term is defined in the independence requirements for audit committee members contained in the applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and in the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is financially literate and that each of Ms. Hailey, Mr. Anderson, Mr. Novich, and Mr. Santi is an "audit committee financial expert," as that term is defined in the applicable rules of the SEC. Further, in accordance with applicable NYSE listing standards, the Board has considered Mr. Anderson's simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than three public companies, namely the audit committees of Grainger, PulteGroup Inc., James Hardie Industries plc, and Stericycle, Inc., and has determined that this service will not impair his ability to serve effectively on the Company's Audit Committee.

LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE  
The Board has strong governance structures and processes in place to ensure the independence of the Board. These structures and processes, which are reflected in the Operating Principles for the Board of Directors (the Operating Principles) and the Committee charters, allow for the independent Directors to effectively exercise the Board's authority in overseeing critical matters of strategy, operations, enterprise risk management, and financial reporting. 
The Board carefully considered its leadership structure and believes that a combined Chairman/CEO position represents the best long-term leadership structure for Grainger. In the Board's view, having a single individual serving as both the Chairman and CEO assists in the timely flow of relevant information, which supports effective Board decision-making and provides a useful connection between the Board and management so that Board actions are appropriately and efficiently executed. The Board's Lead Director structure helps assure these functions are properly and timely performed. The Board does not believe that separating the role of the Chairman and CEO would result in strengthening Grainger's corporate governance or in creating or enhancing long-term value for our shareholders. 
The duties performed by the independent Directors, either collectively or through Committees comprised solely of independent Directors, include selecting the Chairman and CEO and evaluating his or her performance, and setting his or her compensation. In deciding that a combined Chairman and CEO position is the appropriate long-term leadership structure for Grainger, the Board also recognizes the need for independent leadership and oversight. Since 1995, the Operating Principles provide for a leadership role to the independent Director serving as Chair of the BANC. Over time, this Lead Director has been responsible for facilitating Board involvement on major issues and/or proposals, reviewing meeting agenda and information to be provided to the Board, consulting with Directors, the CEO and management, and presiding at executive sessions of the Board. 
The Board believes that given Grainger's corporate governance structures and processes, a combined Chairman and CEO position in conjunction with an independent Lead Director provides effective oversight of management by the Board and results in a high level of management accountability to shareholders. 
LEAD DIRECTOR  
In 2010, the Board revised its Operating Principles and Grainger's By-laws to create the leadership position of Lead Director, to be elected by and from the Board's independent Directors. The current Lead Director, Mr. Stuart L. Levenick, was appointed to serve in this capacity after the April 2014 annual meeting of shareholders. Among the duties assigned to the Lead Director is the responsibility for:

BOARD, COMMITTEE AND DIRECTOR EVALUATIONS  
The Board recognizes that a rigorous evaluation process is an essential component of strong corporate governance practices and promoting ongoing Board effectiveness. Each year, the Board conducts a three-part evaluation process coordinated by the Lead Director and the Committee Chairs: full Board evaluation, Committee evaluations, and Director self-assessment. These evaluations, which are annually reviewed by an external corporate governance expert, ask Directors to rate how the Board performs and seek feedback on more open-ended topics, including Board and Committee processes and effectiveness, including for example:

[END TABLE]
The results of the evaluations are compiled anonymously and include responses and comments. The results of the completed Board evaluations and individual Director self-assessments are furnished to the Lead Director, while the results of the completed evaluations for the Committees are furnished to the corresponding Committee Chairs, and then discussed at the Board and Committee meetings, respectively. Below is an overview of the key steps in the annual evaluation process: 
    Annual Board, Committee and Director Evaluation Process         
The information gained through this process helps shape the content of educational presentations to the Board and identify the skill sets desirable in Director searches conducted from time-to-time by the Board. 
As a result of the Board's 2018 evaluation process, the Board identified the need for Director education opportunities in digital marketing. Accordingly, later in 2018, all Directors participated in a half-day digital marketing seminar, led by two marketing professors from Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

BOARD OVERSIGHT  
The Board oversees its management to, among other things, encourage management communication with our shareholders, ensure effective succession planning to maximize long-term corporate performance, evaluate management's performance against its goals, help management assess long-term strategies for, and oversee risk management processes and policies of, the Company, and to evaluate the Company's commitment to social responsibility. 
Board's Role in Shareholder Engagement  
The Board believes it is important that the Company's strategy is effectively communicated to its shareholders, and that shareholders' perspectives are understood and considered by the Board. During 2017 and 2018, the Board's Lead Director met with a variety of institutional investors to explain the Company's corporate governance practices and policies as part of a corporate governance roadshow. 
As part of its oversight role, the Board routinely receives reports and briefings from the Company's Investor Relations team. Grainger has a comprehensive shareholder engagement program. During 2018, we engaged with a significant cross-section of our shareholder base, including large institutional investors, pension funds, and other investors. Our CEO, CFO and VP of Investor Relations, and other members of our Investor Relations team, maintain regular contact throughout the year with a broad base of shareholders to understand their concerns on various topics, including financial performance, strategy, competitive environment, and environmental, social and governance matters. Contact with shareholders includes quarterly earnings calls, individual meetings and other channels of communication. In 2018, we engaged with institutional shareholders representing more than 30% of our outstanding shares. Throughout the shareholder engagement in 2018, the Board routinely received updates from the Company's Vice President, Investor Relations, regarding shareholder concerns, trends, and various questions. 
We will continue to engage with our shareholders on a regular basis to understand their perspectives and, as appropriate, incorporate their feedback on our performance, business strategies, executive compensation programs and corporate governance practices. 
Succession Planning and Management Development  
Our Board recognizes that it has an important duty to ensure senior leadership continuity by overseeing the development of executive talent and planning for the efficient succession of the CEO and other key leadership positions. Our Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for succession planning and management development to the BANC. The Committee reports on its activities to the full Board, which routinely addresses succession planning during executive sessions. 
Our Board generally conducts, at least once a year, an in-depth review of senior leader development and succession planning, including emergency succession scenarios. This review addresses the Company's management development initiatives, assesses senior management resources, and identifies individuals who should be considered as potential future senior executives. To ensure that the succession planning and management development process supports and enhances Grainger's strategic objectives, the Board and the BANC also regularly consult with the Chairman of the Board and CEO on the Company's organizational needs, the leadership potential and related development plans for key managers, and plans for future development and emergency situations.

Board's Role in Risk Oversight  
The Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight. Its role is to oversee risk assessment and risk management processes and policies used by Grainger to identify, assess, monitor and address potential financial, compensation, operational, strategic and legal risks on an enterprise-wide basis. In addition, the risks monitored include threats to information technology systems and other issues of cyber security as part of our overall Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) initiatives. As part of these initiatives, the Board oversees and reviews the Company's processes for cybersecurity risk, including the Company's framework for detecting, mitigating and addressing cybersecurity incidents. 
Both the Board and the Audit Committee regularly review Grainger's risk assessment and risk management processes and policies, including receiving regular reports from the Company's Chief Information Security Officer, and the members of Grainger's management who are responsible for risk assessment and risk management on the effectiveness of Grainger's ERM initiatives. As part of its oversight responsibility, the Compensation Committee assesses the relationship between potential risk created by Grainger's compensation programs and their impact on long-term shareholder value. 
Corporate Social Responsibility  
Grainger is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and strives to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles into the daily operation of its business. Grainger's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform includes our commitment to operating responsibly, valuing our people, serving our communities and sustaining our environment. These commitments shape our focus on corporate citizenship and fuel our determination to make a positive difference today and in the future. 
We integrate citizenship initiatives into the Company's strategy and daily operations at each level of our business. This begins with oversight by the BANC. The BANC annually reviews the Company's promotion of environmental sustainability and community engagement. In addition, the BANC receives routine reports and updates on ESG matters. In 2017, the Board appointed a new Director with expertise in sustainability. The Company's CSR Advisory Council, led by a senior executive and comprised of a select group of senior-level team members, provides guidance, strategic awareness and counsel to the Company's CSR program. Also, the Company has a cross-functional CSR Working Group that implements day-to-day programs and drives progress toward the success of our roadmap. 
The Company began reporting with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Standards in 2016 and, since 2017, has been a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2018, the Company met its emissions reduction target two years early. 
Grainger publishes an annual CSR report that is periodically updated and, while it is available on Grainger's website at  http://www.GraingerCSR.com, it is not being incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION  
Grainger's non-employee Directors each receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000 and an annual deferred stock grant of $145,000. The Lead Director and Directors serving as Committee Chairs receive an additional annual cash retainer.
Grainger's non-employee Directors are compensated at a level that approximates median market practice. In benchmarking Director pay, Grainger uses the same compensation comparator group that is used to benchmark compensation for Grainger's executives as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis / page 39. The Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant periodically reviews and updates the comparator group as well as comparative compensation information and advises on Director compensation. 
The Directors' compensation program, which was last adjusted in April 2018, consists of the following: 
All non-employee Directors receive an annual deferred stock unit grant worth $145,000. In 2018, the number of shares covered by each grant was equal to $145,000 divided by the 200-day average stock price through January 31 (a methodology consistent with the calculation used for equity awards to grant-eligible employees), rounded up to the next whole share. Beginning with the 2019 equity grants, Grainger will adjust this methodology for both Directors and grant-eligible employees from a 200-day average to a 20-day average to better reflect market practice. The deferred stock units are settled in shares upon termination of service as a Director. Directors may defer their annual cash retainers, Lead Director retainer, Committee Chair retainers (as applicable), and meeting fees into a deferred stock unit account. 
Stock ownership guidelines applicable to non-employee Directors were established in 1998. These guidelines provide that within five years after election, a Director must own Grainger common stock and common stock equivalents having a value of at least five times the annual cash retainer fee for serving on the Board. The hedging or pledging of Company shares by Directors or executive officers is prohibited by Company policy (see Hedging and Pledging Prohibition / page 56). No Directors (or executive officers) have hedged or pledged any of the shares beneficially owned by them and all Directors are currently in compliance with the ownership guidelines. 
Grainger matches Directors' charitable contributions on a three-to-one basis up to a maximum Company contribution of $7,500 annually and provides discounts on product purchases, both on the same basis as provided to U.S. Grainger employees. 
Mr. Macpherson, who is an employee of Grainger, does not receive any compensation for serving as a Director.

Security Ownership of Management  
The table below shows the ownership of Grainger common stock as of March 4, 2019, by our Directors, named executive officers, and all of our Directors and executive officers as a group. 
Beneficial ownership is broadly defined by the SEC. In general, a person beneficially owns securities if the person, alone or with another, has voting power or investment power (the power to sell) over the securities. Being able to acquire either voting or investment power within 60 days, such as by exercising stock options, also results in beneficial ownership of securities. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes following the table, each of the named persons had sole voting and investment power with respect to the indicated number of Grainger shares.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE  
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our Directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE, and to furnish us with copies of the reports. Specific due dates for these reports are prescribed by SEC rules and we are required to report in this proxy statement any failure by Directors, officers, or 10% holders to file such reports on a timely basis. Based on our review of such reports and written representations from our Directors and officers, we believe that all such filing requirements were timely met during 2018.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Board has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is "independent," as that term is defined in the independence requirements for audit committee members contained in the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Audit Committee acts under a charter that is reviewed annually; and, it was last amended by the Board on December 12, 2018. The charter is available on the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor. 
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process and for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Ernst & Young LLP (EY), the Company's independent auditor, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's most recent consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In performing these responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting with management and EY. The Audit Committee discussed with EY matters required to be discussed under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301 "Communications with Audit Committees" adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). EY also provided to the Audit Committee the letter and written disclosures required by PCAOB standards concerning EY's independence and the Audit Committee discussed with EY the matter of the firm's independence. 
Based on the review and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC.

      Pre-Approval Policy for Audit and Non-Audit Services       
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided to Grainger by its independent auditor and is responsible for the review and approval of any fees associated with those services. Also, specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee is required for any proposed services exceeding pre-approved fee levels. 
Pre-approvals for categories of services are granted at the start of each fiscal year and are applicable for 12 months from the date of pre-approval. In considering these pre-approvals, the Audit Committee reviews detailed supporting documentation from the independent auditor for each proposed service to be provided. Unused pre-approval amounts are not carried forward to the next year. 
The Company's Controller monitors services provided by the independent auditor and overall compliance with the pre-approval policy. The Corporate Controller reports periodically to the Audit Committee about the status of outstanding engagements, including actual services provided and associated fees, and must promptly report any noncompliance with the pre-approval policy to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority for audit and non-audit services to one or more of its members, and such authority has been delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee. The decisions of any member to whom such authority is delegated must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee may not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the Company's independent auditor. The Audit Committee periodically reviews reports summarizing all services provided by the independent auditor.

EY has been retained as the Company's independent auditor continuously since 2005. To ensure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee ensures that the mandated rotation of EY's personnel occurs routinely and the Audit Committee is directly involved in the review, selection and evaluation of EY's lead engagement partner. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of EY to serve as the Company's independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and the Board is asking shareholders to ratify this appointment. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the meeting to respond to appropriate questions of shareholders and to make any desired statements. 
Approval of the proposal requires the affirmative votes of a majority of the shares of Grainger common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal. In the event the proposal is not approved, the Board will consider the negative vote as a mandate to appoint another independent auditor for the next year.

      INTRODUCTION       
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes the Company's compensation philosophy and programs generally, and explains the compensation paid to the most highly compensated executives in 2018—the Named Executive Officers (NEOs). 
    Named Executive Officers (NEOs) for 2018         
The titles in the table above reflect positions held by the NEOs as of the end of 2018, and remain unchanged as of the date of this proxy statement.

Several leadership transitions took place during 2018, including:
      Executive Summary       
The Company's compensation program is based upon a philosophy that is applied to all Company employees—to attract and retain the best people and provide them appropriate performance-based incentives that encourage them to achieve results that create long-term shareholder value.
The Company's overall compensation structure is designed to drive profitable growth leading to shareholder value creation. Employees at all levels of the Company, including its executives, are

provided incentives to grow the business (Sales Growth) while achieving attractive investment returns (Return on Invested Capital, or ROIC) for the Company's shareholders. For executives, the compensation program is designed to link pay to performance and is structured to reward both annual and long-term Company performance while not encouraging excessive risk taking. 
Pay for performance highlights for 2018 include:
A key difference in 2018 to the Company's compensation plan design and administration was the Company's change to the long-term incentive mix for awards to 50% stock options and 50% performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) (from 50% stock options and 50% performance shares). This change occurred in response to market practice and to provide appropriate incentives to drive shareholder value creation. 
In 2018, NEO compensation mix did not change, as it includes a combination of base salary, short-term incentives, long-term equity incentives including PRSUs and stock options, and a performance-based retirement vehicle. These components are combined to provide Company executives with appropriate incentives for profitable long-term growth. 
The Company's NEO compensation is comprised of the following components:

Target total compensation for the Company's employees is generally set to approximate the market median. The weighting of the individual compensation components varies by level, with more senior level executives having a greater emphasis on performance-based long-term compensation—which aligns management to shareholders. As shown in the table below, NEO compensation is structured so that the largest component is long-term equity (stock options and PRSUs), followed by base salary and the performance-based annual incentives. Each NEO's compensation is compared to equivalent positions in a comparator group selected by the Compensation Committee (with assistance from the Committee's independent compensation consultant). NEO base salaries and long-term incentive grants are determined based on many factors including individual performance, responsibilities, and the overall relation to market levels of compensation. 
These components and the use of performance-based pay are consistent with the compensation mix of the comparator group. The tables below show compensation components as a percentage of the total target compensation package.

"2018 Adjusted ROIC" means the Company's Return on Invested Capital calculated using operating earnings, adjusted (as reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in Part II, Item 7 (p. 20) of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), divided by net working assets (a 5-point average for the year-to-date). Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal Total assets less cash equivalents (part of Cash and cash equivalents; 5-point average of $173.6 million), LIFO reserves (part of Inventories—net; 5-point average of $386.7 million), Deferred income taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities (part of Other assets). Working liabilities equal Total current liabilities less Short-term debt, Current maturities of long-term debt and Income taxes payable. For purposes of the 2018 MIP payout, the Compensation Committee has accepted the Company's calculation of 2018 Adjusted ROIC. 
"Annual Compensation" consists of base salary and the annual incentive plan as described further under "Annual Incentives." 
"Fixed/Individual Based Compensation" consists of base salary as described further under "Base Salaries." 
"Long-term Compensation" consists of stock options, PRSUs, and retirement profit sharing. Annual retirement profit sharing contributions are based on the Company's short-term performance; distributions are restricted, with full vesting of contributions once a participant has achieved five years of service with the Company as described further under "Long-Term Incentives" and "Other Benefits." 
"Peers" are the comparator group in the 2018 Deloitte Consulting Compensation Study as described further under "Compensation Comparator Group." 
"Performance Based Compensation" consists of the annual incentive plan, long-term incentives, and retirement profit sharing as described further under "Annual Incentives" and "Long-Term Incentives." 
The Company's compensation structure links pay with Company performance. Our 2018 financial results exceeded expectations and therefore the annual bonus payment was above target. The Company's long-term plan, established in 2016, met the target results for three year ROIC and therefore payout approximated target for this program.

The Company is focused on profitable daily sales growth over the short- and long-term. The Company believes that using capital efficiency (ROIC) and revenue (sales growth) is appropriate because the metrics are tied to shareholder values in both the short-term and long-term:
As a result, the Company believes that ROIC and sales growth are appropriate metrics and do not create unreasonable risk. 
Compensation Philosophy, Plans, and Practices  
As part of the Company's pay for performance philosophy, the Company's compensation program includes several features that maintain alignment with shareholders:

The Company's compensation programs also maintain alignment with shareholders by not including certain features:
Overall, the Company's compensation program is designed to be straightforward and understandable to its employees and shareholders, and to drive long-term shareholder value creation by aligning compensation with both individual and Company performance. 
      Compensation Committee of the Board       
The Compensation Committee of the Board is responsible for the Company's compensation programs.
The Compensation Committee oversees the Company's compensation and benefit programs for all officers and employees. The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the Company's compensation practices provide appropriate incentives to increase long-term shareholder value, reflect the highest level of integrity, and protect the interests of shareholders. One of its responsibilities is to make certain that a competitive compensation structure is in place that will attract, reward, and retain employees and to motivate them to grow the business profitably. The Committee is also charged with ensuring that compensation, especially for executives, is linked to both individual and Company performance, and ensuring that compensation policies and practices for all employees do not include incentives to take inappropriate risk. 
In setting individual compensation levels, the Compensation Committee selects a compensation comparator group of companies and reviews studies of total compensation paid to executives in those comparator group companies with similar duties and responsibilities. The Committee then considers a variety of reference points, including competitive compensation data at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, individual and Company performance, the executive's overall experience, replaceability, internal equity, unique skills, and management's recommendation to determine appropriate compensation for each executive. All elements of compensation are valued and reviewed in

evaluating the relative competitiveness of the Company's compensation practices against the comparator group. Target total compensation for the Company's employees and executives as a whole (including the NEOs) is generally set to approximate the market median. 
The Compensation Committee reviews at least annually a tally sheet for each NEO to evaluate the potential value of all compensation. The tally sheet includes each NEO's current base salary, annual incentive award, and the value of all outstanding equity-based awards (both vested and unvested), deferrals, benefits, and perquisites, as well as potential payments under retirement and certain change in control situations. Since no NEO has an employment agreement with the Company that guarantees continued employment, the tally sheets also facilitate the Committee's evaluation of vested and unvested awards and the retention value of these awards. 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee makes executive compensation decisions and recommends actions to the Board of Directors and to shareholders (for example, related to the advisory Say on Pay vote or equity plan proposals), as appropriate. 
In discharging its responsibilities, the Committee regularly consults with independent advisors, compensation consultants, and the Company's management. After a review of the factors prescribed by the SEC and the NYSE, the Compensation Committee determined that its compensation consultant, Deloitte Consulting, is an independent advisor under the applicable rules and regulations.  The Compensation Committee's charter is available in the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor.

      Risk Assessment       
The Compensation Committee's oversight responsibility includes assessing the relationship between potential risk created by the Company's compensation programs and their impact on long-term shareholder value. The Company's compensation programs are designed to include risk-mitigating features, and the Committee also engaged its independent compensation consultant (Deloitte Consulting) to assist with the process of an annual internal risk assessment of all incentive-based compensation, including short-term and long-term incentive programs.
The incentive compensation programs include risk-mitigating components, such as:
Since 2009, the Committee has engaged its independent compensation consultant, Deloitte Consulting, to conduct a risk assessment that is completed every three years. Deloitte Consulting conducted the Company's most recent triennial risk assessment in 2018 and the results were discussed with the Committee. For the interim years, the Company will conduct an annual internal risk review based on practices and methodologies recommended by the Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
Based on the risk review and the Committee's discussions, the Committee does not believe that the Company's compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
      Say on Pay       
At the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, the annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs received the support of 97% of the shareholders voting on the proposal. The Compensation Committee has considered these results and believes that they confirm the appropriateness of the Company's current executive compensation policies and practices. The Company routinely discusses its compensation philosophy with its shareholders as part of investor relations activities. 
The Company is required to seek shareholder vote on the frequency of the advisory Say on Pay vote every six years. In 2011 and 2017, management recommended an annual advisory Say on Pay vote. The next advisory frequency vote is scheduled for 2023.

      Role of Management       
Management assists the Compensation Committee in the design, recommendation, and implementation of compensation programs.
Members of management assist the Compensation Committee by routinely recommending programs that management believes will provide the appropriate level of compensation and incentives consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy. Consistent with this process, management works with advisors from Deloitte Consulting to develop market information and recommends adjustments in base salaries, annual incentive targets, and long-term incentive awards to be reviewed by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board. For NEOs other than Mr. Macpherson, the recommendations also include the structure and targets of short-term and long-term incentive programs, as well as changes to programs required for regulatory compliance. These recommendations are reviewed and approved by the Chairman of the Board and CEO before they are presented to the Compensation Committee. Mr. Macpherson's compensation is reviewed by the Compensation Committee in conjunction with its independent compensation consultant, together with other independent Directors (as directed by the Board), in executive session without members of management present. 
      Compensation Comparator Group       
The Company's compensation program is regularly benchmarked against a Compensation Committee-approved comparator group of companies that are similar to the Company in size and complexity. The Company performs these studies to understand current market practices and to provide a reference point for compensation discussions.
Every year, the Compensation Committee determines a compensation comparator group of companies and undertakes a study of total compensation paid to executives occupying similar positions with similar duties and responsibilities in the comparator companies. All elements of compensation are valued and considered when determining the relative competitiveness of the Company's compensation practices. A comparator group compensation study was conducted in 2018 (2018 Compensation Study). 
The 2018 comparator group consists of 19 businesses that are relatively similar in complexity and size to the Company and represent the types of major companies with which the Company historically competes for executive talent. The companies that were selected for the 2018 Compensation Study are generally within a range of 0.5 to 2.0 times Grainger's annual revenue. The competitive market for executive talent includes companies both within and outside the same industry or sector as the Company. Most of the Company's publicly traded direct competitors tend to be too small in sales or scope of operations for direct compensation comparisons with the Company. Including a broader range of companies provides a more representative depiction of the Company's competitive market for talent. Therefore, companies used for compensation comparison purposes differ from those in the industry indices used in the Company Performance Graph in Part II, Item 5 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Committee relied on its independent compensation consultant, Deloitte Consulting, for survey and market data. The role of management in selecting the comparator group was limited to providing general comments on the relevance of each industry represented by the comparator companies.

The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the comparator group and considered the findings of the 2018 Compensation Study in conjunction with a tally sheet listing the potential value of all compensation available for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee concluded that the NEOs' earned and potential awards for 2018 were consistent with the Company's pay philosophy, Company and individual performance, and market practices (as reflected in the 2018 Compensation Study). Based on this review and the strong support from shareholders on the Say on Pay proposal, the Committee

did not make material adjustments to the design of the Company's compensation programs. The next Compensation Study and comparator group validation is scheduled to take place in 2019. 
      Base Salaries       
Base salaries are intended to provide an appropriate level of fixed compensation to attract and retain executives. Base salaries are determined after a detailed evaluation of individual performance, competitive market levels, and executive experience.
Annual base salary adjustments are considered and implemented to reflect individual performance, contribution and experience, and to maintain market competitiveness. The 2018 Compensation Study showed that, on average, the Company's base salaries for NEOs were approximately 14% above the market median. 
Base salary increases for the NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Macpherson, are reviewed and approved by the Chairman of the Board and CEO before they are presented to the Compensation Committee for review and recommendation to the Board. The Committee reviews these recommendations in conjunction with its independent compensation consultant. 
The compensation awarded to Mr. Macpherson was determined by the Board with assistance from the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives relevant to Mr. Macpherson's compensation and evaluates each individual's performance in light of those goals and objectives. Together with the other independent Directors (as directed by the Board),the Compensation Committee determined and approved Mr. Macpherson's compensation level based on this evaluation, in executive session without members of management present. 
Following the annual performance management review process (which is similar to the process in which all employees participate), base salaries are reviewed and adjusted (if appropriate) to reflect individual and Company performance, base salaries for comparable positions from market studies, experience, tenure, fairness and internal equity. 
Based on the process outlined above, on April 1, 2018, Mr. Macpherson's base salary remained flat at $1,030,000 (+0.0%). 
The following base salary adjustments were made for the other NEOs effective April 1, 2018:

      Annual Incentives       
Annual incentives are intended to provide an appropriate level of variable compensation to encourage executives to achieve annual results that create shareholder value without encouraging excessive risk taking.
NEOs are eligible to receive short-term cash-based incentives on the achievement of specified annual Company-wide financial performance measures set forth in the Company Management Incentive Program (MIP). The Company structures the MIP to motivate performance that balances short-term and long-term results and aligns the interests of management with shareholders. 
Each NEO's target incentive award under the annual incentive program is based on a review of competitive market practice and is designed to approximate a market value that is generally at the median of the comparator group. The following table displays the 2018 MIP target payment, which is paid based on total Company results, applicable to each NEO. 
The Compensation Committee and management perform a thorough analysis in setting financial measures and goals for the Company MIP to ensure the program appropriately balances the Company's objectives, is aligned with long-term shareholder interest, and has appropriate and effective risk-mitigating components. While the measures and goals are clearly aligned with the Company's strategy, they also account for current economic conditions. The combination of sales growth and

[END TABLE]
ROIC performance, as well as threshold, target, and maximum payment levels, serves to mitigate risk to the Company's shareholders. 
The Company believes the design of the annual incentive program creates shareholder value and encourages performance by focusing on profitable sales growth and ROIC. The basic framework of the MIP has been in place for more than ten years, although specific objectives and performance target levels have been modified on a year-by-year basis in light of the current economic and competitive environment. This framework was selected to align with Company strategy and to balance sales growth with profitability, efficiency, expense management, and asset management. ROIC reflects how effectively management uses Company assets and is generally defined by the Company as pre-tax operating earnings divided by net working assets. Year-over-year daily sales growth is determined by year-over-year results. Acquisitions and divestitures that occur during the year are not included in the calculation of daily sales growth or ROIC. These measures are consistent with the Company's objective of growing profitably over time, which it believes is closely linked with shareholder value creation. 
The 2018 Company MIP was based on the Company's 2018 Adjusted ROIC and year-over-year daily sales growth. The Company determined the payment earned for ROIC and the payment earned for sales growth, and the two amounts were added together: 
    MIP Payment = (Sales Growth Performance + ROIC Performance)         
The following table shows various payout scenarios that were established at the beginning of the year for 2018: 
The Company believes that it establishes sales growth and ROIC targets that are rigorous and provide an appropriate level of motivation. Under the Terms and Conditions of the MIP, the Committee has the discretion to adjust the reported financial results for incentive plan purposes to correct for any unusual circumstances, both positive and negative, that might affect ROIC or sales growth.

 ​       ​     ​     
[END TABLE]
Incentive amounts paid to Mr. Macpherson, Mr. Howard, Ms. Robbins, Mr. Jadin, and Mr. High were based on the performance targets established for the 2018 MIP and were made under a separate annual incentive program described in the 2015 Incentive Plan. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), this program was intended to qualify annual incentives for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 162(m)). After the enactment of the TCJA, these annual incentives are no longer deductible under Section 162(m). Under the program, the Committee allocates a portion of an incentive pool to each participant. 
Consistent with current practice, the 2019 MIP will continue to utilize daily sales growth along with ROIC as performance measures and all NEOs will be aligned to the Company MIP. 
      Long-Term Incentives       
The Company annually provides long-term incentives to NEOs and other key managers in order to align with the following elements of the Company's strategy to improve shareholder value:
In 2018, in response to market practice, the Company changed the long term incentive mix from 50% stock options and 50% performance shares to 50% stock options and 50% PRSUs. Providing a mix of different types of equity awards is consistent with market practice for senior executives. Using both stock options and PRSUs provides incentives to drive shareholder value creation and the three-year vesting schedule aids in executive retention. The Company's long-term incentives for NEOs are provided under shareholder-approved incentive plans. 
The target number of shares provided for stock options and PRSUs is designed to approximate an economic value that targets the median of the compensation comparator group for comparable jobs. The Compensation Committee annually establishes the target value of the award based on the executive's position. The actual award may be adjusted up or down to reflect individual performance. In 2018, the value was converted to shares using the 200-day average stock price as of January 31, 2018. Beginning with the 2019 equity grants, Grainger will adjust this methodology for both Directors and grant-eligible employees from a 200-day average to a 20-day average to better reflect market practice.

[END TABLE]
   Stock Options  
The Company's stock options provide the right to purchase Company stock at a specified price over a ten-year term with three-year vesting. They are intended to directly link management's and shareholders' interests by tying a substantial portion of long-term incentives to stock price appreciation. The ten-year term is designed to focus the NEOs on long-term value creation. Three-year vesting encourages meaningful retention before an executive can realize any value created by stock price appreciation. Stock option repricing is not permitted under any of the Company's equity incentive plans. Stock options are awarded at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock reported on the business day of the grant. 
   Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs)  
The Company's PRSU program provides the NEOs and other executives with a potential share payout depending on ROIC achievement over a three-year cycle. The actual number of shares paid to an NEO will be either 0% or 100% of the target number of PRSUs awarded. The Compensation Committee (with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant) and management perform a thorough analysis in setting the financial measures and goals for a three-year performance cycle that begins January 1 of the first year. The ROIC component is measured at the end of the third year based on the three-year average. These measurement dates reinforce a long term focus. No dividend equivalents are paid on PRSUs. 
The Compensation Committee selected these performance measures because they balance sales growth with long-term profitability, expense management, and asset management and align with objectives established in the annual incentive program. The Committee may use different sales growth and ROIC objectives and targets from year to year to maximize alignment with then-current business objectives and to reflect economic conditions. 
   2016-2018 Performance Share Cycle  
For the 2016-2018 performance share cycle, the program was designed to reward for achievement based on a three-year average ROIC and 2018 sales. The sales goal was established when 2015 sales were $10.0 billion. The Company's average ROIC performance over the three-year period ending in 2018

In 2018, sales were $11.2 billion, and 3-year average ROIC for the performance period 2016 - 2018 was 25.8%. Accordingly, the participants earned 97% of their target. The Compensation Committee has accepted the Company's calculation of the 3-year average ROIC for purposes of the 2016 - 2018 performance share cycle. 
   2017-2019 Performance Share Cycle  
The structure of the 2017 Performance Share Program is similar to the 2016 program. It is driven by total Company sales achieved in 2019 and 3-year average ROIC. The adjustment to the Target will be made by adding the results of the following two tables:

The Company will continue to evaluate equity vehicles for the 2019 program to remain responsive to market practice while continuing to provide appropriate incentives to drive shareholder value creation. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines  
As of December 31, 2018, all officers subject to stock ownership guidelines, including the NEOs, are in compliance with the guidelines.
The Company continues to believe that requiring executive ownership of Company stock creates alignment between executives and shareholders and encourages executives to act to increase shareholder value. In 1996, the Company established stock ownership guidelines for its NEOs and other officers. In 2011, the Company increased the minimum ownership requirement for the CEO from 5x base salary to 6x and established a retention ratio for equity awards. The stock ownership guidelines for the current NEOs are as follows:

These stock ownership guidelines must be met within three years of being appointed an officer or assuming a new position and are reviewed annually by the Board. NEOs are required to hold exercised option shares and other stock awards until ownership requirements are met. Officers who fail to achieve these ownership levels will not be allowed to sell shares received from the vesting of equity awards until they comply with the guidelines. Shares owned directly by the officer (including those held as a joint tenant or as a tenant in common), shares owned in a self-directed IRA, shares owned or held for the benefit of a spouse or minor children, PRSUs, and RSUs are counted toward meeting the guidelines. Stock options (whether vested or unvested) and performance share awards are not counted toward meeting the ownership guidelines.

Hedging and Pledging Prohibition  
The Company's Business Conduct Guidelines (which are available in the Governance section of Grainger's website at  http://www.grainger.com/investor) prohibit employees and the Board of Directors from engaging in any financial arrangement (including, without limitation, short sales, put and call options) that establish a short position in Company stock and are designed to hedge or offset, any decrease in market value of the Company's (or its subsidiaries') equity securities. Company officers and Directors are also prohibited from pledging any Company stock as collateral for a loan or for a margin account. No Directors or executive officers have hedged or pledged any of the shares beneficially owned by them 
Other Benefits  
The other components of the Company's compensation program for NEOs are substantially similar to those available for most of the Company's other employees, other than the benefits discussed in this section. This includes the same health and welfare benefits and the same performance-based retirement profit sharing contribution methodology that is applied to the U.S.-based employees who are retirement profit sharing participants. The Company provides Supplemental Profit Sharing Plans solely to maintain an equal percentage of retirement profit sharing compensation contribution to approximately 160 employees, including NEOs, who would be subject to contribution or compensation limitations imposed on qualified plans by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does not provide any other supplemental retirement benefits to its NEOs or other employees based in the United States. 
Retirement profit sharing is the primary Company-sponsored retirement vehicle for U.S.-based employees. Retirement profit sharing aligns the interests of the Company's employees, management, and shareholders as the Company's annual contribution to retirement profit sharing is based on ROIC. The Company contributes a minimum of 8% of payroll to the plan and provides employees the opportunity to share in the success of the Company beyond this amount only if a threshold return on capital is achieved. The Company's Profit Sharing Plan includes a 401(k) feature for all U.S.-based employees, including the NEOs. Of the 8% Company contribution, the first 3% (which is funded from the retirement profit sharing pool) will go into the 401(k). 
Effective April 2011, the Company requires that the NEOs and certain other Company officers have periodic physical examinations that are paid for by the Company. The Company believes that periodic physical exams are helpful in maintaining the effectiveness of its executive talent. There are currently 11 participants in the program. 
Messrs. Macpherson and Howard and certain other Company officers have grandfathered participation in the Company's Executive Death Benefit Plan that was discontinued effective December 31, 2009. The beneficiary of a participant who dies while employed by the Company is entitled to a taxable benefit of 120 monthly payments of 50% of the participant's monthly compensation, calculated on the basis of salary and target annual incentive. The Company's policy is that, unless offered to other employees, it will not make payments, grants, or awards following the death of an executive in the form of unearned salary or unearned bonuses, accelerated vesting or the continuation in force of unvested equity grants, awards or un-granted equity, perquisites, and other payments or awards made in lieu of compensation. 
Officers are allowed the business use of corporate aircraft, which is chartered by the Company from a third party provider on an as needed basis. Officers also are allowed the business use of a car and driver, while Mr. Macpherson is allowed personal use of a car and driver, subject to reimbursement of the incremental cost of use. These benefits represent a cost-effective method of allowing the Company's top executives to more effectively use their time. All other benefits, including the retirement profit sharing contribution percentages and various welfare benefits provided to U.S. NEOs and other executive officers, are comparable to those provided to the majority of salaried and hourly U.S.-based Company employees.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENTS, AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS  
   The Company does not maintain any employment agreements with its Named Executive Officers.  
Change in Control—Equity Plans  
Under the terms of the Company's 2015 Incentive Plan, which is the source for all equity awards granted after April 2015, "double trigger" vesting provisions apply to all equity awards (i.e., both a change in control occurs and a participant is involuntarily terminated within one year of the change in control). 
Change in Control Agreements  
The Company has 2x Change in Control Agreements (CIC Agreements) with a number of executives, including the NEOs. These CIC Agreements are intended to ensure that in the event of a pending or threatened change in control, the Company retains its management and that their full attention is focused on the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and not on the uncertainty of their future employment prospects under those circumstances. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation  
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a federal income tax deduction to a public company for compensation over $1 million per taxable year paid to the Company's NEOs. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), compensation that qualified as "performance-based" compensation was not subject to the deductibility limit. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to certain transition relief, the TCJA eliminated this exception. Stock Options granted to our NEOs prior to November 2, 2017 under the 2015 Incentive Plan qualify for the transition relief, and gains on exercises of such stock options are considered to be "performance-based" compensation not subject to the $1 million deductibility limit. Any other compensation paid to our NEOs, including awards other than the grandfathered stock options, is subject to the Section 162(m) deductibility limit and all or a portion of such compensation may be nondeductible. While the tax treatment applicable to the Company's compensation programs was considered in the design of these programs, the Company intends to authorize compensation that will not be deductible under Section 162(m) when the Company believes that doing so is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.

   Accounting Considerations  
Upon vesting, settlement, or maturity, equity awards under the 2015 Incentive Plan and predecessor plans are distributed in the form of shares of the Company's common stock. Under the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 718 (formerly FAS 123R), these types of awards are considered equity awards. As a result, the total amount of compensation expense to be recorded for the awards is based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. This fair value is then recorded over the vesting period, usually three years, and is recorded to compensation expense and as an increase in paid-in capital. The amount of compensation expense is not subsequently adjusted for changes in the Company's share price, but it is adjusted for the estimated number of shares to be distributed. If an equity award is forfeited, all previously recorded compensation expensed is reversed. While the accounting treatment described above was considered in the development of the long-term incentive program, it was not a material consideration. 
Compensation Recoupment Policy (Claw backs)  
The Company expanded in its equity compensation agreements the recoupment (or, claw back) provisions for equity and annual incentive payments made to officers. The Company may recover incentive compensation (cash or equity) that was awarded based on achievement of financial results that were the subject of a restatement if the officer engaged in criminal conduct or financial fraud. The Company also may recover all or a portion of any incentive compensation in the case of materially inaccurate financial statements whether or not they result in a restatement and whether or not the executive officer has engaged in wrongful conduct. Recoveries under these provisions can extend back for three years from the date of the initial filing that contained the relevant financial statements. In addition, should an executive violate his or her confidentiality or non-compete obligations, any award is automatically forfeited, and in certain circumstances, the executive must return vested shares and/or gains from disposition of shares to the Company. Finally, the Company may recoup all or a portion of any incentive compensation if the Company determines that the executive has committed fraud against the Company or has engaged in any criminal conduct, including embezzlement or theft, that involves or is related to the Company, engages in any other conduct that violates Company policy, causes or is discovered to have caused, any loss, damage, injury or other endangerment to Grainger's property or reputation, or receives any amount in excess of what the Executive should have received for any reason. 
This policy applies to any incentive compensation awarded or paid to an employee at a time when he or she is an officer. Subsequent changes in status, including retirement or termination of employment, do not impact the Company's rights to recover compensation under this policy. 
Termination  
The Company does not have employment contracts and does not maintain severance programs for its NEOs. The executive's CIC Agreements provide the potential for a lump sum payment following a change in control. Except for a limited period of time following a change in control, the NEOs are not entitled to severance upon termination. 
Retirement  
The definition of retirement eligibility is the same for all U.S. employees. Under this definition, an employee is retirement-eligible upon attaining any of the following:

Mr. Howard is retirement-eligible. Mr. Jadin retired as of May 2, 2018 and Mr. High retired as of August 31, 2018. 
The Company provides the following upon retirement for all employees, including NEOs: 
The following tables illustrate the potential incremental payments and benefits that could be received by the NEOs upon a termination or change in control of the Company. The amounts shown below assume that such termination or change in control was effective as of December 31, 2018 and thus only includes amounts earned through such date. However, the actual amounts that would be paid out under each circumstance can only be determined at the time of separation.

      CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE       
Under SEC rules, we are required to calculate and disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Macpherson, our Chairman and CEO, to the annual total compensation of our median employee. As permitted under the SEC rules, in order to identify our median employee, we used a consistently applied compensation measure of 'base pay' earned during the period from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017, rather than summary compensation table (SCT) total compensation for all of 2017. We annualized base pay for those employees who commenced work during 2017. The identified median employee is a full-time, U.S.-based employee. We then determined their full year's compensation based on the compensation elements required for inclusion in the SCT, with the exception of incorporating healthcare benefits in Total Compensation as discussed later in this section. The other components of our compensation program for NEOs are substantially similar to those available for most of our other employees. This includes the same health and welfare benefits and the same performance-based retirement profit sharing contribution methodology that is applied to the U.S.-based employees who are retirement profit sharing participants. 
As of December 31, 2018, Grainger had approximately 24,600 employees, of whom approximately 23,100 were full-time and 1,500 were part-time or temporary. 
We utilized the de minimis exemption to exclude approximately 4% of our global workforce, or 920 employees, as reflected below:
The median employee's circumstances have not materially changed relative to 2017. Also, we have not had significant changes in our workforce, such as employee population size fluctuations, acquisition or divestitures, nor have we had significant changes in our pay programs that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to this pay ratio disclosure. Therefore, we believe the previously identified median employee for 2017 remains appropriate for 2018. 
In calculating Total Compensation for our median employee and CEO, we included the estimated company cost of their respective Company-provided health and wellness benefits. The CEO's Total Compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 is $10,455,844. The CEO's Total Compensation for purposes of our pay ratio disclosure calculation is $10,465,572, which differs from the Total Compensation described in the Summary Compensation Table on page 57 of this document by his health and wellness benefits amount. The median employee's estimated Total Compensation for 2018 was $67,316 (which includes compensation of $57,588 and estimated benefits of $9,728). The ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay is 155:1. The reasons the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay differs from the ratio disclosed in our 2018 proxy statement include:

[END TABLE]
The Company is asking its shareholders for their non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of its Named Executive Officers (Say on Pay) as disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC rules. 
As described in detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Company's compensation program is based upon a philosophy that is applied to all Company employees—to attract and retain the best people and provide appropriate performance-based incentives that encourage them to achieve results that create long-term shareholder value. The Company sets target compensation for the Named Executive Officers to approximate the market median of compensation at companies of similar size and complexity. Employees at all levels of the Company, including its executives, are provided clear incentives to grow the business (Sales Growth) while achieving investment returns (Return on Invested Capital or ROIC) for the Company's shareholders. The compensation program is structured to significantly reward long-term performance while not encouraging excessive risk taking. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis/ page 39 for additional details about the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. 
This Say on Pay vote is intended to address the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement as a whole rather than any specific item or amount of executive compensation. 
We are asking our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following advisory resolution at the Company's 2019 annual meeting: 
This advisory vote on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers is determined by the votes of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote. 
This Say on Pay vote is advisory and non-binding on the Company, our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board. However, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is comprised of independent Directors, expect to take into account the outcome of this Say on Pay vote when making future compensation decisions regarding Grainger's Named Executive Officers. 
Approval of the proposal requires the affirmative votes of a majority of the shares of Grainger common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS  
Grainger's Business Conduct Guidelines require that conflicts of interest in any form be avoided. The Board has adopted written policies and procedures, to be applied by the BANC, for the review, approval, or ratification of any transactions with related persons. Those policies and procedures apply to any proposed transaction in which Grainger is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and any Director, executive officer, or significant shareholder or any immediate family member of such a person has a direct or material indirect interest. The policy requires that any such proposed transaction be reviewed by the BANC to determine, among other things, the benefits of the transaction to Grainger, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, and whether the terms of the proposed transaction are comparable to those provided to unrelated third parties. The BANC determined that the Company did not engage in any related person transactions in 2018. 
In the ordinary course of its operations during 2018, Grainger engaged in various types of transactions with organizations with which Grainger Directors are associated in their principal business occupations or otherwise. Specifically, in the ordinary course of its business during 2018, Grainger bought products and/or services from, or sold products and/or services to, companies with which Ms. Perez, and Messrs. Santi, Slavik and Watson are or were associated as senior executives or otherwise as of December 31, 2018. In no instance did the total amount of the purchases from or sales to any such company during 2018 represent more than 0.176% of the consolidated gross revenues of that company for the year or more than 0.224% of the consolidated gross revenues of Grainger for the year. 
In addition, as part of its overall 2018 charitable contributions program, Grainger made donations to tax-exempt organizations with which one or more Directors serve as officers, directors or trustees. In no instance did the total amount of the contributions to any charitable organization exceed $7,500 during 2018.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What is the difference between holding shares as "shareholder of record" and as "beneficial owner"?    
[END TABLE]
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Grainger's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are the shareholder of record with respect to those shares and you have the right to instruct us directly how to vote your shares or to vote in person at the meeting. 
If your shares are held in street name by a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you are the beneficial owner of the shares. Your nominee is required to vote your shares according to your direction. If you do not instruct your nominee how you want your shares voted, your shares cannot be voted for the election of Directors or on the advisory vote on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers. Please contact your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee with instructions to vote your shares for the election of Directors and on the advisory vote on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers, and on other matters to be considered at the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     If my shares are held in "street name," can my broker vote for me?    
[END TABLE]
Unless you have given specific voting instructions to your broker, your broker cannot vote your shares on the election of Directors, on the advisory vote related to executive compensation, or on any non-routine matters. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What is cumulative voting? How many votes do I have?    
[END TABLE]
You have the right to cumulative voting in the election of Directors. This means that you have a number of votes in the election equal to the number of shares you own multiplied by the number of Directors being elected. You can cast those votes for the nominees as you choose. For example, you may cast all your votes for one nominee or you may apportion your votes among two or more nominees. 
Cumulative voting is only available for Director elections. In any matter other than the election of Directors, each of your shares is entitled to one vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Does Grainger have majority voting for the election of Directors with a resignation policy for Directors failing to receive the required majority vote?    
[END TABLE]
Yes. As required under Illinois law, Directors may only be elected by the votes of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. Moreover, in accordance with the Company's Criteria for Membership on the Board of Directors, any Director standing for re-election (including the 11 nominees standing for election at the annual meeting) who fails to receive the required majority vote is expected to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the BANC. The BANC will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors concerning the acceptance or rejection of the resignation. The Board will then take formal action on the BANC's recommendation within 90 days after the results of the Director election at the annual meeting are certified. Following the Board's decision on the BANC's recommendation, the Company will publicly disclose the Board's decision.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     What voting standard applies to the advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers?    
[END TABLE]
Although the shareholders' vote is advisory and therefore non-binding, the vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers (Say on Pay)—Grainger's seven highest paid officers whose compensation is discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement—is determined by the votes of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    How frequently does Grainger conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of its Named Executive Officers?    
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has determined to hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers (Say on Pay) at every annual meeting of shareholders. Shareholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of Say on Pay votes at least every six years. At the 2017 annual meeting, the shareholders voted for one year as the frequency of the Say on Pay vote. The next advisory vote on the frequency of the Say on Pay vote will occur at Grainger's 2023 annual meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What if I don't indicate my voting choices?    
[END TABLE]
If Grainger receives your proxy in time to permit its use at the meeting, your shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions you indicate. If we have received your proxy and you have not indicated otherwise, your shares will be voted as recommended by Grainger's Board. Specifically, your shares will be voted, either individually or cumulatively:
If you are a beneficial owner and the shares you own are held in street name by a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee you must specifically instruct your nominee how you want your shares voted for the election of Directors, on the advisory resolution on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers, and on the frequency of the shareholder advisory votes on the compensation of Grainger's Named Executive Officers; otherwise your nominee is not allowed to vote your shares. Please contact your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee with instructions to vote your shares for the election of Directors and on other matters to be considered at the meeting.
