IMPORTANT CHANGES TO COMPENSATION PROGRAM IN 2018 See page 37 
[END TABLE]
We made several key enhancements to our compensation programs in 2018 to continue to improve the link between compensation and our business performance and talent retention strategies as well as the long-term interests of our shareholders.
2018 Short-Term Incentive Plan
Beginning in 2018, we adopted a more formulaic approach to our annual incentive plan design for our senior executive team. In prior years, the results of the formulaic plans, which have been in place at our underwriting units since inception, has been the basis upon which the compensation decisions have been made for our named executive officers. However, with the adoption of our new plan design, we now formally link the financial performance achieved by each of our Reporting Segments (i.e., insurance, reinsurance and mortgage) and of our investment function, as measured under the current formulaic plans, to the specific payments to be made to our named executive officers. Please refer to "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Elements of Compensation Program—Short-Term Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses."
2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan
To further align the interests of our named executive officers and shareholders, we have moved away from exclusive time-based vesting to add a majority of performance-based vehicles to the structure of our long-term incentive awards for senior executives. Beginning with grants in 2018, the majority of such awards is in the form of performance shares. Please refer to "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Elements of Compensation Program—2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards."

SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT See page 36  
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT See page 36  
[END TABLE]
We maintain an ongoing, proactive outreach effort with our shareholders. Throughout the year, members of our Investor Relations team and leaders of our business engage with our shareholders to seek their input, to remain well-informed regarding their perspectives and to help increase their understanding of our business. Over the past year, as part of our engagement with our shareholders, members of our Compensation Committee, our lead director and members of senior management had discussions with institutional shareholders representing a significant number of our outstanding common shares to discuss, among other things, our executive compensation program. We remain committed to listening to feedback from shareholders as we continue to review and evaluate our compensation programs.

Board
Leadership Structure
The Board reviews the Company's leadership structure from time to time. As part of the transition of the role of chief executive officer from Mr. Iordanou to Mr. Grandisson in early 2018, the Board determined that a split in the role of chairman of the board and chief executive officer was appropriate and in the best interests of the Company's shareholders. The Board also elected to maintain the role of independent lead director, a role in which John Pasquesi, a non-management/independent director, currently serves. Since then, the Board has decided to retain the split role of chairman of the board and chief executive officer, and has announced that John Pasquesi will assume the role of chairman of the board in September 2019, effective with the completion of Mr. Iordanou's term as chairman of the board. Mr. Pasquesi has been a director and vice chairman since October 2001 and lead director since November 2017, and has a deep knowledge of Arch and the industry in which we compete.
Several factors ensure that we have a strong and independent Board. All directors, with the exception of Messrs. Grandisson, Iordanou and Vollaro, are independent as defined under the applicable listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ"), and the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees of our Board are composed entirely of independent directors. The Company's independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from many industries, including the insurance industry. In addition to feedback provided during the course of Board meetings, the independent directors regularly meet in executive session without management present. The Board also has regular access to our management team.
Until September 2019, the lead director will coordinate the activities of the other non-management/independent directors, and perform such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine. The lead director presides at all meetings of the Board at which the chairman of the board is not present, including executive sessions of the non-management/independent directors, and has the authority to call meetings of the non-management/independent directors. The lead director also serves as principal liaison among the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer and the non-management/independent directors and works with the chairman of the board to develop an appropriate schedule of Board meetings and to establish the agendas for Board meetings. In addition, the lead director advises the chairman of the board as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information from the Company's management that is necessary for the non-management/independent directors to effectively and responsibly perform their duties. The lead director is also available, when appropriate, for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders.
Board Independence and Composition
Our Board consists of 11 directors, including eight non-employee directors. Our Board has concluded that the following eight non-employee directors are independent in accordance with the director independence standards set forth in Rule 5600 of the rules of NASDAQ: John L. Bunce, Jr., Eric W. Doppstadt, Laurie S. Goodman, Yiorgos Lillikas, Louis J. Paglia, John M. Pasquesi, Brian S. Posner and Eugene S. Sunshine. In making these independence determinations, the Board reviewed the relationships with the directors set forth under the captions "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation" and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions", including ordinary course transactions not meeting the disclosure threshold with insurers, reinsurers and producers in which a director or a fund affiliated with any of our directors maintained at least a 10% ownership interest.
Role in Risk Oversight
Our Board, as a whole and also at the committee level, has an active role in overseeing management of the Company's risks. The Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company's business and operations, including with respect to underwriting, investments, capital management, liquidity, financial reporting and compliance, as well as the risks associated with these activities.

Employment Agreement of John Vollaro
Our employment agreement with John Vollaro provides for his employment period to continue on the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement for an indefinite period until terminated by either party by providing at least six months' prior written notice to the other party. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Vollaro has served as Senior Advisor of Arch Capital since April 1, 2009. Mr. Vollaro's base salary is paid at the rate $250,000 per annum, and the target rate for the annual cash bonus is 100% of the annual base salary. Mr. Vollaro is eligible to receive annual cash bonuses and share-based awards at the discretion of Arch Capital's Board and is also entitled to participate in employee benefit programs such as major medical, life insurance and disability insurance, the cost of preparation of annual tax returns and associated tax planning, and other fringe benefits customarily provided to similarly situated senior executives. His agreement also provides that the Company will reimburse him for his reasonable expenses incurred traveling between Bermuda and the United States. 
The agreement provides that if Mr. Vollaro's employment is terminated without cause prior to the end of the term, he will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of the total remaining base salary and target annual bonus which would have been paid to Mr. Vollaro under his employment agreement for the period through six months after the date of termination of employment (the "Severance Amount"). The Severance Amount would be payable over 12 months. The agreement also provides that if Mr. Vollaro's employment is terminated for cause, as a result of his resignation, as a result of death or permanent disability, or by written notice of the intention not to renew the agreement by us or Mr. Vollaro, he (or his estate) will be entitled to receive his base salary through the date of termination. The agreement further provides that if Mr. Vollaro's employment is terminated by reason of death or permanent disability, he (or his estate) will also be entitled to receive for the period extending through the remainder of the employment period, an amount equal to the Severance Amount, in each case, (i) offset by any proceeds received from any insurance coverages provided by the Company, and (ii) such amount, will be paid to him (or his estate) promptly upon death or permanent disability, as applicable, and in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year of such termination of employment. Mr. Vollaro's major medical insurance coverage benefits pursuant to his employment agreement will continue for 12 months after the date of termination (or until he is provided by another employer with benefits substantially comparable, with no pre-existing condition limitations, to the benefits provided by such plan) in the event that his employment ends due to permanent disability, or he is terminated other than for cause.
Mr. Vollaro has agreed that, during the employment period and for a period of two years after termination of 
[BEGIN TABLE]
20 |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
employment for cause or as a result of his resignation, he will not compete with the businesses of Arch Capital or any of its subsidiaries as such businesses exist or are in process or being planned as of the date of termination. If we terminate Mr. Vollaro's employment without cause, the term of his noncompetition period will extend for one year following termination. Mr. Vollaro also agreed that he will not, for a period of two years following his date of termination, induce or attempt to induce any of our employees to leave his or her position with us or induce any customer to cease doing business with us.
Matters Relating to Director Share Ownership 
In an effort to further align the interests of the non-employee directors with the interests of shareholders, the Company has adopted:
Share Ownership Guidelines: Share ownership guidelines require the directors to retain common shares having a value of at least three times the annual cash retainer fee payable to the director. Each non-employee director has five years to comply with the guidelines, and stock options, SARs and unvested restricted shares/units do not count toward the requirement. 
Share Holding Requirements: Until our non-employee directors meet their target ownership levels, they must retain an amount equal to 50% of the net profit shares received from Arch Capital's equity awards until they have attained the applicable share ownership level. Net profit shares are the shares remaining after payment of the exercise price of an option and taxes owed on exercise of options or SARs, vesting of restricted stock, or vesting and payout under restricted stock units and performance shares. 
No Hedging Permitted: As part of our Code of Business Conduct, our officers, directors and other employees are not permitted to engage in hedging activities with respect to Arch Capital's common stock or any other publicly-traded equity or debt securities issued by Arch Capital or any of its subsidiaries. Specifically, they may not engage in short sales, purchase or sale of financial instruments or derivatives, including puts and calls, that hedge or offset any change in the market value of such securities. In addition, our officers, directors and other employees may not otherwise engage in transactions that are designed to, or have, the same effect.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Generally, transactions with related persons are subject to review by the Board of Arch Capital. The Board has adopted written procedures regarding the review of transactions involving companies affiliated with a company in which a non-employee director or executive officer of Arch Capital has a material interest (each a "portfolio company"), on the one hand, and Arch Capital or one of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.
Under the procedures, these transactions must be reviewed and approved by the management of Arch Capital or the operating subsidiary entering into the transaction (as applicable), and the terms of such transaction should be arm's-length or on terms that are otherwise fair to Arch Capital and its subsidiaries. In addition, these transactions also require the approval of Arch Capital under its holding company oversight guidelines, except for the following: (1) ordinary course transactions pursuant to which any insurance subsidiary of Arch Capital writes a direct insurance policy for a portfolio company where the Company will receive less than $3.0 million in annual premiums and (2) a transaction in which a U.S.-based subsidiary of Arch Capital (a) assumes reinsurance from, or cedes reinsurance to, a portfolio company or (b) provides direct insurance to a portfolio company pursuant to which the Company will receive $3.0 million or more in annual premiums, in which case, the general counsel of Arch Capital Services Inc. should be pre-notified and appropriate steps will be implemented based on the transaction. In reviewing these proposed transactions, the effects, if any, on the independence of the relevant directors are considered under the governing NASDAQ and SEC standards. Any applicable regulatory, tax and ratings agency matters are also considered. Under these procedures, the Board is provided with an update of related party transactions entered into by the Company in accordance with the procedures on a regular basis.
Graham B.R. Collis, a director of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, is a director of the law firm of Conyers Dill & Pearman Limited, which provides legal services to the Company and its subsidiaries.
See also "Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation" for a description of transactions with certain related persons.
Based on a Schedule 13G/A filed in February 2019, BlackRock Inc. ("BlackRock") owned approximately 6.9% of the outstanding common shares of Arch Capital as of December 31, 2018. BlackRock, through its subsidiaries, provides various investment management, investment trade support and risk analysis services to Arch Capital and its subsidiaries. During 2018, the Company incurred $11.2 million of fees, in the aggregate, under these services arrangements with BlackRock.
In January 2017, the Company and Kelso & Co. ("Kelso"), sponsored Premia Reinsurance Ltd., a newly formed multiline Bermuda reinsurance company ("Premia Re"). Premia Re's strategy is to reinsure or acquire companies or reserve portfolios in the non-life property and casualty insurance and reinsurance run-off market. The initial capitalization of Premia Re's parent, Premia Holdings Ltd. ("Premia"), consisted of $400.0 million in common equity and $110.0 million in unsecured senior debt. Arch Re Bermuda and certain Arch co-investors, including senior management of Premia, invested $100.0 million and acquired 25.0% of Premia's common equity as well as warrants to purchase additional common equity. Two of the co-investors included Nicolas Papadopoulo, Chairman and CEO of Arch Worldwide Insurance Group and Chief Underwriting Officer for Property and Casualty Operations, who invested $2.5 million for a 0.625% stake, and Maamoun Rajeh, Chairman and CEO of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance Group, who invested $0.5 million for a 0.125% stake. Affiliates of Kelso, along with co-investors of Kelso, invested $300.0 million and acquired the balance of Premia's common equity as well as warrants to purchase additional common equity. Arch Re Bermuda is providing a 25% whole account quota share reinsurance treaty on business written by Premia Re. For the 2018 year, no business was written through the quota share agreement between Premia Re and Arch Re Bermuda. Arch Re Bermuda has appointed two directors to serve on the seven person board of directors of Premia Re. Subsidiaries of Arch Capital are providing certain administrative and support services to Premia pursuant to services agreements.
In 2018, we made a $129,000 contribution to the Urban Institute, a non-profit research organization that employs Laurie S. Goodman.
From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into transactions, including insurance and reinsurance transactions and brokerage or other arrangements for the production of business, with entities in which companies or funds affiliated with beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding voting shares or directors of Arch Capital may have an ownership or other interest.

COMPENSATION
ITEM 2—ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
We are pleased to ask our shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the "Executive Compensation Tables." 
In deciding how to vote on this proposal, the Board encourages you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Compensation Tables sections. Over the last year, we implemented significant enhancements to our compensation programs to continue to improve the link between compensation and the Company's business performance and talent retention strategies as well as the long-term interests of our shareholders. We have a "pay-for-performance" philosophy that forms the foundation of all decisions regarding compensation of our named executive officers. 
We are requesting shareholder approval of the compensation of our named executive officers pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis", the "Executive 
Compensation Tables" and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any one specific item of compensation, but instead the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement.
Your vote is advisory and therefore it will not be binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee of the Board or the Board. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the views of our shareholders and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the advisory vote when considering executive compensation.

Compensation Program at a Glance
As part of the Compensation Committee's ongoing review of the Company's programs and in order to help ensure continued alignment between pay and performance, the Compensation Committee evaluates the Company's compensation programs for its senior management team. The results of this evaluation during last year have included the incorporation of pre-established performance goals into both the annual and long-term incentive programs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salary Short-Term Incentives Long-Term    Share-Based Performance-Based Shareholder Return Modifier 
  Long-Term Incentives 
Base salaries attract, retain and compensate executives based on level of responsibility and experience.  Formulaic approach to our annual incentive plan design, which aligns payments made to named executive officers to the financial performance achieved by our Reporting Segments and investment function. Long-term share-based incentive awards to senior executives comprise (i) 80% performance- based: 55% performance shares and 25% stock options, and (ii) 20% time-based restricted shares. Stock options and time-based restricted stock have three-year ratable vesting.       Performance-based long-term share-based incentive awards granted to senior executives payout in shares at the end of each three-year period based on growth in tangible book value per share, a strong indicator of growth in shareholder value. Performance-based long-term share-based incentive awards contain a total shareholder return modifier to further tie awards to long-term shareholder value. 
                                    Performance Metrics 
Annual and long-term performance metrics have rigorous target goals and include minimum threshold amounts that must be achieved in order for an executive to receive a payout. Additionally, maximum payout as a percentage of target is capped at 200% for both the annual and long-term incentive plans.

[END TABLE]
Strong Link Between Pay and Performance
Our executive compensation programs are designed to link pay and performance and to align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders by tying significant portions of their compensation to the Company's financial performance and stock price performance. As noted, in 2018 we adopted a more formulaic approach to our annual incentive plan design for our senior executive team and changed the structure of our long-term incentive awards for senior executives so that the majority of such awards granted are in the form of performance shares. 
CEO Target Mix of Pay
As illustrated above for our CEO, 73% of target compensation was performance-based and 63% consists of long-term incentives.
Other Named Executives Target Mix of Pay1   
As illustrated above for our other named executives, 67% of target compensation was performance-based and 45% consists of long-term incentives.
1 Excludes Chairman of the Board
Oversight of Pay and Performance
In assessing overall performance, the Compensation Committee undertakes a rigorous process pursuant to which financial targets are set under the short-term and long-term incentive plans and specific strategic goals are established at the beginning of the year and tracked throughout the year. Each year, senior management prepares a strategic plan and outlines a plan for the accomplishment of the objectives of the strategic plan. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Company's strategic plan and approves key financial and strategic goals and measurements. The attainment of these goals and measures is reflected in the determination of actual payouts under the short-term annual incentive plan.
When evaluating pay reported in the Summary Compensation Table, it is important to consider the timing of compensation decisions and which performance period informs each of the annual and long-term equity incentive awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ The short-term annual incentive awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 were decided in February 2019 and reflect achievement of financial metrics and individual strategic metrics related to 2018 year performance. See "Elements of Compensation Program—Short-Term Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses." 
▪ Long-term equity incentive awards reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 and reported in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table were granted in May 2018.

2018 Performance at a Glance1 
1 Excludes amounts related to the "other" segment (i.e., Watford). All per share amounts are on a diluted basis.
2 See Annex B—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.
Although, taken together, 2017 and 2018 produced extreme catastrophe insured losses, we performed reasonably well during that period. As pricing for many insurance and reinsurance lines remained under pressure notwithstanding the California wildfires, Hurricane Michael and other natural disasters, our strategic principles served us well, as we continue to grow in mortgage insurance, where market conditions are favorable. Mortgage insurance is an important part of our strategy, complementing our strong positions in specialty insurance and reinsurance and serving to counterbalance the cyclical nature of the property casualty market. Our diversification across these segments, together with our strong balance sheet, allows us to allocate capital between and within segments as market conditions dictate. Although the profitability of our property casualty insurance and reinsurance operations declined due to market softness, this was partly offset by the robust growth and excellent profitability of our mortgage insurance and reinsurance activities. 
Our combined ratio of 81.0% for 2018 was at the 88th percentile of our Peer Group  (as defined below). Our performance on an average basis for 2018 was at the 57th percentile of our Peer Group  for the four key measures we track for compensation purposes: (1) operating income return on average common equity, (2) net income return on average common equity, (3) growth in tangible book value per share and (4) total shareholder return ("TSR"). Our performance is at the 68th percentile when annual TSR performance is excluded. Refer to "Common Share Performance" discussion.
Achievements in 2018
The following are among the highlights of our achievements during 2018 in advancing our strategic initiatives.
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Mortgage insurance and reinsurance was our most profitable segment in 2018 and represented 24% of our premium volume. The group also successfully introduced a new means of accepting mortgage credit risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and participated in several credit-risk transfer programs that are all designed to attract a diversified and robust capital base to the U.S. housing market and encourage market stability through economic cycles. 
▪ Reinsurance growth reflected increased writings of motor business in Europe and reinstatement premiums from catastrophe events. The segment also reduced participation in large commoditized risks and continued to uncover deals in a soft market, which speaks to its diversified platform and dynamic portfolio. 
▪ The Insurance segment responded to an extended soft market by carving out positions in those specialty areas where it sees attractive opportunities, including increased positions in travel and accident insurance. The Insurance segment also expanded its footprint in both the U.S. and Europe with business acquisitions that will provide a wider network and better service to our customers.

Long-Term Performance
We believe the Company's performance is best measured over the long term. The following charts highlight certain of our key metrics for evaluating financial performance, which are considered in our compensation decisions. In evaluating the performance of the Company in connection with our compensation programs, we focus primarily on two main benchmarks: growth in book and tangible book value per share, which creates long-term shareholder value, and Net Income Return on Equity ("ROE") and Operating ROE, which drive book value growth and are key indicators of the efficient use of capital.
Book Value and Tangible Book Value per Common Share
Book Value per Common Share ("BVPS"): Since our recapitalization in 2001, we have delivered strong results to our shareholders as our BVPS has grown by approximately 960% from $2.03 at December 31, 2001 to $21.52 at December 31, 2018. Shareholders who invested in our recapitalization and continue to hold their common shares have seen the book value of their stock increase by 14.9% per year on a compounded basis and the price of their shares increase approximately 1,102% to $26.72 from $2.22.
Tangible Book Value per Common Share ("TBVPS"): Growth in this measure, which excludes goodwill and intangible assets, is indicative of our underlying results and is a strong indicator of growth in shareholder value for a property and casualty insurer and reinsurer and a common financial performance measure for companies in our industry. As such, Arch Capital focuses the long-term component of its executive compensation program on building TBVPS over time.

Return on Equity
Our ROE for 2018 was adversely impacted by catastrophe losses and continued compressed margins for many property casualty insurance and reinsurance products.  Over a longer term, our ROEs have been closer to our return objectives, but reflect the negative impact of historically low interest rates throughout most of the last 10 years, competitive market conditions in the property casualty industry and significant U.S. and global catastrophe losses in 2011, 2012, 2017 and 2018.

Common Share Performance
The chart below summarizes Arch Capital's cumulative total shareholder return, assuming reinvestment of dividends, from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2018, compared with the S&P 500 Composite Stock Index ("S&P 500 Index") and the S&P 500 Property and Casualty Insurance Index ("S&P 500 P&C Index"). During this 17-year period, the price of Arch Capital's common stock appreciated at a compound annual rate of 14.05%, compared with a compound annual rate of return of 6.84% for the S&P 500 Index and 7.46% for the S&P 500 P&C Index. The share price performance presented below is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Total Shareholder Return 
[END TABLE]
At December 31, 2018, the closing price of our common shares was $26.72. Although the price of our common shares was down 11.7% in 2018, the performance has been strong over the longer term. For example, our common share price appreciated by 5.2% in 2017 and by 13.1% on a compound annualized basis over the past 10 years. While stock valuations tend to fluctuate based on market conditions, our primary metric of value creation is book value growth over time. In addition, at December 31, 2018, our common share price represented approximately 124% of our year-end 2018 book value per common share, which remained healthy relative to our peers, when taking into account our business mix. For the property and casualty industry, price to book value is viewed as an important indicator of company performance by analysts and the investment community.
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
We are a leading, Bermuda-based specialty insurer and reinsurer with a global presence. Our job as an insurer is to understand and price risk and in doing so to generate superior risk-adjusted returns from the insurance and reinsurance coverages we write. Accordingly, it is critical that we recruit, retain and motivate the best talent in the global marketplace. Over time and in light of our business strategy, we have sought to develop a compensation philosophy that both supports and is consistent with our risk-management practices, and that helps to ensure that our compensation programs align our executives and employees with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our compensation philosophy seeks to reinforce and reward long-term value creation by motivating our named executive officers through pay practices based substantially on the overall success of the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | 33 
[END TABLE]
Company. To achieve these goals, we have designed our executive compensation programs to retain and reward leaders who create long-term value for our shareholders. The combination of fixed and variable compensation is performance-based, and consists of short-term annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term incentive share-based awards, while the fixed component of the compensation is designed to reflect the significant levels of their experience, duties and scope of responsibility in leading the Company's underwriting and operating activities.
While we consider a number of factors in our compensation programs, we are guided by four core principles.
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Link Pay with Performance: The great majority of our pay for executives is at-risk and performance-based with metrics aligned to the Company's short-term and long-term financial results and business strategy. Pay should have a clear connection to each executive's individual contribution to increasing value for our shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Attract, Retain and Align: We maintain programs that will attract and retain critical talent, drive future growth and create strong shareholder alignment within our executive population. 
▪ Support Culture: We support the Arch Capital culture of teamwork, underwriting discipline and commitment to the highest ethical standards. 
▪ Provide Market Competitive Pay: For each executive position, we consider external market data at median values for base salary, annual target bonus levels and annualized long-term incentive target grants. Based upon the considerable range of unique facts and circumstances pertaining to our executive talent, we adjust opportunities as appropriate to take into consideration various factors such as consistent high performance and value delivery to the Company, retention, succession, successful tenure and other  factors. 
[END TABLE]
How We Make Compensation Decisions
Compensation Committee Process
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of, and approves the compensation paid to, the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ The chief executive officer assists in the reviews of the named executive officers other than himself and makes individual recommendations to the Compensation Committee on base salary, annual incentive and long-term share-based compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews, discusses, modifies and approves these compensation recommendations. 
▪ The Compensation Committee meets in executive sessions (without management present) as necessary, particularly when making determinations about base salary, annual incentive and long-term equity compensation, or administering any aspect of the compensation program for the chairman of the board and president and chief executive officer of Arch Capital. Determinations about compensation matters in respect of the chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of Arch Capital, the chief financial officer of Arch Capital, the general counsel of Arch Capital Services Inc., and other senior executives designated by the Compensation Committee are subject to ratification by the Board. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ To establish levels of base salary, annual incentives, long-term incentives and benefits, the Compensation Committee reviews extensive historical competition data, including detailed tally sheets, information compiled from annual reports on Form 10-K, proxy statements and other publicly available information for a representative sample of publicly-traded insurers and reinsurers that we believe compete directly with us for executive talent (the "Peer Group"). Many of these selected peers are of generally similar size and have generally similar numbers of employees, product offerings and geographic scope.  
[END TABLE]
Risk Management and Compensation Policies 
In line with the Company's requirements for managing risks associated with the Company's compensation programs, the Compensation Committee seeks to ensure our executive compensation program does not encourage executives to take excessive risks that are inconsistent with the long-term success of the Company. We emphasize long term results both in our short-term incentive program, which is tied to Company underwriting results over a 10-year development period, and in our long-term incentive program where a substantial component of compensation is performance-based and granted in the form of multi-year vesting share-based awards, which make stock price 
[BEGIN TABLE]
34 |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
appreciation over an extended period of time fundamental in realizing a compensation benefit.
Our compensation philosophy and governance features are also complemented by several specific elements such as (i) a clawback policy, (ii) no hedging and (iii) share ownership guidelines and share holding requirements that are designed to align our compensation with long-term shareholder interests. See "Additional Compensation Policies and Practices" for further detail.
We believe our approach to evaluation of performance and the design of our compensation programs assist in mitigating excessive risk-taking that could harm our Company and have concluded that there is no excessive risk inherent in our programs. 
Role of Compensation Consultant
Our Compensation Committee has sole authority to select, retain and terminate any consultants or advisors used to provide independent advice to the Compensation Committee and evaluate executive compensation, including sole authority to approve the fees and any other retention terms for any such consultant or advisor. The Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") as its independent executive compensation consultant to assist in establishing compensation policies and programs. During 2018, Meridian:
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ reviewed and advised the Compensation Committee on matters concerning compensation of the CEO and our other named executive officers; 
▪ reported on all aspects of short-term and long-term compensation program design, including incentive mix and our Peer Group; 
▪ reported on emerging trends and developments in executive compensation and corporate governance; 
▪ prepared formal presentations for the Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation; 
▪ reviewed compensation benchmarking analysis for each of the Company's senior executives; and 
▪ reviewed and advised on director compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Meridian did not provide any other services to the Company and no other fees were paid to Meridian except fees related to their services to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee believes that Meridian is independent and no conflict of interest exists.
Selected Competitors
For purposes of making compensation decisions and for evaluating our financial performance relative to peers we used compensation and financial data derived from the Peer Group listed below. We periodically review the companies in our Peer Group with Meridian.

At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 72.5% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. We wanted to improve these results and, during the latter half of 2017 and beginning of 2018, the members of our Compensation Committee, our lead director and members of senior management had discussions with institutional shareholders representing a significant number of our outstanding common shares. We took a critical look at our compensation program for our senior executives and, as a result, conducted a review of the programs and listened to feedback received from our institutional shareholders.
As a result of our comprehensive compensation review, we strengthened our pay-for-performance structure for the 2018 performance year to improve alignment between executive compensation with achievement of pre-established financial metrics. The changes made in 2018 reflect (i) a commitment to enhanced pay-for-performance philosophy with incentive compensation more clearly linked to the financial performance achieved by each of our Reporting Segments (i.e., insurance, reinsurance and mortgage) and of our investment function; (ii) the expanded use of pre-defined metrics for the determination of annual incentive payments; and (iii) the introduction of performance criteria within our Long-Term Incentive Plan for our senior executives.
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, 91.5% of the votes cast approved the Company's executive compensation programs and the resulting compensation described in the 2018 Proxy Statement. Based on this high level of support, the Compensation Committee determined that shareholders support our compensation practices and will continue to work to ensure that our named executive officers' interests are aligned with our shareholders' interests to support long-term value creation. 
In addition, we continue to reach out to our largest institutional shareholders and engage them in discussions regarding our executive compensation program. We remain committed to listening to feedback from shareholders when designing, reviewing and evaluating our compensation programs and policies.

Elements of Compensation Program
We have three primary elements of total direct compensation for our executive compensation program: base salary, short-term annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term incentive share-based awards, all of which are described below. We also provide standard retirement and benefit plans and limited perquisites customarily provided to expatriates residing in Bermuda.
Base Salary
Base salary is fixed cash compensation and integral to any employment arrangement. Salary is reviewed annually and adjusted when appropriate. Increases are not automatic or guaranteed. Placement of our named executive officers within a salary range is based on market data for the individual's position and geographic location as well as his experience, duties and scope of responsibility. From time to time, salaries may be adjusted to reflect promotions, increases in responsibilities and competitive considerations.
Short-Term Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses
For each executive participant, target bonus award levels are established, stated as a percentage of base salary. These levels are based on external market data at median values adjusted as appropriate, to take into consideration various factors such as consistent high performance and value delivery to the Company, retention and succession. 
Award levels are designed to provide formulaic payouts to our senior executives and serve as a critical tool for rewarding the achievement of annual corporate and individual goals. Amounts are earned based on the attainment of quantitative and qualitative strategic accomplishments for the relevant year. The table below sets forth the established target bonus award levels for our named executive officers.

[END TABLE]
Overview
At the beginning of each annual performance period, the Compensation Committee approves the financial performance metrics and reviews the strategic goals that will be considered when determining the ultimate amount of the performance-based annual incentive bonuses upon completion of the year, including establishing specific targets, thresholds and maximums for each specific performance criteria. The specific targets, thresholds and maximums related to the financial level of goal achievement required are set forth in the tables below. Performance below the threshold would result in no payout related to the financial metrics. For 2018, financial performance metrics were given a weighting of 70% and strategic metrics were given a weighting of 30%.
The financial metrics are measured based on the financial performance achieved by each of the Reporting Segments (i.e., Insurance, Reinsurance and Mortgage (collectively the "underwriting units") and the investment unit) under our existing incentive compensation formula plans. Such plans typically base payouts on the achievement of ROE targets, reflecting the rate of return we earn on our capital and surplus, which supports our goal of growth in tangible book value per share and aligns our executives' compensation with shareholder returns. At the beginning of each underwriting year, the ROE scale, which establishes the threshold, target and maximum levels, is approved by the Compensation Committee. The  threshold and maximum levels have been a consistent percentage of the target level over time. These percentages as well as the 2018 underwriting year ROE scale are set forth in the table below.
Under the formula plans, for underwriting units, bonus payouts are determined based on the unit's performance during the current calendar year across all open underwriting years (typically the last 10 years), evaluated against the applicable ROE scale and target developed for each such underwriting year and applied over its respective development period (again, typically 10 years). For the investment unit, bonus awards are derived from the unit's performance as measured by our investment returns compared to the applicable benchmark index over the past one, three and five years.

 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | 37 
[END TABLE]
Strategic goals are designed to incentivize participants to achieve corporate objectives that cannot be measured by financial metrics and are approved by the Compensation Committee each year. Performance against strategic goals is evaluated during the first quarter of the following year. The strategic goals for each of our named executive officers for 2018 are discussed below under "2018 Compensation Decisions for Named Executive Officers."
Performance Criteria 
The following performance criteria and weights apply for corporate and unit executives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Corporate executives are senior-level executives that have a broad set of responsibilities across the entire group and do not have specific underwriting unit profit and loss responsibilities. This group includes the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Unit executives are senior-level executives with profit and loss responsibilities for a specific underwriting unit. In 2018, this group included Mr. Papadopoulo, Mr. Rajeh and Mr. Rippert. 
[END TABLE]
Corporate executives' 70% financial performance metric weighting is based on overall group performance, while the unit executives' 70% financial metric weighting is based 50% on the results of the formula plan for the executive's unit and 20% on overall group performance. For unit executives, a 20% weight on overall group financial performance is used to further incentivize them to support overall group objectives.
The chart below summarizes the performance criteria structure.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Criteria Measurement Weights for Corporate Executives Weights for Unit  ExecutivesRange of Payout Percentages 
Performance Criteria Measurement Weights for Corporate Executives Weights for Unit  ExecutivesRange of Payout Percentages 
Financial Metrics— Group Level  The incentive compensation payout level at the group level is based on each of the underwriting units' incentive compensation formula plan multiples as described in "Overview" above.  In order to calculate a weighted average multiple reflective of the relative contribution of each underwriting unit to the group results, the payout levels for each unit are initially converted to an ROE-equivalent, which is inferred1 using the current underwriting year's ROE scale. Secondly, a group-wide ROE supporting the incentive compensation formula plans is derived, using the unit-specific inferred ROEs, weighted by capital allocated (or deployed) to each underwriting unit. Thirdly, the relative performance of the group is calculated by comparing the group-wide ROE to the target level ROE for the current year.  Ultimately, this result is used in the pre-defined group-level payout scale to generate the incentive payout level under this category.    70% 20% 0–200% 
Financial Metrics—      Segment Level  The incentive compensation payout level for each unit executive measured under this category is equal to his respective unit's incentive compensation formula plan multiple (total bonus payout dollars for the unit for the current year expressed as a percentage of the aggregate target bonus pool for the unit for the current year), as described in "Overview" above.      0% 50% 0–200%

Long-Term Incentive Plan
Overview
The Company grants long-term equity-based incentive awards to link the compensation of our named executive officers directly to corporate performance over the long term and align the interests of executives to our shareholders. A majority of the economic value is granted in performance-based vehicles. The mix of such long-term awards is approximately (i) 80% performance-based, consisting of 55% performance shares and 25% stock options, and (ii) 20% time-based restricted shares. The performance shares are subject to both service-based conditions and performance-based vesting conditions and directly link pay with performance and create shareholder alignment. The stock options also align executives' interests with those of shareholders and focus on driving stock price. Time-based restricted shares promote direct retention and shareholder alignment.
These awards make up a significant component of total direct compensation and we believe that the combination of awards supports our pay-for-performance philosophy by encouraging long-term performance and shareholder value creation.
Long-term incentive awards have historically been made annually in May of each year (February for years beginning in 2019). Grants of performance shares will be made annually, with three-year overlapping cycles. In addition, during the year, additional equity awards may be granted for critical retention situations, newly hired employees, special recognition and promotional reasons. The summary below describes the vesting conditions and other relevant data relating to the annual long-term equity program.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards
The Compensation Committee also endeavored to set rigorous goals for the performance share awards made in May 2018. These awards will payout at target if our tangible book value per share grows at an 11% annual rate over the three-year period. As noted above, the resulting vesting level is secondarily modified by the relative TSR modifier. Earned awards can increase by up to 25% if TSR is greater than or equal to the 65th percentile of the Peer Group, or decrease by up to 25% if TSR is less than or equal to the 35th percentile of the Peer Group. Awards are not modified if TSR performance is between the 35th and 65th percentiles. The maximum number of shares that can be earned is 200% of target. 
The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum performance levels.

[END TABLE]
Other Long-Term Incentive Awards
On April 9, 2018 the Compensation Committee approved a  retention grant for Mr. Grandisson in connection with his promotion to CEO of Arch Capital, which will further align his interests with those of shareholders.  The award was in the form of options to purchase 616,284 shares, with an approximate Black-Scholes value of $4.5 million. The stock options vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first  anniversary of the grant date. The exercise price of $26.79 per share was equal to the fair market value per share on the date of grant. This at-risk compensation will require share price appreciation over an extended period of time in order for Mr. Grandisson to realize any compensation benefit from this award.
In connection with the promotion of Mr. Morin to Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company, on July 24, 2018, he was awarded share-based awards valued at approximately $900,000 in the aggregate, consisting of 55% performance shares, 25% stock options and 20% restricted shares. The performance shares are structured as described above, i.e., with vesting based on growth in tangible book value per share over a three-year performance period with a relative TSR modifier, while the stock options and restricted shares vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
Status of Annual Performance Share Programs
Performance shares that were granted in 2018 have a performance period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. Absolute growth in tangible book value per common share over the remaining years of the performance period (and relative TSR performance) will determine the number of shares earned, if any. Results will be determined on March 10, 2021 including applying the relative shareholder return modifier.

The Compensation Committee also took into account Mr. Rajeh's role in strategic initiatives, including development of the group's platform in Europe, the implementation of a motor center of excellence, raising the profile of predictive analytics and identifying fertile ground for implementing predictive analytics.

■  Base Salary Mr. Rajeh did not receive a salary adjustment in 2018.   
■  Short-Term Cash Incentive The group level of goal achievement during 2018 for the open underwriting years was 126%, which resulted in a payout factor of 200% of target for the group financial goal portion of bonuses. The level of goal achievement during 2018 under the formula plan for the open underwriting years under the reinsurance segment was 101%, which resulted in a payout factor of 101%1of target for the segment financial goal portion of bonuses. The Compensation Committee reviewed Mr. Rajeh's performance against the stated strategic metrics established, which resulted in a performance multiplier of 150% on the portion of his bonus that was based on strategic performance.

 1    The total long-term incentive value provided in the summary above for the May 11, 2018 awards differs from the grant date fair value reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation and 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Tables. The values in the summary above were based on an estimated share price ahead of the grant date. The values in the Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Tables were determined at the grant date and, in the case of the performance shares, based on a Monte Carlo Simulation methodology instead of the target amount shown in the summary above. In both cases the stock options are valued based on the Black-Scholes option pricing methodology and restricted shares are valued based on the closing price of our common shares.

[END TABLE]
Additional Compensation Policies and Practices
Arch Capital's compensation philosophy and related governance features are also complemented by several specific elements that are designed to align our compensation with long-term shareholder interests. These elements include the following:
Clawback Policy
The Company has a clawback policy covering all executive officers, including the chief executive officer. This policy provides that, in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Compensation Committee will review all incentive-based compensation that was paid to current or former executive officers during the three-year period preceding the required restatement. If any such incentive-based compensation would have been lower as a result of the restated financial results, the Compensation Committee will require the reimbursement of the incremental portion of the incentive-based compensation in excess of the compensation that would have been paid based on the restated financial results (to the extent permitted by applicable law). This policy will be interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of NASDAQ (or other securities exchange on which our common shares are listed from time to time).
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups
The Company does not provide excise tax gross-up payments to any of its executives in connection with change in control payments. 
No Tax Gross-Ups
The Company does not include tax gross-up provisions in employment agreements and does not provide tax gross-ups to our named executive officers. 
Share Ownership Guidelines
In an effort to further align the interests of the senior management team with the interests of shareholders, the Company has share ownership guidelines that require these executives to maintain designated levels of ownership of the common shares of Arch Capital. Specifically, these guidelines require common share ownership levels as follows: (1) chief executive officer of Arch Capital—six times base salary; (2) named executive officers and other executives who file reports under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and certain other members of senior management designated from time to time—four times base salary; and (3) other designated members of senior operating management—three times base salary. Each executive has five years to comply with the guidelines, and
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | 47 
[END TABLE]
stock options, SARs and unvested restricted shares/units do not count toward the requirement. See also "Director Compensation—Matters Relating to Director Share Ownership" for a description of share ownership guidelines that require our non-employee directors to maintain designated levels of ownership of common shares of Arch Capital.
Share Holding Requirements for Executives
To ensure each of our senior executives meets our share ownership guidelines, the Company requires each senior executive retain 50% of the net profit shares received from Company equity awards until the executive meets target ownership levels. Net profit shares are the shares remaining after payment of the exercise price of an option and taxes owed on exercise of options or SARs, vesting of restricted stock or vesting and payout under restricted stock units and performance shares. See also "Director Compensation—Matters Relating to Director Share Ownership" for a description of share retention guidelines that require our non-employee directors to maintain designated levels of ownership of common shares of Arch Capital. 
No Hedging Permitted
As part of our Code of Business Conduct, our officers, directors and other employees are not permitted to engage in hedging activities with respect to Arch Capital's common stock or any other publicly-traded equity or debt securities issued by Arch Capital or any of its subsidiaries. Specifically, they may not engage in short sales, purchase or sale of financial instruments or derivatives, including puts and calls, that hedge or offset any change in the market value of such securities. In addition, our officers, directors and other employees may not otherwise engage in transactions that are designed to, or have, the same effect.
Limits on Pledging
Our Code of Business Conduct discourages the pledging of our common shares as collateral for loans and includes limitations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ In no event may any executive officer or director of the Company pledge an amount of common shares that exceeds the lesser of 30% of the common shares beneficially owned by the individual (as reported or would be reported in our Proxy Statement) or 0.5% of the then outstanding common shares of Arch Capital; and 
▪ any securities pledged would not count toward satisfying any required ownership level of securities under relevant share retention guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
Double-Trigger Change in Control Provision
The equity-based compensation award agreements for the named executive officers provide that, in the event the officer's employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, or by the officer for good reason, within two years following the consummation of a change in control in which the awards are assumed by the acquirer, unvested awards would immediately vest, and the options and SARs would have a remaining term of 90 days from termination.
Options and SARs
Our plans do not permit granting of stock options or SARs at an exercise price below the closing price on the grant date and also do not allow for repricing or reducing the exercise price of a stock option or SAR. We also do not allow out-of-the-money options or SARs to be exchanged for cash or other property. 
Procedures Regarding Share-Based Compensation
The Compensation Committee, or a subcommittee comprised of at least two of its members, approves all grants of share-based compensation to the named executive officers and other executives who file Section 16 reports with the SEC, and these awards have generally also been approved by the full Board. 
The grant date for annual grants of share-based compensation is determined on the dates of regularly scheduled meetings of the full Board to provide assurance that grant timing is not being manipulated for employee gain. Generally, awards are granted to the named executive officers as part of the annual process, which encompassed 752 employees worldwide for awards granted in 2018. We may grant a small percentage of awards at other times throughout the year on the date of regularly scheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee or the full Board in connection with hiring or the promotion of an executive or special retention circumstances. In the case of new hires, the awards have grant dates corresponding to the date the employment commences for the new hire.
Retirement and Benefit Plans 
Our named executive officers participate in retirement and benefit plans provided to other employees. The benefit plans include medical coverage and life and disability insurance. Our health and welfare plans help ensure that the Company has a productive and focused workforce through reliable and competitive healthcare and other benefits. Defined contribution retirement plans are provided for all employees according to local market practice. Retirement plans help employees save and prepare for retirement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
48 |  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Company maintains an Executive Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings and Retirement Plan covering our U.S.-based senior executives which is described under "2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation." Our named executive officers are Bermuda-based and not permitted to participate in the non-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. In lieu of pension and matching contributions through the non-qualified plan, we have provided comparable benefits in the form of current cash payments, which are included in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" in the "All Other Compensation" column.
Other Personal Benefits
The Company provides our named executive officers with perquisites and other benefits that the Company and Compensation Committee believe are reasonable and consistent with market practice in Bermuda to better enable the Company to attract and retain key employees. Such amounts have been included in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" in the "All Other Compensation" column.
Tax Considerations
Section 162(m)
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986m as amended (the "Code") generally limits the deductible amount of annual compensation paid to a "covered employee" (i.e., the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and certain other current or former executive officers) to no more than $1,000,000 each. Since Arch Capital will not generally be subject to United States income tax, the limitation on deductibility will not directly apply to it. However, the limitation would apply to a United States subsidiary of Arch Capital if it employs a covered employee. The Compensation Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that will attract, retain and reward the executive talent necessary to our success. Consequently, the Compensation Committee recognizes that the loss of a tax deduction could be necessary or advisable in some circumstances due to the restrictions of Section 162(m). 
Sections 409A and 457A
Section 409A of the Code, which governs deferred compensation arrangements, generally provides that distributions of deferred compensation to our senior officers as a consequence of termination of employment may not be made sooner than six months after termination and governs the timing of elections and distributions of deferred compensation. In addition, Section 457A of the Code generally prohibits U.S. taxpayers from deferring U.S. income tax on compensation attributable to services performed after December 31, 2008 for certain Bermuda-based employers. As a result, for periods on or after January 1, 2009, certain employees of Arch Capital, including our named executive officers, are no longer permitted to participate in the non-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. In lieu of pension and matching contributions previously provided to these former participants through the non-qualified plan, we provide comparable benefits to these participants in the form of current cash payments subject to taxation. In addition, in light of Section 457A, and in an effort to maintain comparable benefits for all employees, the Company has provided certain of its Bermuda-based employees who are U.S. taxpayers with the opportunity to receive a portion of their annual incentive bonus in the form of stock options or restricted shares. There are no matching or additional Company contributions associated with this election and, as a result, the Company will not incur any additional expense by providing this benefit. 
Report of the Compensation Committee on the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section included in this Proxy Statement with management. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section be included in the 2018 Annual Report and this Proxy Statement for filing with the SEC.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During 2018, the Compensation Committee consisted of Eugene S. Sunshine (chairman), John L. Bunce, Jr., Louis J. Paglia and John M. Pasquesi. 
From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into transactions, including insurance and reinsurance transactions and brokerage or other arrangements for the production of business, with entities in which companies or funds affiliated with directors of Arch Capital may have an ownership or other interest.
Certain of our directors and executive officers acquired shares of Watford at the time of its launch in March 2014 at the same price per share paid by other investors. We own common and preferred interests in Watford and have the right to designate two members of Watford's board of directors. We consolidate Watford's financial results under applicable accounting principles. See "Ownership of Watford Holdings Ltd. Shares" in this Proxy Statement and notes 11, "Variable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests," and 4, "Segment Information," of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report (as defined below) for more information about Watford.
During 2015, a subsidiary of Arch Capital, Arch Reinsurance Company ("Arch Re U.S."), invested $8 million for an approximately 19% equity interest in Sojourner Holding Company LLC, which through its subsidiary Spinnaker Insurance Company ("Spinnaker"), conducts a property-
focused program business. In connection with its investment, the Company has the right to appoint one member of Sojourner's board of managers, and also has a right of first refusal to provide, on market terms, a specified percentage of certain reinsurance purchased by Spinnaker. At the same time, Otter Capital Partners LP ("OCP") invested $10 million on the same economic terms for an approximately 24% equity interest in Sojourner. The general partner of OCP is Otter Capital LLC and John M. Pasquesi, one of Arch Capital's directors, serves as the sole member. Otter Capital also has the right to appoint one member of Sojourner's board of managers. We have a right of first refusal on certain of the business of Spinnaker, and, from time to time, may enter into reinsurance transactions with Spinnaker in the ordinary course of business. Arch Re U.S. entered into a quota share agreement with Spinnaker covering property risks which renewed in 2018 at a 30% share and generated net premiums written and earned of $3.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for 2018. Arch Re U.S. also entered into property catastrophe excess of loss agreements with Spinnaker which renewed in 2018 and generated net premiums written and earned of $1.0 million and $.8 million, respectively, for 2018. Additionally, in November 2016, Arch Re Bermuda entered into a quota share agreement with Spinnaker covering property business, with a 40% share. For the 2018 year, there was no business written through the quota share agreement between Spinnaker and Arch Re Bermuda.

Performance shares, which pay in shares of Arch Capital will vest based upon growth in tangible book value per share over a three-year period. In addition, the performance shares are subject to a TSR modifier. The relative TSR modifier will reduce or increase the amount of shares earned by 25% if TSR over the three-year performance period relative to our peer group falls outside of

a defined range. See "Elements of Compensation Program—2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan" for more information about the relative TSR modifier. Assuming the highest level of performance is achieved, the grant date fair value of the performance shares would be Mr. Grandisson—$4,065,280; Mr. Morin—$1,868,271; Mr. Papadopoulo —$1,355,093; Mr. Rajeh—$1,174,483; and Mr. Rippert— $1,264,714.

 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | 57 
[END TABLE]
The Company maintains an Executive Supplemental Non-Qualified Savings and Retirement Plan. Under this plan, participants may defer eligible base salary in excess of the compensation limit imposed by the Code ("Excess Compensation") (for 2018, base salary in excess of $275,000) and, with respect to the eligible named executive officers, the Company provides matching contributions on these deferrals in amounts equal to 100% of the first 3% of salary contributed to the plan and 50% of the next 3% of salary contributed to the plan. The Company also makes pension-like contributions on behalf of the eligible named executive officers in an amount equal to 10% of Excess Compensation. In addition, the eligible named executive officers may defer up to 100% of annual bonus paid each year and these bonus deferral contributions are not eligible for matching contributions by the Company. Until distribution, the contributions and any earnings are held in an irrevocable trust known as a "rabbi trust" by an independent trustee, and the trust assets remain subject to the Company's creditors. The participants may elect to have their contributions under the plan deemed to be invested among certain permissible mutual fund options. The plan provides that, as soon as practicable following retirement, death or other termination of employment, but subject to any delay required by the Code, all benefits under the plan will be distributed either in a single lump sum in cash or, if elected, in installments over a period not to exceed 10 years.
Section 457A of the Code generally prohibits U.S. taxpayers from deferring U.S. income tax on compensation attributable to services performed after December 31, 2008 for certain Bermuda-based employers. As a result, for periods on or after January 1, 2009, certain employees of Arch Capital and Arch Re Bermuda, including Messrs. Grandisson, Morin, Papadopoulo, Rajeh, Rippert and Iordanou are no longer permitted to participate in the non-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. In lieu of pension and matching contributions previously provided to these former participants through the non-qualified plan, we have provided comparable benefits to these participants in the form of current cash payments, subject to tax. Such cash payments have been included in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" in the "All Other Compensation" column for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(1) In the case of resignation by giving six months' advance notice without good reason by Messrs. Grandisson, Morin, Papadopoulo, Rajeh or Rippert, the Company may elect to place them on "garden  
[END TABLE]
leave" during all or part of the notice period. In this event, each of these individuals will (a) continue to receive base salary and benefits through the garden leave period of up to six months, and (b) receive, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | 59 
[END TABLE]
following the end of the garden leave period, a cash lump sum payment equal to one half of the sum of (i) the "bonus amount" (which is the greater of the annual target bonus or the average of the annual bonuses received for the preceding three years) and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the "bonus amount" through the date of notice (in the case of Mr. Grandisson, through the date of termination, less any period of garden leave). If the Company does not elect to place them on garden leave, and these individuals continue to work during the six month notice period, they will be entitled to receive the amounts set forth in the preceding sentence pursuant to their employment agreement. See "Employment Arrangements." For a termination date of December 31, 2018, the total of these cash amounts accruing from the notice date would have been $2.7 million for Mr. Grandisson, $0.9 million for Mr. Morin, $2.5 million for Mr. Papadopoulo, $1.3 million for Mr. Rajeh and $1.0 million for Mr. Rippert. In addition, if the Company elects to extend their noncompetition period for six months after the end of the notice or garden leave period, Messrs. Grandisson, Morin, Papadopoulo, Rajeh and Rippert will (a) continue to receive base salary and medical benefits through the extended noncompetition period and (b) receive, during the extended noncompetition period, payments in the aggregate equal to one half of the sum of (i) the "bonus amount" and (ii) a pro-rated portion of the "bonus amount" through the date of notice of termination. For a termination date of December 31, 2018, and a six month extension of the noncompetition period, the total of these cash amounts would have been $2.7 million for Mr. Grandisson, $0.9 million for Mr. Morin, $2.5 million for Mr. Papadopoulo, $1.3 million for Mr. Rajeh and $1.0 million for Mr. Rippert.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Since Messrs. Papadopoulo, Rippert, and Iordanou are of retirement age (as defined in our plans), any unvested restricted shares/units and unvested stock options/SARs will continue to vest according to the vesting schedule and, in the case of stock options/SARs, the options/SARs will continue to have the full exercise period of 10 years from the date of grant, so long as they do not engage in a competitive activity (as defined in the applicable award agreements). In the event the executives engage in a competitive activity following retirement, unvested awards will be forfeited and the exercise periods for vested options/SARs would be reduced.  
(3) Since Mr. Rippert is of retirement age (as defined in our plans), if Mr. Rippert retired on December 31, 2018, he would have been entitled to payments in full settlement under the Formula Approach as described in footnote 4 below, provided he did not engage in  competition with the Company. 
(4) Messrs. Rajeh and Rippert participated under the Formula Approach of our Incentive Compensation Plan for underwriting years through 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the event of termination on December 31, 2018 due to death, termination without cause or termination for good reason, Messrs. Rajeh and Rippert would have been entitled to payments in full settlement under the Formula Approach in the amounts determined by the Compensation Committee, taking into account such factors it deems relevant including that such amounts are generally subject to recalculation over the applicable 10-year development periods for open underwriting years. As of December 31, 2018, such amounts for Messrs. Rajeh and Rippert are estimated to be up to approximately $4.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Any such payments would be made by the end of the year following termination. 
(5) Upon termination on December 31, 2018, due to disability, Messrs. Rajeh and Rippert would have been entitled to payments in full settlement under the Formula Approach as described in footnote 9 below, provided they did not engage in competition with the Company. 
(6) Under Mr. Grandisson's Employment Agreement, in the event of his death, his estate would receive an amount equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and his target annual bonus. Such  
[END TABLE]
amount would be paid in a lump sum and offset by the amount of any proceeds received by his estate from life insurance provided by the Company.  The amount set forth above reflects an offset of $1.0 million for life insurance coverage currently provided by the Company. 
Under Mr. Grandisson's Employment Agreement, in the event his employment terminates due to his permanent disability, he would be entitled to payment of an amount equal to 40% of his base salary through the date he reaches age 65, offset by proceeds scheduled to be received from any disability insurance coverages provided by the Company.  The disability insurance coverage currently provided by the Company exceeds the amount otherwise payable by the Company. 
Under Mr. Grandisson's Employment Agreement, in the event his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by him for good reason, he would be entitled to (i) base salary for the number of months equal to the excess of 24 months over the number of months, if any, he is on garden leave (during which he would continue to receive base salary), (ii) two times his target annual bonus and (iii) a pro-rated portion of his target annual bonus based on the period through the date of termination, less any period he is on garden leave.  
The amounts above assume a termination date of December 31, 2018, a notice of termination date of June 30, 2018 and a six month garden leave period between the notice and termination dates. The amounts include base salary payable during the garden leave period.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7) Represents the intrinsic value (i.e., the value based upon the Company's closing share price on December 31, 2018 or in the case of stock options/SARs, the excess of the closing price over the exercise price) of accelerated vesting of certain unvested share-based awards as of December 31, 2018 under the various circumstances presented. 
(8) Represents the employer cost relating to the continuation of medical insurance coverage under the terms described in each executive's employment agreement for the various circumstances presented. 
(9) In the case of termination by the Company without cause or by Messrs. Morin, Papadopoulo, Rajeh or Rippert for good reason, each will be entitled to receive twelve months of base salary from the date of notice of termination and an amount equal to the sum of the (i) the annual target bonus plus (ii) a pro-rated portion of the annual target bonus through the date of notice, one half of which amount shall be paid in a single lump sum on the date that is sixty days following the date of termination and the remaining half will be payable in equal monthly installments over six months following the date of termination. 
(10) In the case of termination (i) due to death, (ii) disability, (iii) by the Company without cause or (iii) by the executive for good reason, Mr. Iordanou (or his estate) would have been entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of the total remaining base compensation and target annual bonus which would have been paid through six months after the date of termination, with such amounts payable in six equal installments. In the case of death, the payment would be offset by the amount of any proceeds received by his estate from life insurance provided by the Company ($650,000 until age 70, and will decrease to $500,000 after age 70). In the case of termination due to permanent disability, the payment would be offset by proceeds scheduled to be received from any disability insurance coverages provided by the Company. The amount payable due to disability set forth above has been reduced by $333,360, the amount he would have received under Company provided disability coverages.  
(11) Mr. Lyons resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective on May 25, 2018. Mr. Lyons received his base salary through the effective date of his resignation, his vested benefits were paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan and his unvested equity awards were forfeited.

Pay Ratio
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO relative to the median of the annual total compensation of our employees. We identified the median employee from among our global employee population (excluding the CEO) as of December 31, 2018. Our global employee population included all of our full-time and part-time employees who were employed on December 31, 2018.
CEO Pay Ratio—99 to 1
We determined each employee's consistently applied compensation measure which was equal to the sum of the following pay components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ 2018 base salary; 
▪ bonuses paid during 2018; 
▪ variable incentive compensation paid during 2018; and  
▪ the fair value of all equity grants made during 2018. 
[END TABLE]
We annualized the 2018 base salary for full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. Amounts paid in currencies other than U.S. dollars were converted into U.S. dollars based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2018. 
Based on each employee's consistently applied compensation measure, we were able to identify the median employee who was a full-time, permanent employee based in the United States.
After identifying the median employee, we calculated the median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 using the same requirements applied to calculate our CEO annual total compensation as set forth in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table", and then added the estimated value of the median employee's health plan benefits.
Based on the foregoing, the annual total compensation calculated for the median employee for 2018 was $126,070. For purposes of the pay ratio rule, the annual total compensation calculated for our CEO for 2018, was $12,432,827, as set forth in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table", plus $34,579, the estimated value of our CEO's health plan benefits, or $12,467,406. 
Accordingly, for 2018, our CEO to median employee pay ratio was 99 to 1.
Employment Arrangements
Set forth below is a summary of the material terms of the employment arrangements with each of the named executive officers.
Marc Grandisson 
Mr. Grandisson's employment agreement provides for annual base salary of $1,000,000 and eligibility to participate in an annual bonus plan with a target of 165% of his annual base salary and other terms set by the Board. Mr. Grandisson is entitled to participate in employee benefit programs and other fringe benefits customarily provided to similarly situated senior executives residing in Bermuda, which include housing expenses and automobile allowance.
Mr. Grandisson's employment period under the employment agreement will end on the first to occur of: (a) the six month anniversary of our providing notice of termination without cause to him; (b) immediately upon our providing notice of termination for cause to him; (c) the six month anniversary of Mr. Grandisson providing notice of termination specifying his resignation with or without good reason (as defined in the employment agreement); (d) the fifth day following our providing notice of termination to him as a result of his permanent disability; and (e) the date of his death. The first of such dates is referred to as the "date of termination."
The agreement provides that if the employment of Mr. Grandisson is terminated by us without cause or by him for good reason, he will be entitled to receive his annual base salary through the date of termination.

If Mr. Grandisson's employment is terminated as a result of his resignation other than for good reason, he will continue to receive base salary and employee benefits through the date of termination, and we will make a cash lump sum payment to him equal to one half of the sum of (I) his "bonus amount" (which is the greater of (i) his target annual bonus for the year during which notice of termination is given, or (ii) the average of his actual annual bonus for the three years immediately preceding the year during which notice of termination is given), and (II) a pro-rated portion of the bonus amount based on the number of days elapsed in the calendar year through the date of termination (less any period he is on "garden leave"), which payment will be made sixty days following termination.
If Mr. Grandisson's employment is terminated by us for cause, he will receive base salary and employee benefits through the date of termination. In the case of termination due to his death, his beneficiaries or estate will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary and target annual bonus, offset by proceeds of life insurance coverages provided by us. In the case of termination due to his permanent disability, he will receive an amount per annum equal to forty percent of his annual base salary until he reaches age sixty-five, offset by proceeds scheduled to be received by him from any disability insurance provided by us, and any payments scheduled to be made after the first anniversary of termination will be made on such first anniversary. In the case of termination due to his permanent disability or death, he and/or his dependents will also receive major medical insurance coverage benefits for a period of up to twelve months after the date of termination.
Following any notice of termination, whether by us or Mr. Grandisson, and until the date of termination, we may direct, in our sole and exclusive discretion, that Mr. Grandisson perform no duties and exercise no powers or authorities in connection with his employment. However, following any such direction, Mr. Grandisson will continue to have a duty of loyalty to us as an employee through the date of termination. This is referred to as a "garden leave" period.
Mr. Grandisson has agreed that, during the employment period and for the period of one year after the date of termination, he will not compete with us. However, if Mr. Grandisson's termination of employment occurs as a result of his resignation other than for good reason, the noncompetition period will continue beyond the date of termination only if (i) we pay Mr. Grandisson, for each day during which the noncompetition period so continues, an amount equal to 1/365th of the sum of (A) his annual base salary, plus (B) the bonus amount (as defined above), and (C) a pro-rated portion of his bonus amount based on the number of days elapsed in the calendar year through the date notice of termination is given; and (ii) he continues to receive his major medical insurance coverage for a period up to the end of the noncompetition period. Our obligation to make such payments and provide such benefits is contingent on Mr. Grandisson's delivery of a general release of claims and his compliance with the restrictive covenants. Mr. Grandisson has also agreed not to solicit our employees or customers for a period of one year following termination. The lengths of the noncompetition and nonsolicitation periods will be reduced by any period that Mr. Grandisson is on garden leave, as described above.

The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence. The Audit Committee approves all audit and permissible non-audit services performed for us by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees compared to the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee delegates pre-approval authority to one or more of its independent members. To the extent applicable, the member to whom such authority is delegated reports, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     Shareholders Entitled to Vote and Voting Standard 
[END TABLE]
Our Board set March 8, 2019 as the record date for the meeting. This means that shareholders as of the close of business on that date are entitled to receive this notice of the annual meeting and vote at the annual meeting and any and all postponements or adjournments of the annual meeting. 
On the record date, there were 403,518,712 common shares outstanding and entitled to vote, subject to our bye-laws (described below). At that date, there were an estimated 867 holders of record and approximately 48,255 beneficial holders of the common shares. Each holder of record of shares on the record date is entitled to cast one vote per share, subject to the limitations described below. Only holders of the Company's common shares may vote at the annual meeting. The Company's outstanding preferred shares have no voting rights (except in very limited circumstances which do not currently apply). 
How to Vote
You are encouraged to vote in advance of the annual meeting, even if you are planning to attend in person.
You can use any of the following methods listed to vote. Make sure you have your Notice, proxy card or Voting Instruction Form in hand and follow the instructions.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  | A-1 
[END TABLE]
Registered Shareholders
Shareholders who hold their shares directly with our stock registrar, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, can vote any one of several ways.
 Via the Internet: Visit www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions on the website. 
If you vote via the Internet or by phone, your voting instructions may be transmitted until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019. See "Arch Capital Employee Share Purchase Plan" below for voting instructions regarding shares held under our share purchase plan.
 By Phone: Call 1-800-690-6903 and follow the voice prompts. 
 By Mail: Sign, date and return the proxy card.
 By QR Code: Scan the QR Code on your proxy card, Notice or Voting Instruction Form to vote with your mobile device. 
 In Person: Attend the annual meeting, or send a personal representative with an appropriate proxy, to vote by ballot at the meeting (see below "Annual Meeting Attendance").
Beneficial Shareholders
Shareholders who hold their shares beneficially through an institutional holder of record such as a bank or broker (sometimes referred to as holding shares "in street name"), will receive voting instructions from that holder of record. If you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the holder of record of your shares and present it at the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Quorum; Votes Required for Approval 
[END TABLE]
The presence of two or more persons representing, in person or by proxy, including proxies properly submitted by mail, telephone or Internet, at least a majority of the voting power of our shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present, the annual meeting may be adjourned until a quorum is obtained. The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares represented at the annual meeting will be required for approval of each of the proposals, except for Item 1 as described below and Item 2, which is advisory and does not have a required vote. 
With respect to Item 1, in any uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast will be required to elect each director. In the event of a director election in which the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast for such directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in such election will be obligated to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee or other Committee designated by our Board will consider any such resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board would then be required to accept or reject the resignation within 90 days following certification of the election results, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, and would publicly disclose its reasons if the resignation is not accepted.
An automated system administered by our distribution and tabulation agent will tabulate votes cast by proxy at the annual meeting, and our inspector will tabulate votes cast in person. Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., shares held by a broker which are represented at the meeting but with respect to which such broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular proposal) will be counted for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum exists. Abstentions will not be considered in determining the number of votes necessary for approval of Item 1 and will be considered in determining the number of votes necessary for approval of Items 3 and 4.
Several of our officers and directors will be present at the annual meeting and available to respond to questions. Our independent auditors are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Effect of Your Proxy 
[END TABLE]
Your proxy authorizes another person to vote your shares on your behalf at the Annual Meeting.
If your valid proxy is received by Internet, telephone or mail before the deadline, the persons designated as proxies will vote your shares per your directions. We have designated two of our officers as proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders—Marc Grandisson and Martin Richardson.
Should any other matter not referred to in this Proxy Statement properly come before the meeting, the designated proxies will vote in their discretion. If any Director nominee should refuse or be unable to serve, an event that is not anticipated, your shares will be voted for the person designated by the Board to replace such nominee or, alternatively, the Board may reduce the number of Directors on the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Effect of Not Casting Your Vote 
[END TABLE]
Registered Shareholders
When a valid proxy is received, but specific choices are not indicated, the designated proxies will vote as recommended by the Board.
Beneficial Shareholders
It is critical that you cast your vote if you want it to count in the election of directors and most other items on the agenda. Under applicable regulations, if you hold your shares beneficially and do not instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record on how to vote your shares, the holder of record will only have discretion to vote your uninstructed shares on the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (Item 3). The holder of record will not have discretion to vote your uninstructed shares on the election of three Class III directors (Item 1), the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation (Item 2) or the election of certain individuals as Designated Company Directors of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, as required by our bye-laws (Item 4), resulting in "broker non-votes" on those items.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Revoking Your Proxy or Changing Your Vote 
[END TABLE]
You may change your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised.
Registered Shareholders
If you voted by mail, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by executing and delivering a timely and valid later-dated proxy, by voting by ballot at the meeting or by giving written notice to the Secretary. If you voted via the Internet or by phone, you may change your vote with a timely and valid later Internet or telephone vote, or by voting by ballot at the meeting.
Attendance at the meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless (1) you give proper written notice of revocation to the Secretary before the proxy is exercised, or (2) you vote by ballot at the meeting.
Beneficial Shareholders
Follow the specific directions provided by your bank, broker or other holder of record to change or revoke any voting instructions you have already provided. Alternatively, you may vote your shares by ballot at the meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your holder of record and present it at the meeting.

     Limitation on Voting Under Our Bye-laws 
[END TABLE]
Under our bye-laws, if the votes conferred by shares of the Company, directly or indirectly or constructively owned (within the meaning of Section 958 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), by any U.S. person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) would otherwise represent more than 9.9% of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, the votes conferred by such shares or such U.S. person will be reduced, subject to certain exceptions, by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by the shares of such person will constitute 9.9% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. There may be circumstances in which the votes conferred on a U.S. person are reduced to less than 9.9% as a result of the operation of our bye-laws because of shares that may be attributed to that person under the Code. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of our bye-laws described above, after having applied such provisions as best as they consider reasonably practicable, the Board may make such final adjustments to the aggregate number of votes conferred by the shares of any U.S. person that they consider fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that such votes represent 9.9% of the aggregate voting power of the votes conferred by all shares of Arch Capital entitled to vote generally at an election of directors.
In order to implement our bye-laws, we will assume that all shareholders are U.S. persons unless we receive assurances satisfactory to us that they are not U.S. persons.

Proxies are being solicited by and on behalf of the Board. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, phone, telegram and facsimile, in each case by our directors, officers and employees.
We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies and verify records related to the solicitation for a fee of approximately $12,500 plus expenses. We will reimburse brokerage houses, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials. We may request by phone, facsimile, mail, electronic mail or other means the return of the proxy cards.

     Reduce Duplicate Mailings 
[END TABLE]
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, registered shareholders, who have the same address and last name and who receive either Notices or paper copies of the proxy materials in the mail, will receive only one copy of our proxy materials, or a single envelope containing the Notices for all shareholders at that address. This consolidated method of delivery will continue unless one or more of these shareholders notifies us that they would like to receive individual copies of proxy materials. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards or Notices that include each shareholder's unique control number for voting the shares held in each account.
Registered Shareholders who wish to discontinue householding and receive separate copies of proxy materials may notify Broadridge by calling 1-866-540-7095, or send a written request to the Company's Secretary at the address of our principal office.
Beneficial Shareholders may request information about householding from your bank, broker or other holder of record.

For any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement (as described in the preceding paragraph) but is instead sought to be presented directly at next year's annual meeting, the rules of the SEC permit management to vote proxies in its discretion if we do not receive notice of the proposal on or before the deadline for advance notice set forth in our bye-laws as described below. 
Our bye-laws provide that any shareholder desiring to make a proposal or nominate a director at an annual meeting must provide written notice of such proposal or nomination to the Secretary of the Company at least 50 days prior to the date of the meeting at which such proposal or nomination is proposed to be voted upon (or, if less than 55 days' notice of an annual meeting is given, shareholder proposals and nominations must be delivered no later than the close of business of the seventh day following the day notice was mailed). Any such proposal or nomination must include the information required under our bye-laws with respect to each proposal or nomination and the shareholder making such proposal or nomination.
A shareholder proponent must be a shareholder of the Company who was a shareholder of record both at the time of giving of notice and at the time of the meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting.

ANNEX B—NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In presenting our results for purposes of compensation determinations, we include and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.
After-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders is defined as net income available to Arch common shareholders, excluding net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses recognized in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses, transaction costs and other, loss on redemption of preferred shares and income taxes. The table below presents the reconciliation of net income available to Arch common shareholders to after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders.
Annualized operating return on average common equity ("Operating ROE") represents after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders divided by average common shareholders' equity during the period. Management uses Operating ROE as a key measure of the return generated to our common shareholders. 
The following table summarizes our consolidated financial data, including a reconciliation of net income available to Arch common shareholders to after-tax operating income available to Arch common shareholders. Each line item reflects the impact of our approximate 11% ownership of Watford's common equity.

Tangible book value per common share represents common shareholders' equity available to Arch less goodwill and intangible assets (including the impact of our approximate 11% ownership of Watford's goodwill). We believe that tangible book value per common share is useful to investors because it provides a more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder returns, excluding the impact of goodwill and intangible assets. The following table provides a reconciliation of book value per common share to tangible book value per common share:

Underwriting income represents the pre-tax profitability of our underwriting operations and includes net premiums earned plus other underwriting income, less losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and other operating expenses. Other operating expenses include those operating expenses that are incremental and/or directly attributable to our individual underwriting operations. Underwriting income or loss does not incorporate items included in the our corporate (non-underwriting) segment. Refer to note 4 (Segment Information) to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a reconciliation of underwriting income to net income.
