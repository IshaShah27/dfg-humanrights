ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS Thursday, November 8, 2018
​
I.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
​
Q:
Why am I receiving these materials? 
​
A:
The Board of Directors of Allied Healthcare Products, Inc. (the "Company", "we" or "our") provides you these materials to solicit your proxy in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and any and all adjournments thereof. You are encouraged to vote on the proposals presented in these proxy materials. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, but you do not need to attend to vote. The Company first mailed these materials on October 5, 2018. 
​
Q:
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
We will hold the Annual Meeting on Thursday, November 8, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time at our corporate headquarters, located at 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110. 
​
Q:
What information is contained in this Proxy Statement? 
​
A:
The information in this Proxy Statement relates to matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting of stockholders, our corporate governance, the compensation of our directors and most highly paid executive officers and other required disclosures. 
​
Q:
Can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
​
A:
These proxy materials, including our 2018 annual report to stockholders are available at www.alliedhpi.com.
​
Q:
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
Stockholders of record at the close of business on Monday, October 1, 2018 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on that date, there were outstanding and entitled to vote 4,013,537 shares of common stock, each of which is entitled to one vote. No cumulative voting rights exist under the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. For information regarding the ownership of the Company's Common Stock by holders of more than five percent of the outstanding shares and by the management of the Company, see "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management." 
​
Q:
How do I vote my shares? 
​
A:
If you are a stockholder of record and you attend the meeting, you may vote by ballot. 
​
Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may also direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card. 
Q:
How do I vote if my shares are held in "street name?" 
​
A:
If you hold your shares in "street name," (i.e., you hold the shares through a broker, bank or other intermediary), as opposed to holding them "of record," you will receive a form from your broker or bank seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. If you desire to vote shares held in street name in person at the meeting, you need to contact your broker or intermediary and ask how to obtain a "legal proxy" to directly vote such shares. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What am I voting on? 
​
A:
The matters to be voted upon this year are: (i) the election of our Board of Directors, (ii) ratification and approval of RubinBrown LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019, and (iii) an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve our executive compensation, as disclosed in this proxy statement. Common stockholders may also vote on any other matter that is properly brought before the meeting. 
​
Q:
Who are the nominees for directors? 
​
A:
We have five directors who are standing for election. We provide biographical information for each director in this Proxy Statement. 
​
Q:
How does the Board recommend I vote? 
​
A:
Our Board recommends that you vote your shares "FOR" each of the nominees to the Board and "FOR" Agenda Items 2 and 3. 
​
Q:
How will my employee stock purchase plan shares be voted? 
​
A:
Shares of Common Stock held by participants in Allied Healthcare's employee stock purchase plans will be voted in accordance with instructions provided on a separate card given to participants in such plans. 
​
Q:
What is the voting requirement to approve the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
The election of directors at the Annual Meeting will be determined on the basis of the five candidates receiving the highest pluralities of votes cast at the Annual Meeting. 
​
Adoption of the proposals in Items 2 and 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Annual Meeting. 
Q:
How are votes counted? 
​
A:
If you hold shares in street name through a broker or other nominee and do note vote your shares or provide voting instructions, your broker may vote for you on "routine" proposals but not on "non-routine" proposals. The ratification of the Company's auditor is considered routine, but the election of directors and each of the other proposals are non-routine. Therefore, if you do not vote or provide voting instructions regarding the election of directors or the other non-routine proposals, your broker will not be allowed to vote your shares on such proposals. This will result in a broker non-vote. Broker non-votes are not counted as shares present and entitled to vote so they will not affect the outcome of the election for directors (Item 1) or the non-binding vote on our executive compensation (Item 3). 
​
If you indicate that you wish to "abstain," your vote will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum and present at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposals in Items 2 and 3. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the election of directors since the nominees are elected by a plurality of votes cast. If you withhold your vote with respect to any or all nominees for director, your vote will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum but will not be counted as a vote for election of the director or directors. 
Q:
What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
We are not aware of any business other than the election of directors and the ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the person(s) named as proxy holder(s) will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What if I vote and then change my mind as to how I want to vote or want to revoke my proxy? 
​
A:
If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote by granting a new proxy bearing a later date, by providing our Secretary with written notice of revocation of your proxy, or by attending the meeting and casting your vote in person. To change or revoke your vote for shares you hold in street name, you will need to follow the instructions in the materials your broker or bank provides you. 
​
Q:
Whom may I call with questions about the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
For information about your stock ownership, or for other stockholder services, please contact Stockholder Relations at 314-771-2400, extension 604. For information about the meeting itself, please contact Daniel C. Dunn, our Secretary, at 314-771-2400. 
​
Q:
What should I do if I receive more than one proxy card? 
​
A:
If you hold shares in more than one account you will receive a proxy card for each account. It is important that you vote shares represented by each proxy card you receive.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
II.
AGENDA ITEM 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
​
The Company's Board of Directors is comprised of a single class. The directors are elected at the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company and each director elected holds office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. The Board currently consists of five members. The stockholders will vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting for the election of all five directors for the one-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019. There are no family relationships among any directors or executive officers of the Company. 
The persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote for the election of the nominees named below unless authority to vote is withheld. All nominees have consented to serve if elected. In the event that any of the nominees should be unable to serve, the persons named in the proxy will vote for such substitute nominee or nominees as they, in their discretion, shall determine. The Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any nominee named herein will be unable to serve. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES NAMED BELOW. IF YOU SIGN AND RETURN THE PROXY CARD AND DO NOT SPECIFY OTHERWISE, WE WILL VOTE YOUR SHARES FOR THE ELECTION OF THE FIVE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW.
The biographies of each of the nominees and continuing directors below contain information regarding the person's service as a director, business experience, director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board to determine that the person should serve as a director for the Company beginning in 2018. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a fixed process for identifying and evaluating potential candidates to be nominees for directors, and there is no fixed set of qualifications that candidates must satisfy to be considered. The Governance and Nominating Committee has the flexibility to consider any factors as it deems appropriate. These factors may include education, diversity, experience in the Company's industry, the interplay of the candidate's experience with that of other members of the Board of Directors, and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board of Directors and to any of the committees of the Board of Directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate nominees for directors submitted by stockholders in the same manner in which it evaluates other director nominees. No stockholder has properly nominated anyone for election as a director at the Annual Meeting.

Board of Director Independence
The Board has determined that each of the current Directors other than Mr. Refsland is independent within the meaning of the Company's director independence standards, which reflect the Nasdaq Stock Market director independence standards, as currently in effect. Furthermore, the Board has determined that each of the members of each of the committees is independent within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Audit Committee) and the Nasdaq Stock Market committee independence standards (Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees).  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Board Risk Oversight — Committee Structure
Board Oversight 
The Board believes that having an independent Chairman of the Board is in the best interest of stockholders. An independent Chairman ensures a greater role for the independent directors in the oversight of the Company and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of the Board. 
The Board is actively involved in overseeing the Company's management of risk. This oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, as described below. The full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board satisfies this responsibility through reports by each committee chair regarding the committee's considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company. 
The Board of Directors of the Company held four meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
The Board of Directors presently maintains a Compensation Committee, an Audit Committee and a Governance and Nominating Committee. While there is no formal policy concerning director attendance at the annual meeting, all members of the Board are encouraged to attend if reasonably able to do so. 
Committee Structure 
The Compensation Committee in fiscal year 2018 consisted of Messrs. Weil, Root, Peck and Madam Graves. This committee reviews and approves the Company's executive compensation policy, reviews and approves decisions concerning management bonuses. The Compensation Committee met once during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 to consider changes to the salaries of Mr. Dunn and Mr. Riley. A copy of the Compensation Committee Charter is available on the Company's website: www.alliedhpi.com. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing management of risks relating to the Company's compensation and benefits systems. To assist it in satisfying these oversight responsibilities, the Committee may retain its own compensation consultant and hold meetings with management and with outside counsel to understand the financial, human resources and stockholder implications of compensation decisions being made. In fiscal year 2018, the Committee did not engage any consultant to provide advice or services related to compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
The Audit Committee in fiscal year 2018 consisted of Messrs. Root, Peck and Madam Graves. The Charter for the Audit Committee is available on the Company's web site: www.alliedhpi.com. This committee recommends engagement of the Company's independent auditors and is primarily responsible for approving the services performed by the Company's independent auditors. This committee is also responsible for reviewing and evaluating the Company's accounting principles and its systems of internal accounting controls and overseeing the management of risks related to these activities. The Audit Committee held three meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Board of Directors has determined that nominees for director should meet all the criteria that have been established by the Board of Directors and the Nomination, Compensation and Governance Committee for board membership and not just have certain specific qualities or skills, such as those that would qualify a nominee as an "audit committee financial expert." Accordingly, the Board of Directors believes that it is not in the best interests of the Company to nominate as a director someone who does not have all the experience, attributes and qualifications sought. The Audit Committee consists of independent directors, each of whom has been selected for the Audit Committee by the Board of Directors based on its determination that they are fully qualified to monitor the performance of management, internal accounting operations and the independent public accountants, and are fully qualified to monitor the disclosures of the Company to the end that they fairly present its financial condition and results of operations. Although one or more of the members of the Audit Committee meets, in the Company's opinion, the SEC definition of an "audit committee financial expert," the Board of Directors has decided not to designate any one of them as such. In addition, the Audit Committee has the ability on its own to retain other independent public accountants or other consultants whenever it deems appropriate. The Board of Directors believes that this is fully equivalent to having an "audit committee financial expert" on the Audit Committee.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Governance and Nominating Committee consists of Messrs. Weil, Root, Peck and Madam Graves. This committee recommends nominees to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee did not hold a meeting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominees submitted by stockholders for inclusion on the recommended list of nominees submitted by the Company and voted on at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders if such nominations were submitted in writing to the Company's headquarters Attention: Governance and Nominating Committee, no later than June 1 in the year of such Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a charter, but in the course of performing its duties, the committee adheres to the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, a copy of which is available on the Company's website: www.alliedhpi.com. 
Compensation of Directors
The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified board members. Each director who is not an employee of the Company is entitled to receive an annual fee of  $20,000 for his services as a director and additional fees of  $1,000 for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and $350 for attendance at each meeting of committees of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee Chairman is entitled to receive an additional annual fee of  $1,000. Directors are also entitled to reimbursement for their expenses in attending meetings. 
In addition to such cash payments, the Company provides the following stock-based incentives. 
1. Upon initial election to the Board, a Director receives an option to purchase 5,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock which vests as to 1,250 shares on the second anniversary and then at a rate of 1,250 shares per year thereafter. 
2. Upon reelection to the Board, each Director receives an option to purchase 500 shares of the Company's Common Stock, which vests in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
3. Upon election or reelection as the chairman of any standing committee of the Board or upon reelection as Chairman of the Board, a Director receives an option to purchase 250 shares of the Company's Common Stock, which vests in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
4. Upon the initial election of a non-employee as Chairman of the Board, a Director receives an option to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company's Common Stock, which vests in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
Director Compensation Table

Indemnification and Limitation of Liability
The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company's directors are not liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties, except under certain circumstances, including breach of the director's duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or any transaction from which the director derived improper personal benefit. The Company's By-laws provide for the indemnification of the Company's directors and officers, to the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. The company also has indemnification agreements with each officer and director providing for contractual indemnification substantially similar in scope to the provisions of the By-Laws. 
III.
AGENDA ITEM 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
​
The Company engaged RubinBrown LLP to audit the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Representatives of RubinBrown LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee has selected RubinBrown LLP to be the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and recommends that the stockholders ratify the appointment of the accounting firm. Although stockholder approval is not required by law, the appointment is submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors in order to give the stockholder a voice in the designation of auditors. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of RubinBrown LLP, the Audit Committee will review the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the resolution is approved, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR ratification of RubinBrown LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
IV.
AGENDA ITEM 3 — ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
​
We are providing our stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve our executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the tabular disclosure regarding compensation of the Company's named executive officers and the narrative disclosure accompanying those tables, all as set forth in the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement. The Company held its last advisory vote regarding how often the Company should include a say-on-pay vote in its proxy materials in 2013. As a result of that vote, the Company's Board determined that we will have such an advisory vote every year. 
The following resolution is submitted for stockholder approval: 
Resolved, that the stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the tabular disclosure regarding compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the narrative disclosure accompanying those tables. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board, however the Board will take the outcome of this vote into consideration in making future executive compensation decisions. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR this resolution. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
​
The following table sets forth information regarding beneficial ownership of our directors and executive officers and all persons known to the Company to be the beneficial owners of more than five percent of the Company's Common Stock as of September 30, 2018, based upon filings by such persons with the SEC under applicable provisions of the federal securities laws. As of the close of business on September 30, 2018, there were 4,013,537 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Shares of common stock subject to options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of September 30, 2018 are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options or warrants for the purposes of computing beneficial ownership of that person but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. To our knowledge, except as set forth in the footnotes to this table and subject to applicable community property laws where applicable, each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such person's name. Except as otherwise indicated, the address of each of the persons in this table is the address of the Company's headquarters.

​
VII.   EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee, composed entirely of non-employee members of the Board of Directors, reviews, recommends and approves changes to the Company's compensation policies and program for the chief executive officer, other senior executives and certain key employees. In addition to the delegated authority in areas of compensation, the Committee administers the Company's stock option plans and agreements and recommends to the Board of Directors annual or other grants to be made in connection therewith. 
In the Committee's discharge of its responsibilities, it considers the compensation, primarily of the chief executive officer and the Company's other executive officers, and sets overall policy and considers in general the basis of the levels of compensation of other key employees. 
Policy and Objectives. 
Recognizing its role as a key representative of the stockholders, the Committee seeks to promote the interests of stockholders by attempting to align management's remuneration, benefits and perquisites with the economic wellbeing of the Company. Basically, the Committee seeks the successful implementation of the Company's business strategy by attracting and retaining talented managers motivated to accomplish these stated objectives. The Committee attempts to be fair and competitive in its views of compensation. Thus, rewards involve both business and individual performance. 
Components of Compensation. 
The Company offers the following compensation and employee benefits to those executive officers whose names appear in the Summary Compensation Table below (collectively, our "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs"): 
Base Salary 
Base salaries for the chief executive officer, as well as other executive officers of the Company, are determined primarily based on performance. Generally, the performance of each executive officer is evaluated annually and salary adjustments are based on various factors including revenue growth, earnings per share improvement, increases in cash flow, new product development, market appreciation for publicly  TABLE OF CONTENTS
traded securities, reduction of debt and personal performance. In addition, the Committee may compare salary data for similar positions in companies that match the Company's size in sales and earnings and utilizes such data as a factor in setting base salaries, including compensation market studies published by Salaries.com or similar service. The Committee approves base salary adjustments for the executive officers, including the chief executive officer. In fiscal year 2018, the Committee approved increases in the annual salary of Mr. Dunn from $216,000 to $226,000 and of Mr. Riley from $195,000 to $225,000. 
Mr. Refsland's Base Salary and Changes.   Mr. Refsland's employment agreement currently calls for an annual base salary of  $429,000 plus participation in incentive awards (in cash or securities) as may be granted in the Board's discretion upon recommendations or approvals by the Compensation Committee. The Annual Salary may be increased in future periods but may not be reduced below $415,000 without Mr. Refsland's consent. 
For potential base salary changes for Mr. Refsland, the Compensation Committee reviews Mr. Refsland's performance. The review includes, but is not necessarily limited to, leadership competencies and other core values, executive retention results, and other contributions toward achievement of the Company's strategic plan and objectives. The Committee also takes into account other considerations such as Mr. Refsland's base salary history and its relationship to that of other NEOs. Except in connection with the negotiation of his employment agreement, Mr. Refsland has not had any direct input to the Compensation Committee relative to increases in his base salary. 
Incentive Compensation 
Cash Incentive Compensation.   To reward achievement of financial performance goals during the fiscal year, the Company may pay cash bonuses to the chief executive officer and other NEOs. The actual amount of any incentive compensation paid to each executive officer is determined subjectively, predicated on an assessment of each participant's relative role in achieving the annual financial objectives of the Company as well as each such person's contributions of a strategic nature in maximizing stockholder value. However, in the past several years, including fiscal 2018, the Committee has not awarded cash incentives to any of its NEOs. 
Stock-Based Incentive Compensation.   The Company's 1999 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Plan") expired in June 30, 2009. The Compensation Committee approved the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan") as a replacement for the 1999 Plan and the stockholders approved the 2009 Plan at the 2009 Annual Meeting. The 2009 Plan authorizes the Company to grant equity based awards in the form of stock options. Officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to participate in the Plan. Our incentive stock plans provide a long-term incentive program for the chief executive officer, other executive officers and certain other key employees. The basic objective of these plans is the specific and solid alignment of executive and stockholder interests by forging a direct relationship between this element of compensation and the stockholders' level of return. These programs represent a desire by the Company to permit executives and other key employees to obtain an ownership position and a proprietary interest in the Company's Common Stock. Awards under our plans are generally made to executive staff upon hiring and are reviewed periodically, but not annually, thereafter. In fiscal year 2018, no grants of stock based incentive were made to any of the Company's NEOs under the 2009 Plan or otherwise. 
We set the grant date of any award made by the Company to be the date of the Board meeting at which such award was approved, and the grant price is determined in a manner which will not subject the Company, the grantee or the compensation at issue to any tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Section 409A will not impose such taxes if the award is priced based on the closing price of our stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of the grant or the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. We do not have a program, plan or practice of timing equity award grants in conjunction with the release of material non-public information. 
Please see the "Option Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table below, and the columns related to equity awards of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below, and the entire Outstanding Equity Awards as of June 30, 2018 table below for more information on the stock based portion of incentive compensation we pay to our NEOs.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Post-Termination Compensation and Benefits 
We maintain a qualified 401(k) savings plan for most salaried employees. Subject to a maximum the IRS sets annually ($18,500 for calendar 2018), participants in our 401(k) savings plan may contribute between 1% and 60% of their compensation to their savings plan accounts. The Company's contribution consists of a 2% match of participants' contributions, currently 2% (on the first 8% of the employee's contribution), and an additional 2% on the participants annual compensation. All contributions vest immediately. At termination, the vested balances under a qualified 401(k) saving plan become available to the terminated participant. 
Unless otherwise provided in the incentive grant agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, an executive must be employed with the Company at the time the measurement is made for the receipt of any incentive awards. An executive who voluntarily terminates employment prior to the measurement date for an award (other than for retirement) forfeits all rights to the award. For executives who voluntarily terminate employment prior to retirement age, unvested grants of stock options are forfeited. 
The Company has entered into agreements with Mr. Refsland, Mr. Dunn, and Mr. Riley granting them payments upon a change of control of the Company. These arrangements are intended to promote stability and continuity of senior management. Information on applicable payments under such agreements for NEOs is contained under the heading "Severance and Change in Control Benefits" below. 
Our incentive stock plans also generally provide that, unless otherwise provided in connection with the specific grant of an option, shares of the Company's stock acquired upon exercise of an option are subject to redemption by the Company at a price equal to the exercise price paid by the grantee in the event that the employee holding such shares, within six (6) months of terminating employment with the Company, commences employment which the Compensation Committee reasonably believes, in its discretion, to be competitive with the Company or in violation of any employment or other agreement between the Company and such employee. This provision is intended to discourage grantees of stock options from going to work for competitors. The Company's redemption right, however, is (a) only applicable to shares acquired upon exercise of the option occurring within six (6) months prior to such grantee's termination of employment with the Company and (b) not applicable if the termination of employment occurs at the election of the employee following a "change of control" of the Company. 
We believe these programs further our goal of attracting and retaining top executive talent, and serve to encourage executives to make long-term career commitments to us. 
Compensation Policies and Practices 
Compensation Recoupment; Adjustments Based On Prior Awards.   As the Company has not paid material incentive compensation in recent years, we do not have a policy that requires the adjustment or recovery of awards or payments made to our executive officers if the performance measures on which such awards or payments were based are restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of an award or payment. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently enacted rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring that stock exchanges adopt rules requiring listed companies to adopt recoupment or "clawback" policies. The Company will evaluate any such requirements when they are finalized and review and revise its policies accordingly. 
Perquisites And Employee Benefits.   We provide our NEOs with certain employee benefits that are generally available to all salaried employees including Company-paid group term life insurance equal to two times annual cash compensation excluding bonuses, Company contributions up to 4% to a 401(k) savings plan, medical and dental plans. In addition, we provide certain of our NEOs with a Company-leased automobile, including automobile insurance, with a total lease value that varies by executive level. We believe these benefits further our goal of attracting and retaining top executive talent.

Executive Employment Agreement
In March 2007, the Company entered into an employment contract with Mr. Refsland. The employment contract was amended and restated in December 2009 to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The agreement was initially for a three-year term, which expired in March 2010, after which point it became subject to annual renewals. 
The agreement provides that Mr. Refsland will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer. The agreement may be terminated by the Company in the event of Mr. Refsland's death or disability or unilaterally with or without "Cause" (as defined in the agreement).  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
In the event of a termination of Mr. Refsland's employment without cause (or in the event that Mr. Refsland terminates employment with "Good Reason" (as defined in the agreement)), Mr. Refsland is entitled to continued compensation at his then annual salary for two years and with entitlement continuation of fringe benefits during that period. "Good Reason" generally includes changes in the scope of his duties or location of employment but also includes (i) the Company's written election not to renew the Employment Agreement and (ii) certain voluntary resignations by Mr. Refsland following a "Change of Control" as defined in the Agreement.

Management has the primary responsibility for preparation of the Company's financial reports, the Company's financial reporting systems, and its internal controls. The Audit Committee is not intended to supersede in any respect management's responsibilities in this regard. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed such financial statements with management and with the Company's independent accountants.

Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation material to beneficial owners of the stock held of record by such persons, and the Company will reimburse such persons for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in so doing. 
Stockholder Proposals For 2019 Annual Meeting
The rules of the SEC currently provide that stockholder proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting must be received at the Company's principal executive office not less than 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the release of the Company's proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the 2018 Annual Meeting to be considered by the Company for possible inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting. We mailed this proxy statement on or around October 5, 2018, so any proposals intended to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company must be received at the Company's principal office on or before June 7, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to such meeting. 
Financial Information
The Company's 2018 Annual Report is being mailed to the stockholders with this Proxy Statement. The 2018 Annual Report incorporates the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (without exhibits), including the financial statements and the financial statement schedules, filed with the SEC. Any record or beneficial stockholder as of October 1, 2018, may request additional copies of this Proxy Statement or the 2018 Annual Report by writing to Allied Healthcare Products, Inc., 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. 
The Company's reports filed with the SEC, together with ownership and transaction reports of officers, directors and certain stockholders, are available, together with additional information, at the Company's internet website: www.alliedhpi.com. 
Communication With The Board
Stockholders who want to communicate with the Board of Directors or any of its committees may do so by addressing their correspondence to the board member or members, c/o the Secretary, Allied Healthcare Products, Inc., 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110. 
Code Of Ethics And Conduct Guidelines
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct Guidelines that is applicable to all employees of the Company, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer and controller, as well as the members of the Board of Directors. The Code of Ethics and Conduct Guidelines is available on the Company's website at www.alliedhpi.com. A copy may also be obtained from the Corporate Secretary at Allied Healthcare Products, Inc., 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Ethics Hotline
The Company encourages employees to report possible ethical issues. The Company maintains an ethics hotline that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive reports of ethical concerns or incidents, including, without limitation, concerns about accounting, internal controls or auditing matters. The ethics hotline number can be found on the Company's intranet. All such calls are received independently and are referred to the chairman of the audit committee for investigation and disposition where warranted. The Company prohibits retaliatory action against any employee for raising legitimate concerns or questions regarding ethical matters, or for reporting suspected violations of the Company's Code of Ethics and Conduct Guidelines. 
Householding Of Proxy Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g. brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. 
Under these rules, this year, brokers and other intermediaries may deliver a single proxy statement and annual report to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. The Company will deliver promptly upon written or oral requests a separate copy of the annual report or proxy statement to a security holder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. If, at any time, a stockholder no longer wishes to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, the affected stockholder may contact Stockholder Relations at 1720 Sublette Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63110. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should also contact the Chief Financial Officer as indicated in the preceding sentence. 
Other Matters
The Board of Directors of the Company is not aware of any other matters to come before the meeting. If any other matters should come before the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy intend to vote the proxy according to their best judgment. 
You are urged to complete, sign, date and return your proxy to make certain your shares of Common Stock will be voted at the 2018 Annual Meeting. For your convenience in returning the proxy, an addressed envelope is enclosed, requiring no additional postage if mailed in the United States.
