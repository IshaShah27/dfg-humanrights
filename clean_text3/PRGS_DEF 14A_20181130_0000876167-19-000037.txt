To Our Stockholders:
On behalf of the Board of Directors and management, we want to thank you for your continued support of Progress. In fiscal year 2018, we made solid progress towards achieving our key strategic and operational objectives while maintaining our ongoing commitment to strong corporate governance.
Strategy 
In fiscal 2018, we continued to execute on the strategic plan we implemented in 2017.  A key element of this strategy centers on providing the platform and tools enterprises need to build "cognitive applications," which we believe are the future of application development. Our budget and operating plan for 2018, as for 2017, reflected our focus on managing our business as efficiently as possible. Our 2018 financial results and the ongoing strength of our overall business enabled us to return meaningful amounts of capital to our stockholders in fiscal 2018 in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
Board Composition and Refreshment
After adding four new Board members in the past two years, this year's nominees all currently serve on the Progress Board. Each are accomplished business leaders with extensive experience in key strategic and operational roles for public and private companies. Our Board's qualifications and experience are a strength as Progress continues on its current strategy. We believe our current Board composition strikes an appropriate balance between directors with deep historical knowledge of the Company and those with a fresh viewpoint.
Executive Compensation
Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee emphasized alignment with our long-term business goals in designing our executive compensation programs for 2018.  Our executive compensation programs for 2018 reflected management's continued commitment to the strategic plan we implemented in 2017.
Thank you for your continued support for our vision for the future. We appreciate the opportunity to represent your interests as stockholders.
Your Board of Directors

Our Strategic Plan is Delivering Results…and Enhancing Stockholder Value
In fiscal 2018, we remained solidly on course with the execution of our strategic plan. Our budget and operating plan for 2018, as for 2017, reflected our continued expectations with respect to our core products and our focus on managing our business as efficiently as possible. We also made key investments in furtherance of our "Cognitive Applications" product strategy while maintaining our 35% operating margin commitment. 
Highlights of our recent operational and financial results include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reduction in annual expenses by almost $40 million over the past two years; 
• 400 bps operating margin expansion in fiscal 2018; 
• Key product releases in our core product lines, including OpenEdge, Sitefinity and Kendo UI;  
• 90%+ renewal rates in fiscal 2018 for OpenEdge, our flagship product;

• Nearly $150 million of capital returned to stockholders in fiscal 2018, including more than $25 million in dividends.

Executive Compensation Philosophy
The Compensation Committee's philosophy is to tie executive pay to performance to incent the achievement of outstanding returns to our stockholders and to drive the creation of sustainable long-term stockholder value.  Consistent with its pay-for-performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee, in designing our executive compensation programs for 2018, emphasized alignment with our long-term business goals.

4. To transact any other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement of that meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    Who can attend the meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: All stockholders as of the close of business on March 20, 2019, the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. If you plan to attend the meeting, please note that you will need to bring your proxy card or voting instruction card and valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the meeting and all mobile phones must be silenced during the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Please also note that if you hold your shares through a broker or other nominee, you will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date.
Q:    Who is entitled to vote at the meeting?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2019, the record date for the meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to participate in the Annual Meeting. If you were a stockholder of record on that date, you will be entitled to vote all shares that you held on that date at  
[END TABLE]
-2-
the meeting, or any postponements or adjournments of the meeting. There were 44,493,152 shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date.
Q:    What are the voting rights of the holders of our common stock?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Each share of our common stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and holding shares     as a beneficial owner? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by us. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us by completing, signing, dating and returning a proxy card, or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Many of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of your shares. We have sent these proxy materials to your broker or bank. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a proxy from your broker, bank or nominee. Your broker, bank or nominee will provide a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee regarding how to vote your shares.
Q:    What is a quorum?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: A quorum is the minimum number of our shares of common stock that must be represented at a duly called meeting in person or by proxy to legally conduct business at the meeting. For the Annual Meeting, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least 22,246,577 shares, which is a simple majority of the 44,493,152 shares outstanding as of the record date, will be considered a quorum allowing votes to be taken and counted for the matters before the stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
-3-
If you are a stockholder of record, you must deliver your vote by internet, phone or mail or attend the Annual Meeting in person and vote to be counted in the determination of a quorum.
Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be counted as present or represented at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker or other nominee who holds shares for a beneficial owner withholds its vote on a proposal with respect to which it does not have discretionary voting power or instructions from the beneficial owner.
Q:    What is the difference between a routine matter and a non-routine matter?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Brokers cannot vote on their customers' behalf on "non-routine" proposals such as Proposal One, the election of directors and Proposal Two, the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (say-on-pay vote). Because brokers require their customers' direction to vote on such non-routine matters, it is critical that stockholders provide their brokers with voting instructions. Proposal Three, the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, will be a "routine" matter for which your broker does not need your voting instruction to vote your shares. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    How do I vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you are a stockholder of record, you have the option of submitting your proxy card by internet, phone or mail or attending the meeting and delivering the proxy card. The designated proxy will vote per your instructions. You may also attend the meeting and personally vote by ballot. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, to vote at the meeting, you will need to obtain a signed proxy from the broker or nominee that holds your shares. If you have the broker's proxy, you may vote by ballot or you may complete and deliver another proxy card in person at the meeting.
When you vote, you are giving your "proxy" to the individuals we have designated to vote your shares at the meeting as you direct. If you do not make specific choices, they will vote your shares to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• elect the eight individuals nominated by our Board of Directors; 
• approve the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (say-on-pay vote); and 
• approve the ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
If any matter not listed in the Notice of Meeting is properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment. As of the date of this proxy statement, we 
-4-
knew of no matters that needed to be acted on at the meeting other than as discussed in this proxy statement.
Q:    How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
A:    The Board recommends that you vote your shares as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR Proposal One — elect the eight nominees to the Board of Directors. 
• FOR Proposal Two — approve the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (say-on-pay vote). 
• FOR Proposal Three— approve the ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    Can I change or revoke my vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You may revoke your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised by filing with our Secretary a written notice of revocation or by signing and duly delivering a proxy bearing a later date. At the meeting, you may revoke or change your vote by submitting a proxy to the inspector of elections or voting by ballot. Your attendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke your vote. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    How many votes are required to elect directors (Proposal One)?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The nominees who receive the most votes (also known as a "plurality" of the votes cast) will be elected. You may vote either FOR the nominee or WITHHOLD your vote from the nominee. Votes that are withheld will not be included in the vote tally for the election of the directors. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name for the election of the director. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. These broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. 
[END TABLE]
In an uncontested election, if a nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election, that nominee will submit his or her offer of resignation for consideration by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with our majority voting policy discussed in more detail on page 13 of this proxy statement.
-5-
Q:    How many votes are required to adopt the other proposals (Proposals Two and Three)?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The other proposals will be approved if these proposals receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote on these proposals. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" each of Proposals Two and Three. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on Proposal Two. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Those broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of the vote with respect to this Proposal. 
[END TABLE]
Brokerage firms do have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on Proposal Three (Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm). If a broker does not exercise this authority, such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. We are not required to obtain the approval of our stockholders to appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, if our stockholders do not ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending November 30, 2019, the Audit Committee of our Board will consider the results of this vote when selecting auditors in the future.
Q:    Who will pay for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: We will pay the cost of preparing, mailing and soliciting proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this proxy statement and any additional information furnished to stockholders.  We may reimburse banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians for their out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation materials to beneficial owners.  
[END TABLE]
Q:    What is "householding" of proxy materials?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In some cases, stockholders holding their shares in a brokerage or bank account who share the same surname and address and have not given contrary instructions received only one copy of the proxy materials. This practice is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save printing and postage costs. If you would like to have a separate copy of our Annual Report and/or proxy statement mailed to you or to receive separate copies of future mailings, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by mail at Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717 or by phone at (866) 540-7095. Such additional copies will be delivered promptly upon receipt of such request. 
[END TABLE]
-6-

[BEGIN TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Practices 
[END TABLE]
Our Board is Independent
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 7 of 8 nominees are independent – If the director nominees are elected at the Annual Meeting, the Board will continue to be composed of one employee director (Mr. Gupta, our CEO) and seven non-employee directors (Messrs. Egan, Dacier, Gawlick, Kane and Krall and Mses. King and Tucci). 
• Regular executive sessions of independent directors – Our independent directors meet in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer at every regularly scheduled Board meeting to discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. 
• Committees are independent – Each of the Board's committees are strictly comprised of independent directors. 
• Independent compensation consultant – The compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee is independent of the Company and management. 
[END TABLE]
We Have Strong Board Refreshment
We believe it is important to maintain a mix of longer-tenured, experienced directors, who can help to preserve continuity and institutional knowledge, and new directors, who can provide fresh perspectives. In furtherance of this objective, the Board elected Messrs. Dacier and Gawlick in June 2017 and Mses. King and Tucci in February 2018.  While we do not impose director tenure limits, our Corporate Governance Guidelines do impose a mandatory retirement age of eighty-five. We believe our current Board composition strikes an appropriate balance between directors with deep historical knowledge of the Company and those with a fresh viewpoint.
We Have an Independent Chairman of the Board
We currently have an independent Chairman of the Board (Mr. Egan). We believe the current Board leadership structure serves us and our stockholders well by having a strong independent Chairman of the Board to provide independent leadership of the Board and because it allows our CEO to focus primarily on the Company's business strategy, operations and corporate vision. This leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on Board independence, provides effective independent oversight of management. Board 
-9-
members have complete access to and are encouraged to utilize members of our senior management regularly, and they have the authority to retain independent advisors as they deem necessary. The Board believes this leadership structure affords our company an effective combination of internal and external experience, continuity and independence.
Key responsibilities of the independent Chairman of the Board include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
o calling meetings of the Board and independent directors; 
o setting the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the CEO and our Secretary; 
o chairing executive sessions of the independent directors; 
o leading the full Board in the annual CEO performance evaluation; 
o engaging with stockholders; 
o acting as an advisor to Mr. Gupta on strategic aspects of the CEO role with regular consultations on major developments and decisions likely to interest the Board; and o performing other duties specified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines or assigned by the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not require the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, as our Board believes that it is important that the Board retain flexibility to determine whether these roles should be separate or combined based upon the Board's assessment of the Company's needs and Progress's leadership at a given point in time. We believe that an effective board leadership structure is highly dependent on the experience, skills and personal interaction between those in leadership roles.  In prior years, we have had, alternately, an independent Chairman of the Board and a non-independent Chairman of the Board with a Lead Independent Director.  Our policy is to have a Lead Independent Director if the Chairman of the Board is not independent.
We Value Diversity
The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee value diversity of backgrounds, experience, perspectives and leadership in different fields when identifying nominees.  We believe that we have assembled a diverse set of directors with the varied backgrounds, experiences and perspectives critical to our long-term success.  Presently, 50% of our Board members are diverse in gender, ethnicity or nationality. To help us maintain broad diversity and to continually assess the effectiveness of this diversity policy, our Board of Directors conducts regular self-evaluations.  The survey questions include an assessment of whether the composition of the Board is appropriately diverse and possesses the skills and experience consistent with achieving our short and long-term corporate goals.
-10-
We are Committed to Corporate Responsibility
We work to conduct our business in ways that will have a positive impact on our stakeholders, our company and our society. As an organization, we believe it is incumbent upon us to consider the social and environmental impact of our business activities and create social and corporate value to the communities we serve.  Our customers, partners, stockholders, employees and the environment depend on this, and it is woven into the fabric of who we are. Important areas of focus for us are issues related to community engagement, diversity and inclusion, human capital development and environmental sustainability.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Community Engagement – We engage in the global community and support our employees that do so as well. Our community engagement endeavors have historically been driven by the passions of our employees, who have dedicated their time and fundraising efforts towards causes as diverse as our global employee population, with meaningful support from the Company.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we undertook efforts to further formalize and focus our charitable giving program, which we view as a critical part of an effective and strategic corporate social responsibility program. Philanthropy and lending a helping hand are values we share across the Company and something we, as an organization, wish to harness in order to create an even greater impact in our communities. In 2018 and early 2019, we worked to identify areas of philanthropic focus that align closely with who we are and what we do, such as support of education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), in order to maximize the impact of our charitable giving.
Additionally, we have a program to match our employees' charitable donations, including supporting communities impacted by disasters through corporate donations to relief organizations. We also provide our employees with paid time off to volunteer with community organizations and encourage our employees to lead philanthropic initiatives that matter to them. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Inclusion and Diversity – Progress is an inclusive workplace where opportunities to succeed are available to everyone. As a multicultural company serving a global community, we encourage a wide range of views and celebrate our diverse backgrounds. Our unique combination of perspectives inspires innovation, connects us to our customers and positively affects our communities. We seek employees with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints and are committed to creating a culture of innovation and inspiration where employees feel a strong sense of community and collective pride in our success.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we launched an inclusion and diversity initiative focused on fostering a more inclusive environment and diverse workforce by strengthening five key organizational areas: culture and belonging, talent acquisition, leveraging talent, management and leadership and career development. Additionally, in early 2019, we formed an I&D Advisory Committee made up of a diverse group of Progress employees from across the globe tasked with helping us to support the formation and implementation of I&D initiatives.
-11-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Human Capital Development – Another way we advance our commitment to Corporate Responsibility is in our commitment to our employees, who are key to our success.  As noted above, we are investing in programs to ensure that we maintain a diverse and inclusive environment.  Furthermore, we invest significant resources to developing the talent we need to strengthen our company while at the same time deepening our employees' skill sets and furthering their careers with us.  Through our communication and engagement efforts, our employees better understand how their work contributes to the overall strategy of the company.  We also gain valuable feedback on those programs designed to enhance their employee experience.  We also focus our human capital management efforts on rewarding performance that balances risk and reward, empowering professional growth and development, and investing in health, emotional and financial wellness.  We provide compensation, benefits, and resources to employees that reflect our commitment to being a great place to work. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, our Human Capital Department launched an extensive management training and development program focused on deepening our employees' skill sets.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Environmental Sustainability – Progress's products help companies run more efficiently.  Each of our solutions is created with these principles of action in mind: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
o Responsible citizenship o Protection of the earth o Sustainable use of natural resources o Reduction of waste o Energy conservation o Safe and healthy work environment 
[END TABLE]
Our sustainability initiatives include recycling programs and energy and resource conservation programs. Our corporate headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts has received LEED Gold certification. In 2018, we installed electric vehicle charging stations at our headquarters. 
Stockholder Rights
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of our directors stands for election every year.  We do not have a classified or staggered board.   
• We have adopted a majority voting policy for directors, as described below under "Our Majority Voting Policy." 
• Holders of 40% of outstanding shares can call a special meeting (lowered from 80% in March 2019). 
• We have no stockholders rights plan ("poison pill") in place. 
[END TABLE]
-12-
Strong Stockholder Support on Say-On-Pay
99% say-on-pay support at our 2018 Annual Meeting. We believe the vote indicates strong support for our executive compensation program, including enhancements made in recent years.
We Proactively Engage with our Stockholders
We actively seek to engage with our stockholders as part of our corporate governance cycle.  During the past two years, independent members of our Board and members of senior management spoke to a large cross-section of our stockholders.
Our Majority Voting Policy
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our majority voting policy for directors, which provides that any nominee for election to the Board in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election is to submit his or her offer of resignation for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to consider all relevant facts and circumstances and recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to that offer of resignation. The Board will then act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation. Promptly following the Board's decision, the Company will disclose that decision and an explanation of such decision in a filing with the SEC or a press release.
If the Board accepts a director's resignation, then the Board may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board, in each case pursuant to our Bylaws. If a director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, such director will continue to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or special meeting in lieu of such Annual Meeting or until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.
Through this policy, the Board seeks to be accountable to all stockholders and respects the rights of stockholders to express their views through their votes for directors. At the same time, the policy allows the Board sufficient flexibility to make sound evaluations based on the relevant circumstances and to act in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders in the event of a greater than or equal to 50% "withhold" vote against a specific director.
Our Board Evaluates Its Effectiveness
The Board conducts self-evaluations on a regular basis to determine whether it is functioning effectively and whether any changes are necessary to improve its performance.  This process is developed and overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and conducted with the help of our external counsel. Among other things, members assess (via discussions with the Chairman of the Board and/
-13-
or the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, written questionnaires, or a combination of the two methods) the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, director performance and Board dynamics. The results of these self-evaluations, and action items, if any, are reported to and discussed by the Board.
Our Board of Directors Has a Significant Role in Risk Oversight
Our Board of Directors believes that its oversight responsibility with respect to the various risks confronting our company is one of its most important areas of responsibility and provides further checks and balances on our leadership structure. Our Board of Directors views its oversight of risk as an ongoing process that occurs throughout the year while evaluating the strategic direction and actions of our company. A fundamental aspect of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also determining what level of risk is appropriate for the company. We believe that having an independent Chairman of the Board enhances our Board's ability to oversee our risks.
In carrying out this critical function, our Board is involved in risk oversight through direct decision-making authority with respect to significant matters and the oversight of management directly by our Board and through its committees. Each committee's specific area of responsibility is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Audit Committee   Compensation Committee   Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee   Mergers and Acquisitions Committee 
Primarily responsible for overseeing risk management as it relates to our financial condition, financial statements, financial reporting process, internal controls and accounting matters, as well as  cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee also assists our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to conflict of interest issues that may arise.   Responsible for overseeing our overall compensation practices, policies and programs and assessing the risks arising from those policies and programs.   Considers risks related to our corporate governance practices and leadership structure of the Board, including evaluating and considering evolving corporate governance best practices and director and management succession planning.   Considers risks related to our consideration of acquisitions and other strategic transactions. 
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors receives reports from members of senior management on the functional areas for which they are responsible. These reports may include operational, financial, sales, competitive, legal and 
-14-
regulatory, strategic and other risks, as well as any related management and mitigation.  In addition, the Board plays an active oversight and risk mitigation role through its regular review of the Company's strategic direction. 
In 2018, an increased area of focus for us was enhancing our risk mitigation practices around cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity protection is vital to our organization and our stakeholders, and we are committed to ensuring that our products, data and systems are secure from potential breach. In 2018, we formed a cybersecurity governance team composed of key members of management and IT, data and product security personnel. Management provides updates to the Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters, including information about cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal cybersecurity and security features of the products and services we provide our customers.
Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics that applies to all officers, directors and employees. Copies of the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics can be found on our website at www.progress.com under the heading "Corporate Governance" located on the "Investor Relations" page.
How to Communicate with Our Board
Our Board of Directors welcomes communications from stockholders. Any stockholder may communicate either with our Board of Directors as a whole, or with any individual director, by sending a written communication addressed to the Board of Directors or to such director at our offices located at 14 Oak Park Drive, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, or by submitting an email communication to BOD@progress.com. All communications sent to our Board of Directors will be forwarded to the Board of Directors or to the individual director to whom such communication was addressed.

Director Nomination Process
Board Membership Criteria
Our Board of Directors has delegated the search for, and recommendation of, director nominees to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. When considering a potential candidate for membership on our Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any criteria it deems appropriate, including, among other things, the background, experience and qualifications of any candidate as well as such candidate's past or anticipated contributions to our Board of Directors and its Committees. At a minimum, each nominee is expected to have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Highest personal and professional integrity   Demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment   Effectiveness, with the other directors, in collectively serving the long-term interests of our stockholders 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has established the following minimum requirements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at least five years of business experience; 
• no identified conflicts of interest as a prospective director of our company; 
• no convictions in a criminal proceeding (aside from traffic violations) during the five years prior to the date of selection; and 
• willingness to comply with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors retains the right to modify these minimum qualifications from time to time, and exceptional candidates who do not meet these criteria may still be considered.
-17-
In addition to any other standards the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may deem appropriate from time to time for the overall structure and composition of our Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers numerous other qualities, skills and characteristics when evaluating director nominees such as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• direct experience in the software industry or in the markets in which we operate; 
• an understanding of, and experience in, accounting, legal, finance, product, sales and/or marketing matters; 
• experience on other public or private company boards; 
• leadership experience with public companies or other major organizations; and 
• diversity of the Board, considering the business and professional experience, educational background, reputation, and industry expertise across various market segments and technologies relevant to our business, as well as other relevant attributes of the candidates. 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to criteria and no criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees.
In February 2018, we added two new directors to our Board: Samskriti Y. King and Angela T. Tucci. The Board, through its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and with the assistance of an independent executive search firm, selected Ms. King and Ms. Tucci from a large pool of highly qualified individuals, including candidates suggested by our stockholders. The search process, which was initiated and publicly announced in October 2017, emphasized diverse individuals with experience as senior executives in the enterprise infrastructure software industry. Among the many factors considered by the Board when assessing Ms. King's and Ms. Tucci's respective experience, qualification, attributes and skills were the unique and diverse perspectives that, as female directors, they could each bring to the Board.
Director Nomination Process
Generally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies candidates for director nominees in consultation with the other directors and management, using search firms or other advisors, through recommendations submitted by stockholders or through other methods that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems to be helpful to identify candidates. In the case of incumbent directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews each incumbent director's overall past service to us, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance, and whether the director continues to meet applicable independence standards.
In the case of a new director candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee confirms that the candidate meets the minimum qualifications for a director nominee established by the 
-18-
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The candidate will also be interviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and other Board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then meets to discuss and evaluate the qualities and skills of each candidate, both on an individual basis and considering the overall composition and needs of our Board of Directors. The same procedures apply to all candidates for director nomination, including candidates submitted by stockholders.
Based on the results of the evaluation process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends candidates for our Board of Directors' approval as director nominees for election to our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also recommends candidates to our Board of Directors for appointment to its Committees.
Stockholder Recommendations
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominee candidates who are recommended by stockholders of our company. Recommendations sent by stockholders must provide the following information:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name and address of record of the stockholder; 
• a representation that the stockholder is a record holder of our common stock, or if the stockholder is not a record holder, evidence of ownership in accordance with Rule 14a-8(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); 
• the name, age, business and residential address, educational background, current principal occupation or employment, and principal occupation or employment for the preceding five full fiscal years of the proposed director candidate; 
• a description of the qualifications and background of the proposed director candidate which addresses the minimum qualifications described above; 
• a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and the proposed director candidate; and 
• any other information regarding the proposed director candidate that is required to be included in a proxy statement filed under SEC rules. 
[END TABLE]
The submission must be accompanied by a written consent of the individual to be named in our proxy statement as standing for election if nominated by our Board of Directors and to serve if elected by the stockholders. Stockholder recommendations of candidates for election as directors at an Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be given at least 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of our proxy statement for the previous year's Annual Meeting.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
Board of Directors
Director Independence
Having an independent Board is a core component of our governance philosophy. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, as a matter of policy and consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations, a majority of the Board should be independent.
Based on the review and recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board has determined that all current directors except Yogesh Gupta (our current President and Chief Executive Officer) are independent within the meaning of the director independence standards of NASDAQ and the applicable rules of the SEC. In making this determination, we solicited information from each of the directors regarding whether that director, or any member of his immediate family, had a direct or indirect material interest in any transactions involving our company, was involved in a debt relationship with our company or received personal benefits outside the scope of the director's normal compensation. We considered the responses of the directors, and independently considered the commercial agreements, acquisitions and other material transactions entered by us during 2018, and determined that none of our non-employee directors had a material interest in those transactions. Our Board similarly determined that former director Michael Mark, who did not stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting, was independent within the meaning of the director independence standards of NASDAQ and the applicable rules of the SEC.
There are no family relationships between any director, executive officer or director nominee.
Director Attendance
Our Board of Directors met nine times during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. During 2018, each director nominee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of our Board of Directors and the total number of meetings of all committees of our Board of Directors on which he or she served from and after his or her election to the Board.  Mses. King and Tucci were appointed to the Board in February 2018.
In January 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a policy requiring members of our Board of Directors to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All but one of the members of our Board of Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Director Compensation Plan—Fiscal 2018
We pay our directors a mix of cash and equity compensation. Employee directors receive no compensation for their service as directors.
In accordance with the 2018 Director Compensation Plan adopted by the Board, for 2018, our non-employee directors were paid an annual retainer of $250,000. This annual retainer was paid $50,000 in cash and $200,000 in equity, in the form of deferred stock units ("DSUs"). The independent Chairman of the Board was paid an additional cash retainer of $50,000. The annual retainers were paid in cash in June 2018.
Prior to adopting the 2018 Director Compensation Plan, the Compensation Committee received market data from its independent compensation consultant and considered whether any changes in director compensation were required. Based on the market data, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board no changes to director compensation.
The number of DSUs was determined by dividing the equity retainer by the grant date closing price of our common stock as reported by NASDAQ. Upon issuance, the DSUs vest in a single installment on the date of the Annual Meeting, subject to continued service on our Board of Directors. DSUs do not convert to shares of common stock until a director terminates service on the Board of Directors or upon a change in control, whichever occurs first.
With respect to service on the committees of our Board of Directors, the following fees were paid:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee - $25,000 for the Chair and $20,000 for the other members;

[END TABLE]
The fees paid for service on the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees were paid in cash in June 2018.
In March 2017, our Board of Directors adopted revised stock retention guidelines for non-employee directors. These guidelines provide for all non-employee directors to hold an amount of our common stock, 
-35-
restricted shares, stock options and/or deferred stock units having a value equal to at least five times the annual cash retainer. Directors have five years to attain this ownership threshold.
Each newly elected director receives an initial director appointment grant of $300,000 of deferred stock units at the first April or October grant date following his or her election to our Board of Directors. These deferred stock units vest over a 60-month period, beginning on the first day of the month following the month the director joins our Board of Directors, with full acceleration of vesting upon a change of control. In March 2019, the Board of Directors eliminated the initial director appointment grant for future appointees to the Board.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
Pursuant to the Audit Committee's Charter, which can be found at www.progress.com under the Corporate Governance page located on the "Investor Relations" page, the Audit Committee is responsible for the review and approval of related person transactions. A related person is a director, executive officer, nominee for director or certain stockholders of our company since the beginning of the last fiscal year and their respective immediate family members. A related person transaction is a transaction involving: (1) our company and any related person when the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and (2) the related person has a material direct or indirect interest.
We identify transactions for review and approval through our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics which can be found at www.progress.com under the Corporate Governance page located on the "Investor Relations" page. The Code of Conduct and Business Ethics requires our employees to disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest to his or her manager, our human capital department or our Chief Compliance Officer. This disclosure also applies to potential conflicts involving immediate family members of employees. We require our directors to complete a questionnaire intended to identify any transactions or potential transactions that must be reported per SEC rules and regulations. This questionnaire also requires our directors to promptly notify us of any changes during the year.
Transactions with Related Persons
During fiscal 2018, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries engaged in any transactions or series of similar transactions in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any of our directors or executive officers, any holder of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had a direct or indirect material interest, nor are any such transactions currently proposed.

PROPOSAL TWO: ADVISORY VOTE ON 
COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
We are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. We urge you to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation" sections of this proxy statement which describe in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the related compensation tables and narrative, which provide detailed information on the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers. We believe our executive compensation programs demonstrate our pay for performance philosophy, which creates alignment with our stockholders and drives the creation of sustainable long-term stockholder value.
Required Vote and Board Recommendation
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at our Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the "Summary Compensation Table" and the other related tables and narrative disclosure."
This say-on-pay vote is advisory only and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. Although the vote is advisory, our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and expect to take the outcome of this vote into account when considering future compensation arrangements for our executive officers.
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.

PROPOSAL THREE: RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Proposal Three is to ratify the selection by the Audit Committee of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. Deloitte & Touche LLP was the independent registered public accounting firm for our company for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. Based on the Audit Committee's assessment of Deloitte & Touche's qualifications and performance, our Board believes Deloitte & Touche's retention for fiscal year 2019 is in the best interests of the Company.
Although ratification by stockholders is not required by law or by our bylaws, the Audit Committee believes that submission of its selection to stockholders is a matter of good corporate governance. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and its stockholders. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Audit Committee will take that fact into consideration, together with such other factors it deems relevant, in determining its next selection of an independent registered public accounting firm.
We have been advised that a representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting. This representative will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions presented at the meeting.

Executive Summary 
[END TABLE]
Business Overview
We offer the leading platform for developing and deploying strategic business applications, enabling customers and partners to deliver modern, high-impact digital experiences with a fraction of the effort, time and cost of other solutions. We provide powerful tools for easily building adaptive user experiences across any type of device or touchpoint, award-winning machine learning that enables cognitive capabilities to be a part of any application, the flexibility of a serverless cloud to deploy modern apps, business rules, web content management and leading data connectivity technology. Over 1,700 independent software vendors, 100,000 enterprise customers, and 2 million developers rely on Progress to power their applications.
Our Strategy
Our fiscal 2018 was the second year in the transformation we began shortly after Mr. Gupta became our Chief Executive Officer in October 2016.  In early fiscal 2017, we announced a new strategy that would leverage our application development platform capabilities and enable our customers and partners to build next generation applications (which we refer to as, "Cognitive Applications") that drive their businesses. This new strategy builds on our inherent DNA and vast experience in application development established over 35 years.  In addition to utilizing our existing solutions and capabilities for this strategy, in fiscal 2017, we acquired Kinvey, Inc. and DataRPM, each bringing critical solutions to our application development platform.  This product strategy provides a future technology path for existing customers as well as enables us to win new customers, which will enhance our prospects for future revenue growth.
At the same time, we also announced a major restructuring of our operations.  We concluded that because our existing core products competed in mature market segments with limited growth opportunities, we needed to moderate our view of their growth prospects. In response, we shifted our organization and operating principles for these product lines, with the goal of serving our core customer base more profitably and with a focus on retention rather than the pursuit of new customers.  We committed to maintaining 35% operating income margins as part of this operating strategy.   
We also adopted a new capital allocation strategy, in which we target to return approximately 75-80% of our annual cash flows from operations to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and through dividends. We have also adopted a disciplined approach with strict financial criteria to future acquisitions.  By adopting strict financial criteria for future acquisitions, these acquisitions will enable us to drive significant stockholder returns by providing scale and increased cash flows.

Our Strategic Plan is Delivering Results…and Enhancing Stockholder Value
In fiscal 2018, we remained solidly on course with the execution of our strategic plan. Our budget and operating plan for 2018, as for 2017, reflected our continued expectations with respect to our core products and our focus on managing our business as efficiently as possible.  We also made key investments in furtherance of our Cognitive Applications product strategy while maintaining our 35% operating margin commitment.
Highlights of our recent operational and financial results include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reduction in annual expenses by almost $40 million over the past two years; 
• 400 bps operating margin expansion in fiscal 2018; 
• Key product releases in our core product lines, including OpenEdge, Sitefinity and Kendo UI; 
• 90%+ renewal rates in fiscal 2018 for OpenEdge, our flagship product; 
• Over $120 million in cash from operations generated in fiscal 2018; and 
• Nearly $150 million of capital returned to stockholders in fiscal 2018, including more than $25 million in dividends. 
[END TABLE]
The table below summarizes our 2018 financial results as compared to fiscal 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) Fiscal 2018 Actual Fiscal 2017 Actual 
GAAP       
  Revenue $397.2 $397.6

A reconciliation between the GAAP results and non-GAAP measures is located in Appendix A at the end of this proxy statement.
GAAP Results vs. Non-GAAP Measures
As disclosed in our press releases regarding annual and quarterly earnings and other communications, we provide financial information using methods in addition to those prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), such as non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP 
-49-
operating income, non-GAAP earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the reader's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future by providing more transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure our business. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies and enables investors to consider our operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during and following the integration period of our acquisitions. Presenting the GAAP measures on their own may not be indicative of our core operating results. Furthermore, management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
Non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP costs of sales and operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of purchase accounting on the fair value of acquired deferred revenue, amortization of acquired intangible assets, impairment of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses, certain identified non-operating gains and losses, and the related tax effects of the preceding items. Adjusted free cash flow is equal to cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, plus restructuring payments.
This non-GAAP information is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP information and should be considered in conjunction with our GAAP results as the items excluded from the non-GAAP information often have a material impact on our financial results. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to our GAAP financial results in our earnings releases and we make this information available on our website at www.progress.com within the "Investor Relations" section.
2018 Executive Compensation Program Design
The Compensation Committee's philosophy is to tie executive pay to company performance, thereby creating alignment with our stockholders and driving the creation of sustainable long-term stockholder value. Our executive compensation programs for 2018 reflected our commitment to the multi-pronged strategy we launched in 2017. As noted above, this strategy consists of three primary objectives: aligning our resources to drive profitability, protecting and strengthening our core business and executing on our holistic capital allocation approach.  Our fiscal 2018 budget and operating plan reflected our expectations for limited growth for our core products and prioritized enhancing customer retention.  At the same time, our operating plan also provided for us to make the investments necessary in furtherance of our Cognitive Applications product strategy, which will provide a technology path to our existing customers and partners and enable us to win new customers. The overarching priority of our fiscal 2018 plan was that we operate our business as efficiently as possible in order to strengthen Progress for the benefit of our stockholders.  
-50-
As was the case in fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee utilized a combination of short and long-term compensation programs to advance our strategy.  
FISCAL 2018 COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
Our executives' target compensation for fiscal 2018 consisted of the components described below:
*Reflects average
Alignment of CEO Realizable Pay Value and Performance 
The Compensation Committee reviews realizable pay value analyses for the executive officers to inform design and award levels for long-term incentive ("LTI") awards. We believe our executive compensation program has been effective at driving the achievement of our target financial and strategic results, 
-51-
appropriately aligning executive pay and corporate performance and enabling us to attract and retain top executives within our industry.  When results do not meet our expectations, our named executive officers receive compensation that is below our target levels and may be below market in comparison to our peer group. The table below shows the target and realizable pay for our CEO, Mr. Gupta for fiscal years 2016 through 2018.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Total Target Compensation ($)(1)Total Realizable Compensation ($)(2)Realizable Pay as a Percentage of Target Pay 
  Total Target Compensation ($)(1)Total Realizable Compensation ($)(2)Realizable Pay as a Percentage of Target Pay 
    2016 (3) 1,673,039 561,066 34% 
2017 3,225,000 2,160,611 67% 
2018 4,800,000 2,323,977 48% 
Average 2016-2018 (3) 3,232,680 1,681,884 52% 
(1) Total Target Compensation is defined as the sum of (a) annual base salary, (b) target bonus, (c) the value of stock options awarded, equal to the number of options granted multiplied by the Black-Scholes value of our stock on the grant date (d) the value of restricted stock units awarded, equal to the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of our stock on the grant date and (e) the value of the PSUs awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan, equal to the number of PSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of our stock on the grant date. 
(2) Total Realizable Compensation is defined as the sum of (a) annual base salary, (b) actual corporate bonus plan award paid, (c) the "in-the-money" value of stock options, (d) the value of restricted stock units awarded, equal to the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of our stock on November 30, 2018, which was $35.16, and (e) the value of PSUs awarded, determined by measuring the performance thus far in the performance period and determining the resulting level of assumed payout as of the most recent fiscal year end.  We excluded the value of the PSUs awarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 because, as of the end of our fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, none of those PSUs would vest.  With respect to the 2018 LTIP PSUs, based on company performance thus far in the performance period, we have assumed achievement of that portion of the PSUs tied to cumulative operating income at target levels.  As a result of our financial performance in fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, Mr. Gupta earned 15%, 115% and 62% of his annual bonus, respectively. 
[END TABLE]
(3)  Amounts shown for 2016 do not include the $2,500,000 one-time special new hire RSU award granted to Mr. Gupta in October 2016.
-52-
Following fiscal 2016, the amount and mix of Mr. Gupta's compensation has largely remained unchanged, including his base salary and annual target bonus. In 2018, we evaluated Mr. Gupta's 2017 fiscal target annual equity compensation against our compensation peer group and determined that, based on market data, Mr. Gupta's target annual equity compensation was in the 25th percentile of market data. Accordingly, for fiscal 2018, Mr. Gupta's annual equity award was increased to a value of $3,650,000 in order to bring his target equity compensation in line with the 50th percentile of market data, with 50% of the award in the form of LTIP PSUs, 30% in the form of time-based RSUs and 20% in the form of stock options.
Response to 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote and the Evolution of our Executive Compensation Program
We value the input of our stockholders on our compensation programs. We hold an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis. We also regularly seek feedback from our stockholders to better understand their opinions on governance issues, including compensation. The Compensation Committee carefully considers stockholder feedback and the outcome of each vote when reviewing our executive compensation programs each year.
At our 2018 annual stockholders meeting, approximately 99% of the votes cast approved, on an advisory basis, our executive compensation for fiscal year 2017. As shown in the table below, for each of the past three years, we received at least 98% support with respect to the advisory vote on executive compensation.
Over the past several years we have made significant changes to our executives' compensation in response to prior say-on-pay votes and feedback from stockholders as shown in the table below. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes and our stockholder views when making future compensation decisions for our executives.

Executive Compensation Program 
[END TABLE]
Philosophy and Objectives
Our philosophy is to reward executive officers based upon corporate performance, as well as to provide long-term incentives for the achievement of financial and strategic goals. We use a combination of cash compensation, composed of base salary and an annual cash bonus program, long-term equity incentive compensation programs, and a broad-based benefits program to create a competitive compensation package for our executive management team. We tie the payment of cash and equity incentive compensation to executive officers exclusively to the achievement of financial objectives.
-55-
The Compensation Committee uses the following principles to guide its decisions regarding the compensation of our executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Pay for Performance: Total compensation should reflect a "pay for performance" philosophy in which more than 50% of each executive officer's compensation is tied to the achievement of company financial objectives. Cash compensation for our executive officers is weighted toward short-term incentive bonus awards tied to company financial objectives that are difficult to attain and require achievement closely linked to our annual operating plan and budget and publicly-announced expectations. 
Alignment with Stockholders' Interests: Total compensation levels should include performance-based equity awards to align executive officer and stockholder interests. 
Internal Parity: To the extent practicable, base salaries and short- and long-term incentive targets for similarly-situated executive officers should be comparable to avoid divisiveness and encourage teamwork, collaboration, and a cooperative working environment. 
External Competitiveness: Total compensation should be competitive with peer companies so that we can attract and retain high performing key executive talent. To achieve this goal within market ranges, our Compensation Committee annually reviews the compensation practices of other companies in our peer group, as discussed in the "Peer Group" section below. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Review Process
Role of Compensation Committee
Toward the end of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee begins the process of reviewing executive officer compensation for the next fiscal year. The Compensation Committee is provided with reports from its independent compensation consultant comparing our executive compensation and equity granting practices relative to the market and to our peer group. The Compensation Committee reviews recommendations from management on the current fiscal year annual and long-term incentive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee then reviews and approves any changes to executive officers' total target cash compensation, which includes base salary and target incentive compensation, and long-term equity incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews all recommendations considering our compensation philosophy and seeks input from its independent compensation consultant prior to making any final decisions.
-56-
Role of Chief Executive Officer
Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation for his direct reports (including our other named executive officers). In making these recommendations, the factors considered include market data, tenure, individual performance, responsibilities, and experience levels of the executives, as well as the compensation of the executives relative to one another.
These initial CEO recommendations are discussed with the Chairman of the Compensation Committee or presented at Compensation Committee meetings. The Total Rewards group within our Human Capital Department and individuals within our Finance and Legal Departments support the Compensation Committee in the performance of its responsibilities. During 2018, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Talent Officer regularly attended the Compensation Committee meetings to provide perspectives on the competitive landscape, the needs of the business, information about our financial performance and relevant legal and regulatory developments.
The Compensation Committee meets in executive session (without management) with its independent compensation consultant to deliberate on executive compensation matters. None of our executive officers participate in the Compensation Committee's deliberations or decisions regarding their own compensation.
Role of Compensation Consultant
Our Compensation Committee again retained Pay Governance to advise it on matters related to executive compensation for 2018.
Other than providing limited guidance regarding our broad-based equity plan design for all employees, Pay Governance did not provide any services for management in 2018. Pay Governance consulted with our management when requested by the Compensation Committee and only as necessary to obtain relevant compensation and performance data for the executives as well as essential business information so that it could effectively support the Compensation Committee with appropriate competitive market information and relevant analyses.
During 2018, Pay Governance provided a range of services to the Compensation Committee to support the Compensation Committee's agenda and obligations, including providing advice relating to the impact of regulatory updates, industry trends and peer group compensation data, so that the Compensation Committee could set compensation for executives and non-employee directors in accordance with our policies and the Compensation Committee's charter, advice on the structure and competitiveness of our compensation programs, and advice on the consistency of our programs with our executive compensation philosophy.
Representatives of Pay Governance attended Compensation Committee meetings and provided advice to the Compensation Committee upon its request. The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Pay Governance and determined that Pay Governance is independent of our company and has no relationships that could create a conflict of interest with us. As part of its assessment, the 
-57-
Compensation Committee considered the fact that Pay Governance did not provide any other services to us and consults with our management only as necessary to provide the services described above.
Peer Group 
To assist the Compensation Committee in making decisions on total compensation for executives and company-wide equity grants, the Compensation Committee utilizes peer and industry group data and analyses. Each year, as necessary, the Compensation Committee reviews with its independent compensation consultant the list of peer companies as points of comparison to ensure that comparisons are meaningful.
For 2018, Pay Governance provided recommendations on the composition of our peer group. Based on the facts described in the table below and management's input, for 2018, Pay Governance recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, the following peer group:

For 2018, the Compensation Committee replaced four peer companies utilized in 2017 with five new additions as shown in the table above. Three of the replaced companies (Epiq Systems, Inc., Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc. and Jive Software, Inc.) were recently acquired.  The Compensation Committee replaced Splunk, Inc. because its market cap had exceeded our criteria.
Pay Governance then prepared a compensation analysis based on survey data and data gathered from publicly available information for our peer group companies.
-58-
Survey Data
The executive compensation analysis prepared by Pay Governance also included data from Radford's 2017 Global Technology Survey for companies with revenues between $200 million and $500 million. The Compensation Committee used this data to compare the current compensation of our named executive officers to the peer group and to determine the relative market value for position, based on direct, quantitative comparisons of pay levels. The survey data was used when there was a lack of public peer data for an executive's position and to obtain a general market understanding of current compensation practices.
Competitive Positioning
The fiscal 2018 target total direct compensation for our named executive officers was set by the Compensation Committee based predominantly on competitive pay practices, as reflected in the peer group and survey data. The Compensation Committee reviews market data at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile and, for 2018, sought to target total direct compensation for the named executive officers as a group at the 50th percentile of our peer group in setting our executive compensation programs.  Additional adjustments were considered based on individual importance to our company, anticipated future contributions, internal pay equity, and historical pay levels, as well as the level of an executive officer's unvested equity awards and incentives.
In determining equity awards related to the recruitment or promotion of executive officers, the Compensation Committee seeks to align the interests of these executives with our stockholders and reviews and considers: market data, forfeited awards at prior employers, importance of role, candidate experience, transitional state of the Company and internal positioning.  New hire and promotional equity awards are generally one-time in nature and future awards to these executive officers are aligned with our annual equity award structure.
On occasion, the Compensation Committee makes additional grants of equity awards for the purpose of encouraging certain executives and other individuals to remain with our company. In situations where management determines that additional grants of equity awards are necessary or appropriate for our continued success, recommendations are made by the Chief Executive Officer to the Compensation Committee. Retention awards include vesting provisions that are designed to encourage recipients to maintain their employment with us and these provisions may differ from our standard vesting schedules. For example, in October 2018, the Compensation Committee granted special, one-time restricted stock unit awards to Messrs. Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett as part of a larger retention award to certain key employees.
Components of Executive Officer Compensation 
Compensation for our named executive officers currently consists of three primary components that are designed to reward performance in a simple and straightforward manner: base salaries, annual cash

2018 Executive Compensation Decisions 
[END TABLE]
2018 Program Design
Consistent with its pay-for-performance philosophy, the Compensation Committee emphasized alignment with our long-term business goals in designing our executive compensation programs for 2018.  Our executive compensation programs for 2018 were designed to reflect our continued commitment to the new strategic and operating plan we launched in 2017.  As noted above, our strategy consists of three primary objectives--aligning our resources to drive profitability, protecting and strengthening our core business and executing on our holistic capital allocation approach.  Our fiscal 2018 budget and operating plan reflected our expectations for limited growth for our core products and prioritized enhancing customer retention.  At the same time, our operating plan also provided for us to make the investments necessary in furtherance of our Cognitive Applications product strategy, which will provide a technology path to our existing customers and partners and enable us to win new customers.  The overarching priority of our fiscal 2018 plan was that we operate our business as efficiently as possible to strengthen Progress for the benefit of our stockholders.  
Unlike our fiscal 2017 compensation programs, which reflected that most of our executive management team, including our named executive officers, had either joined in, or assumed new roles during, fiscal 2017, the fiscal 2018 compensation programs did not include any signing bonuses or new hire awards for the executive management team.

Pay Mix
In setting the mix among the different elements of executive compensation, we do not target specific allocations, but generally weight target compensation more heavily toward performance-based compensation, both cash and equity. The percentage of performance-based compensation for our executive officers and other employees increases with job responsibility, reflecting our view of internal pay equity and the ability of a given employee to contribute to our results. We also generally align our compensation mix with the practices of our peer group when possible and to the extent consistent with our compensation strategy and business plan.
As shown in the tables below, the total direct compensation mix for Mr. Gupta and our other named executive officers in fiscal 2018 was consistent with our peer group.
-63-
* "Other NEOs" reflects average of NEO salaries, excluding CFO
These allocations reflect our belief that a significant portion of our named executive officers' compensation should be performance-based and therefore "at risk" based on company performance, as well as subject to service requirements. Since our cash incentive opportunities and equity incentive awards have both upside opportunities and downside risks and our actual performance can deviate from the target goals, the amount of compensation earned will differ from the target allocations.
In October 2018, upon the recommendation of Mr. Gupta, the Compensation Committee issued special one-time equity awards consisting of time-based restricted stock units with a value of $200,000 to each of Messrs. Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett.  These one-time awards, which are more fully described below, are not included in the Pay Mix discussion above.

Cash Incentive Compensation
Annual Cash Bonus 
It is our philosophy to base a significant portion of each executive officer's total compensation opportunity on performance incentives. Our annual bonus plan is intended to motivate eligible participants toward overall business results, to tie their goals and interests to those of the Company and its stockholders, and to enable the Company to attract and retain highly qualified executives. Our bonus plan is administered by our Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee set the target annual cash incentive opportunity for 2018 (expressed as a percentage of base salary earned during the year) for each named executive officer in January 2018. In setting the target levels, the Compensation Committee considered each named executive officer's 2018 target total cash opportunity against the peer group data provided by our independent compensation consultant, internal pay equity and the roles and responsibilities of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee set each named executive officer's cash bonus target at the same percentage as his or her respective target opportunity in 2017.  The Compensation Committee believes that the target annual cash 
-72-
bonus opportunity should make up a larger portion of an executive officer's total target cash compensation as the executive's level of responsibility increases.
2018 Plan Design
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the 2018 Corporate Bonus Plan. Our named executive officers participated in the Corporate Bonus Plan.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee adopted three plan metrics for the Corporate Bonus Plan, all of which would be utilized to determine funding and payout under the cash bonus plans. These three plan metrics were non-GAAP corporate revenue, non-GAAP operating income and adjusted free cash flow.  These three plan metrics were the same metrics utilized by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2017.  New to the plan design for 2018 was the requirement that, in order to fund the revenue metric should performance under such metric be achieved, we must also achieve 100% of the fiscal year 2018 total annual bookings target for our Cognitive Applications products, consisting primarily of Kinvey and DataRPM. 
As was the case in fiscal 2017, non-GAAP corporate revenue was weighted at 40%, non-GAAP operating income was weighted at 40%, and the adjusted free cash flow metric was weighted at 20%. Each metric was measured separately and was not impacted by performance with respect to the other metrics. The performance measures selected for our cash bonus plan were designed to support our goals of expanding our non-GAAP operating income, while at the same time preserving our strong cash flow, which would result in increased stockholder returns. Our revenue targets reflected our continued expectations of the growth prospects of our core products.  The inclusion of the requirement that we meet our fiscal 2018 total annual bookings target for our Cognitive Applications products in order to achieve the revenue metric reflected the importance of these products to our overall strategy.  For further detail about our use of non-GAAP measures, refer to the paragraph entitled, "GAAP Results vs. non-GAAP Measures" above.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee set the thresholds for purposes of earning any award under the Corporate Bonus Plan at 99% of the total revenue target, 94% of the operating income target and 96% of the adjusted free cash flow target under our fiscal 2018 annual budget. Although the Compensation Committee retained the funding percentage for threshold-level achievement at 25% for bonus plan participants below the senior executive level, for Mr. Gupta and the other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee adopted a funding percentage for threshold-level achievement at 50% with respect to the revenue and free cash flow metrics.  The rationale for this difference was that the Compensation Committee determined that no funding should occur with respect to a metric for which the performance was below our publicly-announced expectations for fiscal 2018 performance.
The targets established with respect to the total revenue goal, including the newly added revenue metric overlay related to the Cognitive Applications products bookings target, reflect the challenges we face in maintaining our core revenues while implementing our growth strategy. The targets established with respect to the non-GAAP operating income metric are consistent with our operational model for our core business. The 
-73-
targets established with respect to the adjusted free cash flow goal reflect the importance of maintaining a strong cash balance to enable us to execute a capital allocation strategy in the best interests of stockholders.
Corporate Bonus Plan Criteria and Achievement
The table below shows the funding percentages based on our performance under the three metrics.  For the named executive officers, none of the annual bonus under the Corporate Bonus Plan would be earned unless we achieved at least $401 million in total non-GAAP revenue, $149 million in total non-GAAP operating income or $117 million in adjusted free cash flow, in which case a portion of the bonus would be earned based on the level of achievement and weighting of the metrics.

Total 100%           62%

Amounts Earned under the 2018 Corporate Bonus Plan
As a result of our financial performance during fiscal 2018, we exceeded the target level of performance under our bonus plan with respect to both the non-GAAP operating income metric and the adjusted free cash flow metric, but failed to meet the threshold level of performance under the non-GAAP revenue metric, which resulted in an overall payout percentage of 62% with respect to the annual cash bonus.  For Mr. Gupta and the other executive officers, the actual bonuses earned were based 100% on the financial metrics described above and no portion of the annual bonuses were based on subjective measures. 
The following table shows the bonuses earned by our named executive officers under the Corporate Bonus Plan in 2018.

Equity Compensation 
We use equity compensation to attract, retain, motivate and reward our named executive officers. We issue annual and new hire equity awards based on guidelines for awards commensurate with position levels and that reflect grant practices within our peer group and the broader software industry generally. The Compensation Committee reviews the mix of equity awards to our named executive officers on an annual basis.
PSUs under our long-term equity incentive compensation plan ("LTIP") are subject to performance criteria aligned with our business plan and are earned only to the extent the performance criteria are achieved. LTIP PSUs are earned based on performance over a three-year measurement period.
RSUs typically vest in six equal installments over three years beginning six months after issuance. In a volatile stock market, RSUs continue to provide value when other forms of equity such as stock options may 
-75-
not, which the Compensation Committee believes is useful in retaining talented executives in unpredictable economic times.
Stock option awards provide individuals with the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price, typically for a period of seven years, subject to continued employment with our company. Stock options vest in six-month increments over a four-year period. We believe that meaningful vesting periods encourage recipients to remain with our company over the long-term and, because the value of the awards is based on our stock price, stock options encourage recipients to focus on achievement of longer-term goals, such as strategic growth, business innovation and stockholder return. In general, employees whose employment terminates (other than for death or disability) before the award fully vests forfeit the unvested portions of these awards.
Target Value and Award Determination
The Compensation Committee's decisions regarding the amount and type of equity incentive compensation, the allocation of equity and relative weighting of these awards within total executive compensation have been based on advice provided by our independent compensation consultant and the Compensation Committee's understanding and individual experiences with market practices of similarly-situated companies. Equity-based incentive awards are intended to be the longer-term components of our overall executive compensation program and are designed to encourage performance by our executive officers over several years.
To determine the size of the equity awards, the Compensation Committee first determined the total number of shares that would be available for the annual equity awards to all proposed recipients. The total number of shares was determined by consideration of the potential dilution to our stockholders and average burn rate of other companies in our industry. The Compensation Committee utilized the grant data from the peer group and other information provided by Pay Governance to assist it in determining the size of the overall equity pool for our company as well as the individual grants to the named executive officers.
To determine the size of the individual annual equity awards, the Compensation Committee, utilizing data provided by Pay Governance, compared the long-term equity incentive compensation levels of our executives with similar positions within our peer group and survey data to determine the long-term equity incentive compensation amount for each executive. The Compensation Committee reviews market data at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile.  In finalizing the amounts of the annual equity awards, the Compensation Committee considers this market data, the CEO's recommendations, the burn rate of the executive grants, and the degree to which those amounts would be aligned with our goals of motivating and retaining key employees.

[END TABLE]
As in fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee retained the use of time-based RSUs as part of the equity mix for fiscal 2018.  The RSUs awarded as part of the fiscal 2018 equity program were issued in January 2018. The Compensation Committee awarded these RSUs as a dollar amount, which were then converted to RSUs based on our closing stock price on the date of grant. Our stock price on the date these RSUs were issued was $50.69, significantly above our stock price on November 30, 2018.
Stock option grants are intended to correlate executive compensation to our long-term success as measured by our stock price. Stock options are tied to our future success because options granted have an exercise price equal to the closing market value at the date of grant and will only provide value to the extent that the price of our stock increases above the exercise price.  As a result, the Compensation Committee viewed stock options as a form of performance equity, but with a longer-term focus than PSUs tied to an annual performance metric.
The stock options awarded as part of the fiscal 2018 equity program were issued in January 2018.  The Compensation Committee awarded these stock options as a dollar amount, which were then converted to 
-77-
stock options based on the Black-Scholes value of our stock options on the date of grant.  The exercise price of these stock options is $50.69, our closing stock price on the date of grant, significantly above our stock price on November 30, 2018.
In October 2018, upon the recommendation of Mr. Gupta, the Compensation Committee issued special one-time equity awards consisting of time-based restricted stock units with a value of $200,000 to each of Messrs. Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett.  One-third of these restricted stock units will vest on October 1, 2019 and the remainder will vest in four equal semi-annual installments beginning April 1, 2020. These awards were part of a larger special one-time equity award issued to approximately ten key employees who were identified as critical to the achievement of our new strategy.  Messrs. Gupta and Jalbert did not receive a special one-time equity award.   The purpose of these awards was to encourage recipients to maintain their employment with us and to enhance their equity position in our company in light of their short tenure.  The Compensation Committee also considered that the fiscal 2018 annual equity program was issued at a time when our stock price approximated our all-time highest stock price.
In January 2014, the Compensation Committee approved a long-term equity incentive compensation plan consisting of the grant of PSUs earned based on performance over a three-year measurement period.  In fiscal 2017, the number of shares earned was determined by comparing our relative TSR for the relevant period to the relative TSR of the component companies of the NASDAQ Software Index.  In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained the three-year LTIP PSUs, but reduced the weighting of the TSR metric from 100% to 50% and added a three-year cumulative operating income metric, weighted at 50%. The Compensation Committee also included, with respect to the operating income metric, a 35% annual operating margin threshold for payout. In designing the operating income metric to include both operating margin dollar and percentage goals, the Compensation Committee sought to ensure discipline and reinforce, consistent with our stated strategy, that profitable growth and margin expansion/maintenance are key to long-term value creation.
With respect to the relative TSR metric, the Compensation Committee left unchanged the payout scale established in fiscal 2017 to reflect current trends and stockholder-friendly practices (e.g., above-median performance required to achieve target payout). Participants can earn between 0% and 200% (the payout cap under the LTIP) of the target amount of PSUs attributable to the relative TSR metric. The cumulative three-year TSR measure compares the TSR of our common stock against the TSR of companies included in the NASDAQ Software Index during the three-year period. Our relative TSR performance must be at the 55th percentile of the index group in order for 100% of the target award to be earned.  Additionally, regardless of our relative position with respect to the NASDAQ Software Index, the award with respect to the TSR metric will be reduced by 50% if our absolute TSR over the measurement period is negative.
With respect to the operating income metric, participants can earn between 0% and 200% of the target amount of PSUs attributable to the operating income metric. The cumulative three-year operating income measure is based on the sum of the operating income amounts for 2018, 2019 and 2020 contained in our 
-78-
2018 strategic plan. We must achieve 100% of the operating income target for a given performance period in order for payout with respect to this metric to occur.  Furthermore, with respect to the operating income metric, the 35% annual operating margin threshold "performance gatekeeper" applies at all levels of performance and requires that annual operating margin be at or above 35% for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020 or no payout can occur with respect to this metric, regardless of cumulative operating income performance. The below table sets forth the payout schedules for the 2018 LTIP:
[BEGIN TABLE]% of Target Earned* 
Performance Metric Weight Factor 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 
Relative TSR Performance (% Rank) 50% <35% 35% 55% 75% 90%

[END TABLE]
*   Award interpolated for performance within stated percentiles 
** $ amounts in millions and using budget exchange rates. In addition, if operating margin in any of the three annual periods of the performance period is less than 35%, the operating income metric earned will be zero. 
The three-year performance period with respect to the LTIP awarded in 2016 expired on November 30, 2018. Based on the price of our common stock for the thirty-day trading period ending November 30, 2018, our TSR compared to the NASDAQ Software Index for the same period placed us below the 50th percentile, meaning that none of the 2016 PSUs awarded as the LTIP were earned.  As a result, all of the 2016 PSUs awarded as the LTIP were canceled.  For the February 2018 award under the LTIP, the three-year comparison period commenced on December 1, 2017 and will end on November 30, 2020.
Consistent with the Compensation Committee's philosophy that a significant portion of the equity mix to named executive officers should be tied to our long-term performance, the Compensation Committee determined that there should be no change to the equity mix determined for fiscal 2017. Accordingly, the equity mix for fiscal 2018 remained 50% LTIP PSUs, 30% RSUs and 20% stock options.

Other Executive Compensation Matters 
[END TABLE]
Timing of Equity Grants
We do not time grants either to take advantage of a depressed stock price or in anticipation of an increase in stock price and have limited the amount of discretion that can be exercised in connection with the timing of awards. We generally make awards only on pre-determined dates to ensure that awards cannot be timed to take advantage of material non-public information.
Equity awards may be made only by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee makes awards only at Committee meetings and awards are generally not effective in trading blackout periods 
-79-
(the period encompassing ten days prior to the end of each fiscal quarter through 48 hours after the earnings for that quarter are announced).
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In January 2018, our Board of Directors adopted revised stock ownership guidelines for our senior executive officers, including our named executive officers. These guidelines provide for the Chief Executive Officer to hold an amount of our common stock, restricted shares, stock options and/or earned performance shares having a value equal to at least three times his or her base salary.  For other senior executive officers, the stock ownership requirement is at least one times his or her base salary.  Executive officers have five years to attain the applicable ownership threshold.
Compensation Recovery Policy
We have adopted a clawback policy providing that in the event of a material restatement of financial statements triggered by executive-level misconduct, we may require that the bonuses and other incentive compensation paid to that executive be forfeited. The amount of incentive compensation subject to recovery would be the amount in excess of what the executive officer would have earned in accordance with the restatement, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Hedging and Pledging Policy
Our policies explicitly prohibit our directors and executive officers from "hedging" their ownership by engaging in short sales or trading in any derivatives involving our securities. Our policies also prohibit our directors and executive officers from "pledging" their ownership by holding our stock in a margin account or pledging our stock as collateral for a loan.
Tax and Accounting Considerations and Compensation Recovery Policies
Deductibility of Executive Compensation.  Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that public companies may deduct in any one year with respect to certain of their named executive officers. Through fiscal 2017, certain performance-based compensation approved by stockholders was not subject to this deduction limit. With the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, however, the performance-based compensation exemption has been eliminated, except with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that it is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders to maintain flexibility in our approach to executive compensation in order to structure a program that we consider to be the most effective in attracting, motivating and retaining key executives.
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code imposes additional significant taxes in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider receives "deferred compensation" that does not satisfy the requirements of Section 409A. Our severance and change in control 
-80-
agreements described below, including the Employee Retention and Motivation Agreements we entered into with our named executive officers, contain provisions that are intended to either avoid the application of Section 409A or, to the extent doing so is not possible, comply with the applicable Section 409A requirements. The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to change the severance guidelines applicable to executive officers to the extent necessary to avoid the application of Section 409A or comply with applicable Section 409A requirements.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards, less the present value of expected dividends, measured at the grant date and recognized over the relevant service period. We estimate the fair value of each stock-based award on the measurement date using either the current market price of the stock, the Black-Scholes option valuation model, or the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation model.

Analysis of Risk Associated with Our Compensation Plans 
[END TABLE]
In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the risks to our stockholders and to the achievement of our goals that may be inherent in the compensation plans and programs for all employees, including our executives. When evaluating our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers whether the program is based on the appropriate philosophy, benchmarked against the appropriate peer group and balanced between long and short-term performance targets, company and individual performance. Although a significant portion of our executives' compensation is performance-based and "at-risk," we believe our compensation plans and programs are appropriately structured so as not to encourage our employees to take excessive or unreasonable risks.
We considered the following elements of our compensation plans and policies when evaluating whether such plans and policies are structured to encourage our employees to take unreasonable risks:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A detailed planning process with executive or Compensation Committee oversight exists for all compensation programs. 
• The proportion of an employee's performance-based pay increases as the responsibility and potential impact of the employee's position increases, which structure is in line with market practices. 
• Compensation consists of both fixed and variable components. The fixed portion (i.e., base salary) and variable portion (i.e., performance-based bonus and equity awards) provide a mix of compensation intended to produce corporate performance without encouraging excessive risks. 
• We set performance goals that we believe are aggressive and consistent with building long-term stockholder value. 
• We use consistent corporate performance metrics from year-to-year rather than changing the metric to take advantage of changing market conditions. 
[END TABLE]
-83-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our short-term incentive plans are capped as to the maximum potential payout, which we believe mitigates excessive risk taking by limiting bonus payments even if we dramatically exceed the performance targets. 
• The time-based vesting for RSUs and stock options ensures that our executives' interests align with those of our stockholders for the long-term performance of our company. 
• Assuming achievement of at least a minimum level of performance, payouts under our performance-based plans result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, rather than an "all-or-nothing" approach. 
• In accordance with our written stock option grant policy, all equity grants must occur at a meeting of the Compensation Committee and management has no authority to issue equity. 
• The Compensation Committee retains and does not delegate any of its power to determine matters of executive compensation. 
• We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that amounts are earned and paid in accordance with our plans and programs. 
• We do not allow our executives and directors to hedge their exposure to ownership of, or interest in, our stock. We also do not allow them to engage in speculative transactions with respect to our stock.

In the case of the grants made on October 15, 2018, represents RSUs that vest, so long as the executive continues to be employed with us, according to the following schedule: one-third of the RSUs vest approximately 12 months after the date of issuance and the remainder vest in four equal semiannual installments beginning approximately 18 months after the date of issuance. 
(5) Represents stock options that vest, so long as the executive continues to be employed with us, in eight equal installments over four years beginning approximately nine months after date of issuance. 
(6) In the case of RSUs and LTIP PSUs, represents the fair value of the awards, less the present value of expected dividends, measured at the grant date.  In the case of stock options, the grant date fair value is equal to the number of shares subject to the option multiplied by the fair value of our options on the date of grant determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the Black-Scholes value of our options are described in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report.

Narrative Description of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
[END TABLE]
The material terms of our named executive officers' annual compensation, including base salaries, cash incentive plan, time-based RSUs, stock options and Long-Term Incentive Plan PSUs and the explanations of the amounts of salary, cash incentives, and equity values in proportion to total compensation are described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this proxy statement.
As discussed in greater detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this proxy statement, the 2018 non-equity incentive awards were granted pursuant to the Fiscal 2018 Corporate Bonus Plan, with amounts to be earned based on the achievement of certain financial targets.  In fiscal 2018, we exceeded the target level of performance under our bonus plan with respect to both the non-GAAP operating income metric and the adjusted free cash flow metric, but failed to meet the threshold level of performance under the non-GAAP revenue metric, which resulted in an overall payout percentage of 62% with respect to the annual cash bonus.
As discussed in greater detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this proxy statement, the PSUs awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan will be earned based on the results achieved during the 
-88-
three year performance period as determined following our 2020 fiscal year, contingent upon each named executive officer's continued service.
Except as stated in Note 3, the RSUs granted to our named executive officers in 2018 vest in equal installments every six months over three years, subject to continued employment. There is no purchase price associated with performance share or RSU awards.  The stock options granted to our named executive officers in 2018 vest in equal installments every six months over four years, subject to continued employment.  The stock options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.

Severance and Change in Control Agreements 
[END TABLE]
We have agreements with, or guidelines applicable to, our executive officers that provide the benefits described below in connection with certain terminations of employment or a change in control of our company. We do not provide excise tax gross-ups to our executive officers under these or any other agreements.
Mr. Gupta's Executive Employment Agreement
In connection with his appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer, we and Mr. Gupta entered into an employment agreement, effective as of October 10, 2016, setting forth Mr. Gupta's compensation and certain other terms. Mr. Gupta's employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated because of an "involuntary termination," he will be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of cash severance equal to 18 months of total target cash compensation as of the date of termination, which will be paid over 18 months;  
[END TABLE]
-91-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the continuation, for a period of 18 months, of benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits (medical, dental, and vision) that were in effect immediately prior to termination; and  
• 18 months of acceleration of unvested stock options and RSUs (but not unvested performance equity).  
[END TABLE]
Receipt of the severance and benefits is subject to the execution of a standard separation and release agreement. Separation payments upon any involuntary termination within twenty-four months following a change in control would be governed by the Employee Retention and Motivation Agreement described below and not by Mr. Gupta's employment agreement.
An "involuntary termination" is defined in the employment agreement as a termination of employment by us other than for cause, disability or death or a termination by Mr. Gupta as a result of certain events occurring without his consent such as an assignment to him of duties or a significant reduction of his duties, either of which is materially inconsistent with his position prior to the assignment or reduction, or the removal of Mr. Gupta from that position, a material reduction in Mr. Gupta's base salary or target bonus, a relocation of Mr. Gupta to a facility or location more than fifty miles from his then present location, or a material breach of the employment agreement by us.
Mr. Gupta's employment agreement also includes non-competition and related covenants. The non-competition covenant will be in effect for the duration of the period in which severance and other benefits are paid. The non-competition covenant relates to certain businesses with similar product areas and activities as our company.
Mr. Gupta's Employee Retention and Motivation Agreement
We and Mr. Gupta have also entered into an Employee Retention and Motivation Agreement ("Gupta ERMA"), which provides certain compensation and benefits if his employment is involuntarily terminated within 24 months of a change in control of our company. If an involuntary termination of Mr. Gupta's employment occurs under other circumstances, the severance terms of his employment agreement, as described above, would control and not the Gupta ERMA.
Change in Control Benefits. Under the Gupta ERMA, upon a change in control of our company, Mr. Gupta would be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of his annual target cash bonus on a pro-rata basis with respect to the elapsed part of the relevant fiscal year;  
• accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options and RSUs, unless the acquirer assumes all such options and restricted equity. If such outstanding stock options and shares of restricted equity held by Mr. Gupta are continued by us or assumed by our successor entity, then vesting will continue in its usual course; and 
[END TABLE]
-92-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated determination of PSUs earned under outstanding LTIPs, unless the acquirer assumes such LTIPs.  Upon the change in control, our Compensation Committee will determine the number of PSUs that are eligible to be earned based on the actual attainment of the relevant metrics as of the change in control.  Those PSUs determined to be earned will not become fully vested until the conclusion of the original three-year performance period, subject to the continued employment of Mr. Gupta through such date. 
[END TABLE]
Involuntary Termination Following Change in Control.  In the event of an involuntary termination within twenty-four (24) months following a change in control, Mr. Gupta would be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of cash severance equal to 24 months of total target cash compensation as of the date of termination, which will be paid over 24 months;  
• the continuation, for a period of 24 months, of benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits (medical, dental, and vision) that were in effect immediately prior to termination;  
• accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options and RSUs; and 
• accelerated payout of PSUs determined to be earned under LTIPs outstanding as of the change in control. 
[END TABLE]
In the event that any amounts provided for under the Gupta ERMA or otherwise payable to Mr. Gupta would constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and be subject to the related excise tax, Mr. Gupta would be entitled to receive either full payment of the benefits under the agreement or such lesser amount which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greatest amount of after-tax benefits to Mr. Gupta.
Mr. Jalbert's Executive Employment Agreement
In connection with his appointment as our Chief Financial Officer, we and Mr. Jalbert entered into an employment agreement, effective as of March 24, 2017, setting forth Mr. Jalbert's compensation and certain other terms. Mr. Jalbert's employment agreement provides that in the event that his employment is terminated as a result of an "involuntary termination," he will be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of cash severance equal to 12 months of total target cash compensation as of the date of termination, which will be paid over 12 months;  
• the continuation, for a period of 12 months, of benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits (medical, dental, and vision) that were in effect immediately prior to termination; 
• 12 months of acceleration of unvested stock options and RSUs (but not unvested performance equity); and 
[END TABLE]
-93-
[BEGIN TABLE]
• one-fourth acceleration of Mr. Jalbert's special RSU award, if the termination occurs prior to March 24, 2018 and one-half acceleration of Mr. Jalbert's special RSU award, if the termination occurs after March 24, 2018 but prior to March 24, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Receipt of the severance and benefits is subject to the execution of a standard separation and release agreement. Separation payments upon any involuntary termination within twelve months following a change in control would be governed by the Employee Retention and Motivation Agreement described below and not by Mr. Jalbert's employment agreement.
An "involuntary termination" is defined in the employment agreement as a termination of employment by us other than for cause, disability or death or a termination by Mr. Jalbert as a result of certain events occurring without his consent such as an assignment to him of duties, a significant reduction of his duties, either of which is materially inconsistent with his position prior to the assignment or reduction, or the removal of Mr. Jalbert from that position, a material reduction in Mr. Jalbert's base salary or target bonus, a relocation of Mr. Jalbert to a facility or location more than fifty miles from his then present location, or a material breach of the employment agreement by us.
Mr. Jalbert's employment agreement also includes non-competition and related covenants. The non-competition covenant will be in effect for the duration of the period in which severance and other benefits are paid. The non-competition covenant relates to certain businesses with similar product areas and activities as our company.
Executive Severance Guidelines
We have adopted severance guidelines applicable to our executive officers, including the named executive officers other than Messrs. Gupta and Jalbert. Any severance payable to Messrs. Gupta and Jalbert is governed by the employment agreements described above. Our executive severance guidelines provide that upon an involuntary termination and the execution of a standard release of claims, an executive officer is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the payment of cash severance equal to 12 months of total target cash compensation as of the date of termination, which will be paid over 12 months;  
• the continuation, for a period of 12 months, of benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits (medical, dental, and vision) that were in effect immediately prior to termination; and  
• 12 months of acceleration of unvested stock options and RSUs (but not unvested performance equity).  
[END TABLE]
Severance payments and benefits upon any involuntary termination within 12 months following a change in control are governed by the Employee Retention and Motivation Agreement described below.
The payment of severance and other benefits is conditioned upon the executive agreeing to non-competition, non-disparagement and related covenants. The non-competition covenant would be in effect for one year following the termination of employment. In connection with the termination of employment of an 
-94-
executive officer, all PSUs awarded to that executive officer relating to annual performance or under our Long-Term Incentive Plan are canceled.
Other Employee Retention and Motivation Agreements
We have entered into an ERMA with each of our other named executive officers. Each agreement is substantially identical to the Gupta ERMA except that upon the involuntary termination of the executive officer within 12 months following a change of control, the executive officer will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 15 months of his total target compensation and his benefits will continue for 15 months. Mr. Jalbert's ERMA contains the same terms with respect to accelerated vesting upon a change in control as the Gupta ERMA. For all ERMAs entered into after October 2014 (other than Mr. Gupta's), accelerated vesting upon a change in control is limited to twelve months of accelerated vesting. Under no circumstances would any of our executive officers be entitled to a gross-up payment under the ERMAs for any excise taxes to which he or she may be subject if any of the above payments and benefits are considered to be "parachute payments."
Estimate of Severance and Change in Control Benefits
The following table indicates the estimated payments and benefits that each of Messrs. Gupta, Jalbert, Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett would have received under (a) their respective employment agreements, in the case of Messrs. Gupta and Jalbert, (b) our severance guidelines applicable to executive officers, in the case of Messrs. Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett, and (c) their respective ERMAs, assuming that the change of control of our company and/or termination of his employment occurred at November 30, 2018.
These amounts are estimates only and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts that would be paid to the named executive officer, which would only be known at the time that he becomes entitled to such payment.

[END TABLE]
-96-
each unvested stock option and the closing price of our common stock on November 30, 2018, which was $35.16. In the event of an Involuntary Termination, all unvested performance share units awarded to an individual under our Long-Term Incentive Plan are canceled.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) In the event of a change in control, there is no accelerated vesting of options or RSUs provided that the acquirer assumes all existing, outstanding stock options and RSUs of the individual. These tables have been prepared under that assumption. However, if the acquirer does not assume all existing, outstanding stock options and RSUs of the individual, in the case of Messrs. Gupta and Jalbert, all unvested stock options and RSUs become fully vested and the values of stock options and RSUs indicated in the third column would apply upon a change in control, and in the case of Messrs. Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett, there is limited (12 month) accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs, and the values of stock options and RSUs indicated in the first column would apply upon a change of control. The amounts shown in the first and third columns are calculated using the exercise price for each unvested stock option and the closing price of our common stock on November 30, 2018, which was $35.16. For purposes of computing amounts attributable to accelerated vesting, the second and third columns exclude all unvested performance share units awarded under our Long-Term Incentive Plan as those amounts are undeterminable. 
(3) Represents the estimated value (based on the cost as of November 30, 2018) of continuing benefits (medical, dental, and vision) for: 
• 18 months in the case of an involuntary termination of Mr. Gupta's employment, 24 months in the case of an involuntary termination in connection with a change in control; 
• 12 months in the case of an involuntary termination of employment of Messrs. Jalbert, Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett, other than in connection with a change in control; and 
• 15 months, in the case of an involuntary termination in connection with a change in control with respect to Messrs. Jalbert, Ainsworth, Quinn and Tcherevik and Ms. Jarrett.

[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. The 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO Mr. Gupta is $4,810,311, the 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee is $67,539, and the ratio of these amounts is 71 to 1.
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system of record and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different 
-97-
employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
For purposes of identifying our median compensated employee, we used our global employee population as of November 1, 2018, identified based on our human resources system of record. We utilized total direct compensation as our consistently applied compensation measure. In this context, total direct compensation means the applicable annual fixed pay determined as of November 1, 2018, the annual incentive cash target amount or commission target amount payable for service in 2018, and the approved value of the annual equity awards granted during 2018. To identify our median compensated employee, we then calculated the total direct compensation for our global employee population, converted other currencies to US dollars and ordered the employees based on their total direct compensation.
To compute the pay ratio, we then calculated both the CEO and median employee's annual total compensation, pursuant to the proxy disclosure rules, and compared the annual total compensation of the CEO to that of the median employee.

(2) Includes 912,000 restricted stock units under our 2008 Plan.  Does not include purchase rights accruing under the ESPP because the purchase price (and therefore the number of shares to be purchased) will not be determined until the end of the purchase period. 
(3) Includes 590,000 shares available for future issuance under the ESPP. 
(4) Consists of the 2002 Nonqualified Stock Plan and the 2004 Inducement Plan described below. 
[END TABLE]
We have adopted two equity compensation plans, the 2002 Nonqualified Stock Plan and the 2004 Inducement Stock Plan, for which the approval of stockholders was not required. We intend that the 2004 Inducement Stock Plan be reserved for persons to whom we may issue securities as an inducement to become employed by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Executive officers and members of the Board of Directors are not eligible for awards under the 2002 Nonqualified Stock Plan. An executive officer would be eligible to receive an award under the 2004 Inducement Stock Plan only as an inducement to join us. Awards under the 2002 Nonqualified Stock Plan and the 2004 Inducement Stock Plan may include nonqualified stock options, grants of conditioned stock, unrestricted grants of stock, grants of stock contingent upon the attainment of performance goals and stock appreciation rights. A total of 11,250,000 shares are issuable under the two plans, of which 1,233,190 shares are available for future issuance.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and holders of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock. These reporting persons are required by regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all such filings. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms that we have received, and on written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that, with respect to the fiscal year ended 
-102-
November 30, 2018, our directors, officers, and 10% stockholders complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements, with the exceptions noted below.

OTHER MATTERS
Our Board of Directors knows of no other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons appointed as proxies for the meeting intend to vote the shares represented by that proxy in accordance with their best judgment on such matters.
PROPOSALS OF STOCKHOLDERS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting must, in order to be included in our proxy statement and the form of proxy for the 2020 Annual Meeting, be received at our principal executive offices by November 30, 2019.
Under our Bylaws, any stockholder intending to present any proposal (other than a proposal made by, or at the direction of, our Board of Directors) at the 2020 Annual Meeting, must give written notice of that proposal (including certain information about any nominee or matter proposed and the proposing stockholder) to our Secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day (February 10, 2020) nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day (January 10, 2020) prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's Annual Meeting. However, in the event that the date of the Annual Meeting is advanced by more than 30 days before or delayed by more than 30 days after that anniversary date, the notice must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made.
EXPENSES OF SOLICITATION
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies. In addition to soliciting stockholders by mail, we will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by them. Our directors, officers and regular employees may, without additional compensation, solicit stockholders in person or by mail, telephone, facsimile, or otherwise following the original solicitation. We may engage a proxy solicitation firm in connection with the Annual Meeting, in which case, the fees and expenses associated with any such proxy solicitation firm will be paid by us.

(1)Acquisition-related revenue constitutes revenue reflected as pre-acquisition deferred revenue under prior accounting guidance that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of acquisitions. Since GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue, GAAP results alone do not fully capture all of our economic activities. Note that acquisition-related revenue adjustments relate to Progress' OpenEdge and Application Development and Deployment business segments for Kinvey and Telerik, respectively. Upon our adoption of ASC 606 in fiscal year 2019, our GAAP revenue and Non-GAAP revenue results are the same. 
(2)Loss on assets held for sale represents two buildings on our Bedford campus that the Company is actively marketing and intends to sell within one year. GAAP accounting requires long-lived assets designated as held for sale to be measured at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less cost to sell. As this loss is not part of our core operating results and is infrequent in nature, we exclude it to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our operating performance in other periods.
