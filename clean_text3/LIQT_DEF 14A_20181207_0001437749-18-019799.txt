PROXY STATEMENT
LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.
Industriparken 22C
DK2750 Ballerup, Denmark
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card are being furnished with respect to the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of LiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company" or "LiqTech") for the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held at 3:00 p.m., local time on Friday, December 7, 2018, and at any adjournment or adjournments thereof, at the corporate headquarters of the Company at Industriparken 22C, DK2750 Ballerup, Denmark.
The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and form of proxy are intended to be sent or given to the stockholders is November 7, 2018. These proxy materials are also available free of charge on the internet at https://materials.proxyvote.com/53632A. Stockholders are invited to attend the Meeting to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. However, stockholders do not need to attend the Meeting to vote. Instead, stockholders may simply complete, sign and return the proxy card in the enclosed postage paid envelope.
We will bear the expense of solicitation of proxies for the Meeting, including the printing and mailing of this Proxy Statement. We may request persons, and reimburse them for their expenses with respect thereto, who hold stock in their name or custody or in the names of nominees for others to forward copies of such materials to those persons for whom they hold Common Stock (as defined below) and to request authority for the execution of the proxies. In addition, some of our officers, directors and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board personally or by mail, telephone or facsimile.
VOTING SECURITIES, VOTING AND PROXIES
Record Date
Only stockholders of record of the Company's common stock, $0.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), as of the close of business on October 31, 2018 (the "Record Date") are entitled to notice and to vote at the Meeting and any adjournment or adjournments thereof.
Voting Stock
As of the Record Date, there were 72,905,547 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Each holder of Common Stock on the Record Date is entitled to one vote for each share then held on the matters to be voted at the Meeting. No other class of voting securities was then outstanding.
Quorum
The presence at the Meeting of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, in person or by proxy, is required for a quorum. Should you submit a proxy, even though you abstain as to the proposal, or you are present in person at the Meeting, your shares shall be counted for the purpose of determining if a quorum is present.
Broker "non-votes" are included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum of shares is present at the Meeting. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holder, such as a brokerage firm, bank or trust company, holding shares of record for a beneficial owner, does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
Voting
The election of directors requires the approval of a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting. Action on all other matters, including, without limitation, the ratification of the appointment of Sadler, Gibb & Associates, L.L.C. ("Sadler") as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 and the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, requires the approval of a majority of votes cast at the Meeting. For purposes of these proposals, abstentions and broker "non-votes" will have no effect on the outcome.
If you are the beneficial owner, but not the registered holder of our shares of Common Stock, you cannot directly vote those shares at the Meeting. You must provide voting instructions to your nominee holder, such as your brokerage firm or bank.
If you wish to vote in person at the Meeting but you are not the record holder, you must obtain from your record holder a "legal proxy" issued in your name and bring it to the Meeting. At the Meeting, ballots will be distributed with respect to the proposals to each stockholder (or the stockholder's proxy if not the management proxy holders) who is present and did not deliver a proxy to the management proxy holders or another person. The ballots shall then be tallied, one vote for each share owned of record, the votes for the election of directors being either "FOR" or "WITHHOLD VOTE" (where stockholders may withhold such vote by writing the names of such nominee(s) in a space provided on the ballot), and the votes for the ratification of the appointment of Sadler and the advisory votes for the compensation of our named executive officers being either "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN."
Proxies
The form of proxy solicited by the Board affords you the ability to specify a choice among approval of, disapproval of, or abstention with respect to, the matters to be acted upon at the Meeting. Shares represented by the proxy will be voted and, where the solicited stockholder indicates a choice with respect to the matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted as specified. If no choice is given, a properly executed proxy will be voted in favor of the proposals.
Revocability of Proxies
Even if you execute a proxy, you retain the right to revoke it and change your vote by notifying us at any time before your proxy is voted. Such revocation may be effected by execution of a subsequently dated proxy, or by a written notice of revocation, sent to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the address of the corporate headquarters of the Company set forth above in the Notice to this Proxy Statement or your attendance and voting at the Meeting. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by the proxies, if received in time, will be voted in accordance with the directions given therein.
You are requested, regardless of the number of shares you own or your intention to attend the Meeting, to sign the proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed envelope.
Interest of Officers and Directors in Matters to Be Acted Upon
No person who has been a director or executive officer of the Company at any time since the beginning of our fiscal year, and no associate of any of the foregoing persons has any substantial interest, direct or indirect, in any matter to be acted upon.
Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal
Under the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, stockholders are not entitled to any appraisal or similar rights of dissenters with respect to any of the proposals to be acted upon at the Meeting.
PROPOSAL ONE
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board is currently comprised of five (5) members. We are therefore recommending the election of five of our existing Board members at the Meeting. Our Bylaws provide for the authorization of up to eight (8) directors. Any vacancies in the Board may be exclusively filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors, though less than quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Each director so elected shall hold office for the balance of the term to which such director is elected.
The Board has recommended for election current directors Mark Vernon, Sune Mathiesen, Alexander J. Buehler, Peyton Boswell and Joel Gay (each, a "Nominee" and collectively, the "Nominees"). If elected at the Meeting, each director would serve until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and his successor is duly elected and qualified.
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the Nominees. In the event that any nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as the Board may propose. Each of the Nominees has agreed to serve if elected, and we have no reason to believe that they will be unable to serve.

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Sadler, Gibb & Associates, L.L.C. ("Sadler") as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Services provided to the Company by our independent registered public accountants during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 are described under "Audit-Related Matters—Auditor Fees and Services" herein below.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Sadler as our independent registered public accountants.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on this item will be required for approval. Abstentions will be counted as represented and entitled to vote and will therefore have the effect of a negative vote.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR"
THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF SADLER, GIBB & ASSOCIATES, L.L.C.
AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018
In the event stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee and the Board. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
PROPOSAL THREE
ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") added Section 14A to Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules.
Our executive officer compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success, while working within the available resources. Our compensation committee, along with our Board, believes that they have taken a responsible approach to compensating our named executive officers given our limited resources.
Please read the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement for additional details about our executive compensation program. The compensation of our named executive officers is designed to enable us to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead us successfully in a competitive environment. Our Board believes that our executive compensation strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our named executive officers to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders.
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the compensation committee or our Board. Our Board values the views of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining future compensation arrangements for our named executive officers.
Our current policy, as voted on by our stockholders in 2015, is to hold a say-on-pay vote every three years. The next say-on-pay vote will take place at our annual meeting in 2021, at which time our stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the frequency of our future say-on-pay votes.
Vote Required for Approval 
This vote is an advisory vote and is therefore not binding on the Company or the Board of Directors. The vote required for approval of the compensation of our named executive officers is the affirmative vote of the majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on this item. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR"
THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS
DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee met four times.
The Audit Committee has (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management; (ii) discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, as amended; and (iii) received the written disclosures and letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence. Based on such review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Compensation Committee
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mark Vernon (Chairman), Alexander J. Buehler and Peyton Boswell, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the NYSE American rules, a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), and an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We have implemented a written charter for our Compensation Committee, available at www.liqtech.com, which provides that our Compensation Committee is responsible for:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviewing and making recommendations to our Board regarding our compensation policies and forms of compensation provided to our directors and officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviewing and assisting the Board and Management in enforcing the prohibition on loans by the company to officers and directors;

● such other matters that are specifically delegated to the Compensation Committee by our Board after the business combination from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has the principal responsibility for the compensation plans of the Company, particularly as applied to the compensation of executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee Charter sets forth the authority and responsibilities of the Committee for the performance evaluation and compensation of the Company's CEO, executive officers and directors, and significant compensation arrangements, plans, policies and programs of the Company. The Committee has authority to retain such outside counsel, experts and other advisors as it determines to be necessary to carry out its responsibilities, including the authority to approve an external advisor's fees and other retention terms on behalf of the Company. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, the Company shall provide appropriate funding to the Committee, as determined by the Committee in its capacity as a Committee of the Board, for payment of compensation to any outside advisors engaged by the Committee.
The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation and evaluates the CEO's performance in light of such goals and objectives. Based on this evaluation the Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the CEO; (ii) the grant of all cash based bonuses and equity compensation to the CEO; (iii) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the CEO; (iv) any CEO severance or change in control arrangement; and (v) any other CEO compensation matters as from time to time directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the CEO's compensation, the Committee considers the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at companies that the Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company's CEO in prior years.
The Committee also meets with the CEO within 90 days after the commencement of each fiscal year to discuss the compensation programs to be in effect for the Company's executive officers for such fiscal year and to review and approve the corporate goals and objectives relevant to those programs. In light of these goals and objectives, the Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the executive officers; (ii) the grant of cash-based bonuses and equity compensation provided to the executive officers; (iii) performance targets for executive officers; (iv) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the executive officers; (v) executive officers' severance or change in control arrangements; and (vi) any other executive officer compensation matters as from time to time directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the executive officer's compensation, the Committee considers the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to executive officers at companies that the Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company's executive officers in prior years.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Compensation Committee met two times.

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● recommending that the Board establish special committees as necessary; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviewing annually and reassessing the adequacy of our Governance and Nominating Committee Charter.  
[END TABLE]
In making nominations, the Governance and Nominating Committee intends to submit candidates who have high personal and professional integrity, who have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who are effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. In evaluating nominees, the Governance and Nominating Committee intends to take into consideration attributes such as leadership, independence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, business experiences, industry knowledge, and diversity of viewpoints.
One of the primary responsibilities of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to make appropriate recommendations to the Board for the appointment or re-appointment of directors. The Company seeks to have directors who, in addition to relevant technical, commercial and securities expertise, meet the highest standards of personal integrity, judgment and critical thinking, and an ability to work in an open environment with other directors to further the interests of the Company and its shareholders. In recommending appointments to the Board, the Committee is mindful of the overall balance of the skills, knowledge and experience of Board members against the current and future requirements of the Company and of the benefits of diversity. The Company recognizes the importance of diversity at all levels of the Company as well as on the Board and considers overall Board balance and diversity when appointing new directors. Board appointments are, in the final analysis, made on merit.
The Company employs multiple strategies in identifying director nominees, including the obtaining of recommendations from security holders, recommendations from current directors, and from the Company's corporate advisors. The Company also utilizes professional recruitment firms, as may be required, in seeking qualified director nominees. The qualifications of director nominees are evaluated by the Governance and Nominating Committee to determine if the director nominees have the requisite technical and commercial expertise to maintain a proper balance of skills required by the Board. There are no differences in the evaluation of director nominees recommended by security holders. Director nominees are interviewed in depth by the Committee and the Board to further qualify the director nominees and evaluate the personal integrity and character of the candidate.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Governance and Nominating Committee met five times.
Director Independence
The Board has determined that Messrs. Buehler, Vernon, Gay and Boswell are independent as that term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE American. In making these determinations, our Board has concluded that none of our independent directors has an employment, business, family or other relationship which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Mr. Mathiesen is not considered independent because of his role as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and because he is a significant stockholder. We expect that our independent directors will meet in executive session (without the participation of executive officers or other non-independent directors) at least two times each year, and Mark Vernon presides over such meeting of independent directors.
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
The following is a brief description of the specific experience and qualifications, attributes or skills of each director that led to the conclusion that such person should serve as a director of the Company. Based on the attributes and skills of each director, the Company's leadership structure is appropriate. The Board plays an active role in the risk oversight of the Company.
Mr. Vernon's extensive global executive and director experience in industrial engineering businesses, particularly in the United States, Asia and Europe, provides the Board with valuable insight into the markets the Company serves, operational expertise and proven management and Board expertise. Mr. Vernon has broad public company board experience.
Mr. Mathiesen's prior experience at leading businesses as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of companies in the technical products space distinguish him as an integral part of the Company's Board and management team. He is uniquely qualified to provide a perspective on matters involving the continued growth and development of the Company.
Mr. Buehler has wide experience in general management and strategic planning as well as new product development, corporate development and operations management.  Mr. Buehler also has relevant market experience in the global water, oil & gas, and manufacturing industries . Mr. Buehler brings prior public company board experience to the LiqTech Board.  Mr. Buehler has been determined by our Board to qualify as an Audit Committee Financial Expert. 
Mr. Boswell's experience in establishing and growing successful renewable energy clean tech businesses and prior experience in investment banking provides the Board with a unique perspective on corporate finance, capital markets and strategic growth matters. Further, the Board has determined that he qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert.
Mr. Gay has executive management experience in the global water, oil & gas, and chemical industries. His significant experience in publically-traded companies provides the Board with industry specific and general managerial expertise. Mr. Gay also brings relevant direct experience in commercializing and scaling technology companies. Further, the Board has determined that he qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert.
Board Meetings
The Board held twelve meetings (including regularly scheduled and special) during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Each incumbent director attended greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which each director has been a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which each director served (during the period for which each director has been a director).
The Board encourages all of its members to attend its Board meetings.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent (10%) of a registered class of a company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater than ten percent (10%) stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, we believe that all reports under Section 16(a) required to be filed by its officers and directors and greater than ten percent (10%) beneficial owners were timely filed.
Code of Ethics 
Effective January 1, 2012, the Board adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics with the purpose of assuring that all employees and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries understand and adhere to high ethical standards of conduct. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company website at www.liqtech.com.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation Decisions
Our Compensation Committee consists of Mark Vernon (Chair), Alexander J. Buehler and Peyton Boswell, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the NYSE American rules, a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code. None of the members of the Compensation Committee was or is an officer or employee of the Company. No member of the Compensation Committee has had any relationship with us requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. None of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has an executive officer that serves on our Board or Compensation Committee.
Retirement, Post-Termination and Change in Control
We have no retirement, pension, or profit-sharing programs for the benefit of directors, officers or other employees, nor do we have post-termination or change in control arrangements with directors, officers or other employees, but our Board may recommend adoption of one or more such programs in the future.

Employment and Service Agreements
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had employment and services agreements, as applicable with Messrs. Mathiesen, Degn, Petersen. Since December 31, 2017, the agreements with each of Mr. Degn and Mr. Petersen have been terminated, and we entered into an Agreement with Mr. Toftegaard in connection with his joining as Chief Financial Officer. A description of the foregoing agreements is set forth below.
 Mathiesen Agreement
Effective July 30, 2014 the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Mathiesen to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a Director of the Company. Mr. Mathiesen was also engaged to serve as a Director of LiqTech Int. DK pursuant to a Director Contract, dated July 15, 2014, by and between Mr. Mathiesen and LiqTech Int. DK (the "Mathiesen Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Mathiesen Agreement, in consideration for his services, Mr. Mathiesen shall receive an annual base salary initially set at DKK 1,500,000 (or approximately $245,042 based on the currency exchange rate of $1 = DKK 6.1214 as of December 31, 2014). Further, he shall receive a yearly bonus of 5% of the average gross profit for LiqTech Int. DK and LiqTech Systems A/S for any sales (revenue) ≥130,000,000 DKK per year (the gross margin is fixed at 40% without depreciations). For example, the calculation will be as follows, if the revenue for certain of the Company's subsidiaries should be DKK 200,000,000 in a year and the gross profit DKK 80,000,000 (40%) the bonus would be the following: 80,000,000 minus 130,000,000 * 0.4 = 52,000,000 DKK = 28,000,000 * 0.05 = DKK 1,400,000. Mr. Mathiesen is entitled to five weeks of vacation, home internet service, a mobile phone, a laptop and reimbursement of travel expenses. We may terminate the Mathiesen Agreement upon not less than twelve months prior notice and Mr. Mathiesen may terminate the Mathiesen Agreement with twelve months prior notice effective as of the end of the month in which notice is given. The Mathiesen Agreement was irredeemable from both parties until December 31, 2016.
Degn Agreement
On June 30, 2017, Mr. Degn and the Company agreed to replace Mr. Degn's previous employment agreement in its entirety with a CFO Service Agreement, whereby Mr. Degn would be entitled to compensation at an average monthly rate of $15,400 until March 31, 2018. Mr. Degn's agreement was terminated upon his resignation, effective August 15, 2018
Petersen Agreement
Effective January 1, 2014, we entered into a Services Agreement with Mr. Petersen (the "Petersen Agreement") whereby Mr. Petersen provided on-going services to us including, participation at road shows, general investor relations services, general work as Chairman of the Board and other services which are mutually agreeable by both parties on an ad hoc basis in consideration for annual payments equal to DKK1,235,000 (or approximately $201,751 based on the currency exchange rate of $1 = DKK 6.1214 as of December 31, 2014), payable as follows: (a) DKK205,833.34 representing payment for the Services for the months of January and February, 2014; and (b) DKK102,916.67 on the final business day of each month beginning on March 31, 2014 through the end of the term. On October 30, 2017 the Company provided notice that the Petersen Agreement, would no longer remain in effect 12 months therefrom, and the Petersen Agreement has terminated as of the date hereof.
Toftegaard Agreement
Effective August 15, 2018, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Toftegaard (the "Toftegaard Agreement"), the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Toftegaard is entitled to receive an annual salary denominated in Danish Kroner of DKK1,080,000, an annual discretionary cash bonus and pension contributions of 10% of his salary, which is reviewable each year during his employment. Mr. Toftegaard is entitled to, among other things, five weeks of vacation, home internet service, a mobile phone, a laptop, a company car, and reimbursement of travel expenses.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with Related Persons
The following discussion relates to types of transactions involving our company and any of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or five percent (5%) stockholders, each of whom we refer to as a "related party." For purposes of this discussion, a "related-party transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship:
• in which we participate;
• that involves an amount in excess of the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years; and
• in which a related party has a direct or indirect material interest.
From January 1, 2017 through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no related-party transactions, except for the executive officer and director compensation arrangements described in the section "Executive Compensation" and as described below.
On or about May 12, 2017, Sandra F. Pessin and Brian Pessin, who at the time were beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, entered into subscription agreements for 2,000,000 and 1,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, of at a price of $0.25 per share for total consideration of $750,000.

Policies and Procedures for Related Party Transactions
Any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, principal stockholder, or any of such persons' immediate family members or affiliates, in which the amount involved exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of our total assets at year end for the last two completed fiscal years must first be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration and approval. All of our directors, executive officers and employees will be required to report to our Audit Committee any such related party transaction. In approving or rejecting the proposed agreement, our Audit Committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to the Audit Committee, including, but not limited to, the risks, costs and benefits to us, the terms of the transaction, the availability of other sources for comparable services or products, and, if applicable, the impact on a director's independence. Our Audit Committee will approve only those agreements that, in light of known circumstances, are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests, as our Audit Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

AUDIT-RELATED MATTERS – AUDITOR FEES AND SERVICES
Our current principal independent registered public accountant is Sadler, Gibb & Associates, L.L.C. The auditor of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 was Gregory & Associates, LLC (the "Gregory Firm"). On July 23, 2018, we terminated the services of the Gregory Firm and retained the services of Sadler as our independent registered public accounting firm.
The Gregory Firm's reports on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that such reports contained a note regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. During the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with the Gregory Firm on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to the Gregory Firm's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such periods. Furthermore, no reportable events occurred within the periods covered by the Gregory Firm's reports on the Company's financial statements, or subsequently up to the date of the Gregory Firm's dismissal. As used herein, the term "reportable event" means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and through July 23, 2018, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Sadler regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as described above. Since July 23, 2018, and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with Sadler on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to Sadler's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such periods. As used herein, the term "reportable event" means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
The Company does not expect a representative of Sadler to be present at the Meeting.
Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees & All Other Fees
The aggregate fees billed by the Gregory Firm for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016 and for the review of our quarterly financial statements were $148,894 and $151,689, respectively. To date Sadler has billed $37,500 for the review of our quarterly financial statements.
Since January 1, 2017, our auditors did not provide any tax compliance, planning services, or audit related services for the Company. Our auditors did not provide any services other than as described above. 
Audit Committee Pre-approval
The policy of the Audit Committee is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent accountants. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax fees, and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to certain committee members when expedited approval of services is necessary. The independent accountants and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent accountants in accordance with this pre-approval delegation, and the fees for the services performed to date. All of the services described above were approved in advance by the Audit Committee during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
OTHER MATTERS
Delivery of Documents to Stockholders Sharing an Address
Only one Proxy Statement is being delivered to two or more security holders who share an address, unless the Company has received contrary instruction from one or more of the security holders. The Company will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Proxy Statement to a security holder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. If you would like to request additional copies of the Proxy Statement, or if in the future you would like to receive multiple copies of information or proxy statements, or annual reports, or, if you are currently receiving multiple copies of these documents and would, in the future, like to receive only a single copy, please so instruct the Company, by writing to us at Industriparken 22C, DK2750 Ballerup, Denmark or by telephone at +45 4498-6000.

A proposal which is received after that date or which otherwise fails to meet the requirements for stockholder proposals established by the SEC will not be included. The submission of a stockholder proposal does not guarantee that it will be included in the proxy statement.
At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting (y) by or at the direction of the Board or (z) by any stockholder of the Company who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of the notice provided for in Section 1.11(b) of the Bylaws, who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.11(b) of the Bylaws.
For business to be properly brought before a stockholder meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall have been delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders (i.e., October, 9, 2018 and September 10, 2018, respectively); provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 60 days after such anniversary date then to be timely such notice must be received by the Company no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made.

(v) any material interest of the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person in such business, including all arrangements, agreements and understandings with the stockholder or Stockholder Associated Person in connection with the proposed business.
Notwithstanding anything in the Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a stockholder meeting except as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.11(b) of the Bylaws. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1.11(b) of the Bylaws, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1.11(b) of the Bylaws.
With respect to the nomination of directors, only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.11 of the Company's Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors.

The foregoing clause shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make any nomination of a person or persons for the election to the Board at an annual meeting or special meeting of the stockholders.
Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 60 days after such anniversary date, then to be timely such notice must be received by the Company no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made.

Such stockholder's notice shall set forth:
(i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and

At the request of the Board, any person nominated by the Board for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary that information required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible to serve as a director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.11(a) of the Bylaws.
The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 1.11(a) of the Bylaws, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in Section 1.11(a) of the Bylaws.
