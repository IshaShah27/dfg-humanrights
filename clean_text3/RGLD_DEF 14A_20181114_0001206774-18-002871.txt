LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Fellow Shareholder,
In fiscal 2018, investors confronted rising interest rates, global trade conflicts, tense periods of political instability, changes to the U.S. tax code and late cycle concerns about the future direction of U.S. equities. Nonetheless, the broader equity market continued to show strong performance and is nearing a record in longevity.
Most gold equities struggled under these conditions, while Royal Gold navigated this environment with a steady hand. We delivered solid, consistent financial performance resulting in a total shareholder return that beat the S&P 500, the price of gold and the gold equity indices even though the average gold price was relatively flat compared to the prior year. We achieved record cash flow, revenue, volume and dividends for the second consecutive year and delivered a total shareholder return of 20.2% in fiscal 2018.
Corporate earnings for U.S. companies (including Royal Gold) were impacted broadly by federal tax reform, as foreign income from prior years was subject to deemed repatriation and as deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted to comply with the new law. We simplified our business and reduced exchange rate volatility in our effective tax rate. Both events impacted earnings, as did an impairment of our Pascua-Lama interest. While the impairment reflects present project conditions, we continue to believe that Pascua-Lama, with 21 million ounces of resource1 on a 100% basis, represents significant option value for Royal Gold shareholders.
We invested $1.4 billion opportunistically in fiscal 2015 and 2016 to enhance our portfolio while helping our counterparties improve their balance sheets. We provided this capital out of cash on hand, cash flow and our credit facility. In fiscal 2018, we took advantage of a relatively quiet time on the business development front to pay down the balance of our credit facility, ending the year with $1.1 billion of total liquidity. In the new year, we will build our net cash balance to position the company for the next investment cycle.
We achieved record cash flow, revenue, volume and dividends for the second consecutive year and delivered a total shareholder return of 20.2% in fiscal 2018.
Tony Jensen President & CEO

We continued to invest in the Peak Gold Joint Venture ("PGJV") in Alaska. In addition to exploration activities, we commissioned a preliminary economic analysis to assess the current state of the project. These results will be available early in fiscal 2019, which should allow us to shift our focus to leveraging PGJV into value core to our business. In addition to investing in exploration and engineering at PGJV, we also acquired approximately 13.2% of the common stock of our joint venture partner, Contango ORE, Inc., to further increase our effective interest in PGJV.
Late in our fiscal year, Royal Gold also enhanced its position on Amarillo Gold's Mara Rosa project in Brazil by purchasing a 1.75% royalty, which is in addition to a 1% NSR royalty previously acquired. Supporting our existing counterparties is an important strategy for developing projects within our portfolio of nearly 200 assets, 40 of which are in production.
Our portfolio continues to grow organically. At Pueblo Viejo, Barrick is completing a pre-feasibility study to expand the processing facilities that has the potential to convert seven million ounces of gold resources into reserves on a 100% basis. At Peñasquito, Goldcorp is nearing completion of its Pyrite Leach project, which is expected to add one million ounces of gold and 44 million ounces of silver over its mine life. At Voisey's Bay, Vale announced an intention to extend the life of mine to 2034 through the development of an underground operation. At Cortez, Barrick continued stripping the Crossroads deposit, and after nearly three years of development they expect production from this deposit in mid-fiscal 2019. At Wassa, Golden Star more than doubled its inferred mineral resources to 5.2 million ounces, paving the way for potential production increases. And finally, we expect larger contributions in the future from both Mount Milligan and Rainy River as those production teams work through issues unique to each operation.
Stream and royalty financing have proven to be highly flexible. The mineral industry capital needs have shifted from the days of balance sheet restructuring. Operators looking to capitalize new investments today have relatively weak corporate currency and limited access to the traditional staple of equity capital. And with one-year LIBOR rates increasing approximately 60% during the fiscal year, the cost of debt is rising quickly as well. We believe Royal Gold's stream and royalty financing products will be an important source of capital for operators in this new environment.
Key Elements of our Business Strategy:

Royal Gold manages its business differently than many other gold equities. We focus on:
I will take this opportunity to thank Craig Haase for his 10 years of service to Royal Gold as a director on our board. Craig retired in fiscal 2018 and was instrumental to the success of Royal Gold during his tenure with the company as well as the stream and royalty business in general over his career.
Royal Gold has never been stronger and is well-positioned with portfolio scale, organic growth opportunities and strong cash flow building for new investment opportunities. It is a privilege to represent the company, and on behalf of our employees, we thank you for your support. We will continue managing our company to pursue best in class total shareholder return.
Sincerely,   Tony A. Jensen President and Chief Executive Officer

 PROPOSAL    
[END TABLE]
The Company's Board of Directors consists of three classes of Directors, with each class of Directors serving for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Company's current Class I Directors, who are standing for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting, are Messrs. Jensen and Sokalsky; the Class II Directors are Messrs. Hayes and Vance; and the Class III Directors are Ms. Veenman and Messrs. McArthur and Thompson.
If the proxy is properly completed and received in time for the Annual Meeting, and if the proxy does not indicate otherwise, the represented shares will be voted "FOR" Tony A. Jensen and Jamie C. Sokalsky. If any nominee for election as a Class I Director should refuse or be unable to serve (an event that is not anticipated), the proxy will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors. Each Class I Director elected shall serve until the 2021 Annual Meeting, or until his successor is elected and qualified.
The Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") require that each Director be elected by the majority of votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present with respect to such Director in uncontested elections. This means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a Director nominee must exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" that Director nominee. In a contested election (where the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected), the standard for election of Directors would be a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. This year's election is expected to be an uncontested election, and the majority vote standard will apply. If a nominee who is serving as a Director is not elected at the Annual Meeting, Delaware law provides that the Director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover Director." Under the Company's Bylaws, each Director nominee who is serving as a Director has submitted a conditional resignation that becomes effective if such Director is not elected and the Board accepts the resignation. In that situation, the CNG Committee would make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. The Board of Directors will act on the CNG Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. Absent a determination by the Board that it is in the best interest of the Company for a Director who fails to be elected to remain on the Board, the Board will accept the resignation. The Director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the decision of the Board of Directors. If a nominee who was not already serving as a Director fails to receive a majority of votes cast with respect to his or her election at the Annual Meeting, Delaware law provides that the nominee does not serve on the Board as a "holdover Director." Each of the Class I Director nominees are currently serving on the Board of Directors.
Information concerning the nominees for election as Directors is set forth below under "Board of Directors."

Independence of Directors
The Board of Directors determined that each Director, except for Mr. Jensen, who is the President and CEO of the Company, is "independent" under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange ("Nasdaq"). The Board of Directors also determined that the Directors designated as "independent" have no relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Director.
Board Succession, Recruitment and Nomination and Election
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1 Succession Planning  The Compensation, Nominating & Governance Committee ("CNG Committee") considers current and long-term needs of our evolving business and seeks potential Director candidates in light of emerging needs, current Board structure, tenure, skills, diversity and experience. 
 2 Identification of Candidates  The CNG Committee identifies a pool of qualified Director candidates through a robust search process, which includes use of an independent search firm, and assesses candidates' skills, experience and background. Among other qualifications, the CNG Committee considers: 
 3  Meeting with Candidates  Potential Director candidates are interviewed by the Chairman, CEO and members of the CNG Committee. 
 4  Decision and Nomination  The CNG Committee recommends, and the full Board selects nominees that are best qualified to serve the interests of the Company and the stockholders. 
 5 Election  If nominees are approved by the Board, stockholders consider the nominees for election to the Board and elect Directors, in most cases, to serve three-year terms. 
[END TABLE]
The Board is elected by stockholders to oversee management and assure that stockholders' long-term interests are being served. A significant portion of the Board's oversight responsibility is carried out through its independent Committees, the Audit and Finance Committee and the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee. All Committee members satisfy the Nasdaq and SEC definitions of Independent Director. Each Committee meets regularly throughout the year, reports its actions to the Board, receives reports from senior management, and evaluates its performance annually. Each Committee is authorized to retain outside advisors.
Board Oversight of Risk Management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company. The Board of Directors relies upon the President and CEO and other members of management to supervise day-to-day risk management. The President and CEO reports directly to the Board and certain Board Committees on such matters, as appropriate.
The Board of Directors delegates certain oversight responsibilities to its Committees. For example, while the primary responsibility for financial and other reporting, internal controls, compliance with laws and regulations, and ethics rests with the management of the Company, the Audit and Finance Committee provides risk oversight with respect to the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and controls, the selection, retention, qualifications, objectivity and independence of the independent auditors, and cybersecurity. Similarly, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee provides risk oversight with respect to the Company's compensation program, governance structure and processes, the Company's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements, and succession planning.

Proposal 1
The Board also oversees a robust enterprise risk management program designed to identify, define, manage and, when necessary, mitigate risks confronting the Company. The enterprise risk management program is administered, reviewed and updated by management on an ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Board of Directors quarterly.
Succession Planning
One of the primary responsibilities of the Board and management is to ensure that the Company has qualified leadership possessing the appropriate knowledge, experience and skills to successfully execute its business and strategic plans. Management is actively engaged in leadership development, including regular discussions concerning the development and retention of critical talent to promote future success, and the creation of opportunities for individual personal and professional development. In addition, the Board regularly reviews and discusses succession plans for both the Board and senior executives, including the President and CEO, during Board Committee meetings and executive sessions of the full Board. Directors become familiar with potential successors for senior executive positions through various means, including Board meeting presentations and less formal interactions throughout the course of the year.
The Board's practice is to prepare for planned or unplanned changes in leadership in order to ensure the long-term continuity and stability of the Company. Accordingly, the Board has well-considered options available to respond to an unexpected vacancy in the President and CEO position.
Commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility
With just 23 employees across four offices in three countries, Royal Gold's corporate footprint is modest. We nonetheless acknowledge international concerns related to climate change, sustainability and the protection of the global environment, particularly as those concerns may be influenced by the mining industry. Royal Gold is committed to preserving and protecting the environment, promoting the health and safety of our employees, and respecting local cultures and values in the communities where we invest.
We believe responsible mineral development can benefit local communities and create sustainable value for all stakeholders. As a member of the World Gold Council, we endorse the ICMM 10 Principles for sustainable development in the mining and metals industry. Our assets are passive investments, meaning that we do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream or royalty interests. However, Royal Gold seeks new investment opportunities with responsible operators, and we regard environmental stewardship and commitment to sustainability as key aspects of well-managed mining projects. Accordingly, our review of any new investment includes consideration of the operator's commitment to these fundamentals.
After we make a stream or royalty investment, we monitor the continuing effectiveness of the operators' environmental and social practices. Many of our operators implement the ICMM 10 Principles or subscribe to other international charters respecting environmental and social issues, and actively contribute in ways that positively impact the communities where they mine. We encourage their efforts and often make our own financial contributions in support of their programs.
At our Peak Gold Project in Alaska, we work with our joint venture partner to support the local Tetlin native community by funding social, environmental and other initiatives, administering secondary and post-secondary educational programs and providing other development opportunities to Tetlin village residents.
Safety, environmental stewardship and sustainability are also key elements of Royal Gold's corporate culture. Our company policies promote a safe and healthy workplace and require strict adherence to legal and ethical standards in our business practices. This culture carries beyond our offices, as a number of our current and former directors, officers and employees are active in or otherwise support educational institutions and non-profit organizations furthering such causes as promotion of community health, elimination of food insecurity and protection of at-risk children.
Stockholder Engagement
We are committed to creating long-term value for our stockholders. To ensure alignment with their best interests, we engage with our major stockholders throughout the year on a variety of topics, including our financial performance, growth strategy, corporate governance practices and our executive compensation program. Although we have always received more than majority support for our executive compensation programs, stockholder support from 2013 through 2015, in the low- to mid-70% range, was in our view unacceptable. The CNG Committee began working with its independent executive compensation consultant in early 2015 to address concerns expressed earlier by some of our stockholders and proxy advisors. Members of our management team also solicited feedback from investors representing approximately 50% of our outstanding shares concerning both our historic executive compensation program and the material program changes then under consideration. Generally, stockholders confirmed appreciation for increasingly transparent executive

compensation disclosure, support for our compensation benchmarking practices, including peer selection methodology, and support for program enhancements then under consideration.
Communication with Directors
Any stockholder who desires to contact the Company's Board of Directors may do so by writing to the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Royal Gold, Inc., 1660 Wynkoop Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado 80202.
Any such communication should state the number of shares beneficially owned by the stockholder making the communication. The Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary will forward any such communication to the Chairman of the CNG Committee and will forward such communication to other members of the Board of Directors as appropriate, provided that such communication addresses a legitimate business issue. Any communication relating to accounting, auditing or fraud will be forwarded to the Chairman of the AF Committee.
The Board of Directors does not have a prescribed policy on whether the roles of the Chairman and CEO should be separate or combined but believes that the best structure for the Company's Board of Directors at this time is to have an independent non-executive Chairman. Mr. Hayes has served as Chairman of the Board since May 2014, as Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee since November 2013, and as a Director of the Company since January 2008.
The Board believes its leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility and oversight between management and the Independent Directors.
Committees of the Board
AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE ("AF COMMITTEE")
The AF Committee is a standing Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of the following persons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 William M. Hayes, Chairman  Jamie C. Sokalsky  Christopher M.T.

[END TABLE]
Roles and Responsibilities of the Committee The AF Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and corporate policies and controls. The AF Committee has the direct responsibility to retain and terminate the Company's independent registered public accountants, review reports of the independent registered public accountants, approve all auditing services and related fees and the terms of any agreements, and to pre-approve any non-audit services to be rendered by the Company's independent registered public accountants.

The AF Committee reviews and provides oversight of the Company's financial strategy, capital structure and liquidity position, including review and oversight of transactions
Table of Contents involving public offerings of the Company's equity and debt securities, transactions involving material debt obligations, dividend policies and practices, liquidity and cash flow position, tax strategy and tax compliance, and investment policies and strategy. The AF Committee also reviews and provides oversight of transactions and expenditures specifically delegated to it by the Board of Directors, performs such other financial oversight responsibilities as the Board of Directors may request, and reviews the security of the Company's information technology systems and operations, including programs and defenses against cyber threats.
In addition, the AF Committee reviews and approves all related-party business transactions in which any of the Company's officers, Directors or nominees for Director have an interest and that may be required to be reported in the Company's periodic reports, and reports to the full Board of Directors on such matters.
COMPENSATION, NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE ("CNG COMMITTEE")
The CNG Committee is a standing Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of the following persons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Ronald J. Vance, Chairman  C. Kevin McArthur  Sybil E. Veenman● The CNG Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2018 and took action by unanimous written consent once.● All members are considered "Outside Directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.● All members are considered a "non-employee Director" as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.● All members are Independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards.● The CNG Committee Charter is available on the Company's web site at www.royalgold.com under "Governance – Committees."
[END TABLE]
Roles and Responsibilities of the Committee The CNG Committee oversees the Company's compensation policies, plans and programs, reviews and determines the compensation to be paid to executive officers, and recommends compensation to be paid to the Company's Directors. The full Board reviews and considers the CNG Committee's director compensation recommendations prior to making final determinations. The CNG Committee also administers and implements the Company's incentive compensation and equity-based plans. The CNG Committee is responsible for overseeing preparation of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and for preparing the report on executive compensation for public disclosure in the Company's Proxy Statement.
The CNG Committee may form subcommittees and delegate to its subcommittees such power and authority as it deems necessary or advisable. The CNG Committee has no current intention to delegate any of its authority with respect to determining executive officer compensation to any subcommittee. The CNG Committee does not delegate its responsibilities with respect to executive compensation to any executive officer of the Company.
In addition to compensation matters, the CNG Committee also identifies or reviews individuals proposed to become members of the Board of Directors and recommends Director nominees. In selecting Director nominees, the CNG Committee assesses the nominee's independence and considers his or her experience and areas of expertise, including experience in the mining industry, diversity, integrity, perspective, broad business judgment and leadership skills, personal qualities and reputation in the business community, and ability and willingness to commit adequate time to Board and Committee matters, all in the context of the perceived needs of the Board of Directors at that time. The Company does not have a stand-alone policy regarding the consideration of diversity in selecting Director nominees. However, the CNG Committee considers a wide range of criteria in nominee selection including diversity, social, technical, political, management, legal, governance, finance and broader business experience as well as other areas of expertise. These matters are considered through discussions at CNG Committee meetings and the executive sessions thereof.
The CNG Committee will consider Director candidates recommended by stockholders using the same criteria outlined above, provided such written recommendations are submitted to the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company in accordance with the advance notice and other provisions of the Company's Bylaws.
Table of Contents
Proposal 1
The CNG Committee also advises the Board of Directors regularly on various corporate governance matters and principles, including regulatory actions impacting the Company. The CNG Committee reviews the content of and compliance with the Company's Board of Directors Governance Guidelines annually, and assesses compliance with corporate governance guidelines and requirements established by the SEC, Nasdaq and applicable laws and regulations.
Meetings and Attendance
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal year 2018"), the Board of Directors held four regular meetings, all of which included executive sessions of the Independent Directors, three special meetings and took action twice by unanimous written consent. Each Director attended, in person or by telephone, 100% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committee on which he or she served. It is the Company's policy that each Director attends each Annual Meeting, and all Directors attended last year's Annual Meeting.
Executive Sessions
The Independent Directors meet regularly in executive sessions. Executive sessions are generally scheduled immediately before or after each regular Board of Directors meeting. The independent Committees also meet regularly in executive sessions, generally scheduled immediately after each regular Committee meeting.
Board Self-Assessments
The Board and Committees conduct annual self-assessments to evaluate the needs, qualifications, experience, skills and balance of the Board and each Committee, and to ensure that the Board and each Committee is working effectively.
Board Orientation and Education
The Company conducts a thorough orientation program with each incoming director to efficiently introduce them to the Company, its management, business model and corporate strategy, financial condition, corporate organization and constituent documents, and its governance policies and practices.
The Company offers reimbursement for attendance at external director education programs. Directors also receive quarterly updates concerning legal, regulatory, accounting, finance, compliance and governance developments and trends, as well as in-depth annual topical presentations on matters of concern to public company directors.
Board Governance Guidelines
Upon recommendation from the CNG Committee, the Board of Directors adopted the Board of Directors' Governance Guidelines to assist the Board of Directors in the discharge of its duties and to serve the interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board of Directors Governance Guidelines are reviewed on a yearly basis and updated when appropriate for evolving best practices and regulatory developments. The Board of Directors Governance Guidelines are available on the Company's website at www.royalgold.com under "Governance – Guidelines & Policies."
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
The Company has long had in place a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") applicable to all of its Directors, officers and employees, including the President and CEO, the CFO and Vice President Strategy, and other persons performing financial reporting functions. The Code is reviewed on a yearly basis by the CNG Committee and Board and is updated when appropriate. The Code is available on the Company's website at www.royalgold.com under "Governance – Guidelines & Policies." The Code is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote (a) honest and ethical conduct; (b) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures; (c) compliance with laws, rules and regulations; (d) prompt internal reporting of Code violations; and (e) accountability for adherence to the Code. The Company will post on its website any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The AF Committee's charter requires it to approve or ratify certain transactions involving the Company and "related persons," as defined under the relevant SEC rules. Any transaction with a related person, other than transactions available to all employees generally or involving aggregate amounts of less than $120,000, must be approved or ratified by the AF Committee. The policy applies to all executive officers, Directors and their family members and entities in
Table of Contents
Proposal 1
which any of these individuals has a substantial ownership interest or control. In determining whether to approve, ratify, or disapprove of entry into a transaction, the AF Committee will consider all relevant facts and circumstances and will take into account, among other factors, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances; whether the transaction would impair the independence of an Independent Director; and whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any Director or executive officer of Royal Gold. No related party transactions were required to be reported for fiscal year 2018.
Anti-Hedging, Anti-Pledging and Short Sale Policies
The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits Directors, executive officers and employees on the Company's restricted trading list from trading in the Company's common stock on a short term basis, purchasing the Company's common stock on margin, short sales of Company stock, buying or selling put or call options or other derivative securities relating to Company stock, engaging in hedging or monetization transactions, such as collars, equity swaps, prepaid variable forwards and exchange funds with respect to the Company's common stock, pledging Company stock as security for any obligation, participating in investment clubs that invest in the Company's securities, holding the Company's securities in a margin account, and, other than pursuant to a qualified trading plan, placing open orders (i) of longer than three business days or (ii) ending after a trading window closes. The Insider Trading Policy is reviewed on a yearly basis by the CNG Committee and the Board and is updated when appropriate.
Trading Controls
Directors, executive officers and employees on the Company's restricted trading list are required to receive the permission of the Company's Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary prior to entering into any transactions in Company securities, including gifts, grants and transactions involving derivatives. Generally, trading is permitted only during open trading periods. Directors, ex-executive officers and employees on the Company's restricted trading list may enter into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading period and must be approved by the Company.
Conditional Resignation Policies
Under the Company's Bylaws, each Director is required to execute a "conditional resignation" providing that such resignation shall be effective in the event (i) the Director fails to be elected at any annual meeting of the stockholders at which he or she stands for election or re-election, and (ii) the Board notifies the Director or publicly announces that it accepted the resignation. A majority of the disinterested Directors has discretion whether to accept or reject the Director's resignation.
Under the Company's Board of Directors' Governance Guidelines, any director reaching the age of 72 must submit a written offer of resignation. A majority of the disinterested Directors has discretion to accept or reject such offers of resignation, which will be considered annually for so long as the affected Director remains in office. During fiscal year 2018, the offer of resignation previously submitted by Mr. Hayes was reviewed but was not accepted by the disinterested Directors.
Royal Gold's compensation for non-employee Directors is designed to reflect current market trends and developments with respect to compensation of board members, including the award of a higher proportion of total compensation in equity than in cash.
The CNG Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending to the independent members of the Board of Directors the compensation paid to non-employee Directors. The independent members of the Board of Directors consider the CNG Committee recommendation and make final determinations of non-employee Director compensation.
The Company does not have a retirement plan for non-employee Directors. Executive officers who are also Directors are not paid additional compensation for their services on the Board of Directors. Therefore, Mr. Jensen, as President and CEO, does not receive any compensation for his services as a Director.
Peer Group Benchmarking
The CNG Committee retains an independent compensation consultant biennially to benchmark Director compensation against the Company-selected peer group, which is the same group of companies the CNG Committee uses to benchmark executive compensation (see page 46 for
Table of Contents
Proposal 1
a list of these companies). When considering Director compensation for fiscal year 2018, the CNG Committee reviewed and considered the results of a benchmark study conducted by Hugessen Consulting Inc. ("Hugessen") dated May 2016.
In addition to benchmarking the amount of Director compensation against the Company's peer group using several methodologies, the 2016 study also compared the forms of compensation paid to the Company's Directors to the forms of compensation paid to peer group directors, as well as the share ownership guidelines applicable to directors of the Company and its peer group.
Components of Director 2018 Compensation Program
Based upon its work with Hugessen, the CNG Committee recommended and the Independent Directors approved, for the third consecutive year, that no changes be made to total Director compensation or to the forms or proportions of compensation for fiscal year 2018. In order to maintain a similar proportion of cash and restricted stock or restricted stock unit value compared to that awarded for fiscal year 2017, while holding cash compensation constant for fiscal year 2018, the resulting number of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units to be awarded to each non-employee director for fiscal year 2018 was determined to be 2,030 shares. The value of such shares was determined using a thirty-day volume weighted average price for the period ending July 31, 2017.
2018 Director Compensation
The following table provides information regarding compensation earned by the Company's non-employee Directors for their services during fiscal year 2018. Amounts shown for each Director vary due to service on Committees or as Committee chairs. The annual retainers for fiscal year 2018 were paid in cash on a quarterly basis.

Proposal 1
DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANThe Company offers a Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP") to its Independent Directors. The DCP is a voluntary program that allows participants to set aside eligible cash and equity compensation in a tax-deferred vehicle for retirement or other life event purposes. This DCP allows the participant to elect to receive certain income in a future year that would otherwise be paid in the upcoming year. This means that these amounts are not subject to federal income tax at the time of contribution to the plan. The DCP is intended to promote retention by providing a long-term savings opportunity on a tax-efficient basis. Five of the six Independent Directors elected to defer one-hundred percent (100%) of their fiscal year 2018 equity compensation.
ExpensesNon-employee Directors are reimbursed for all of their out-of-pocket travel, lodging and meal expenses incurred in connection with their travel in service to the Board. Reimbursements do not include compensation for the value of our Directors' time spent traveling on Board business.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
All non-employee Directors are expected to have a significant long-term financial interest in the Company. To encourage alignment with the interests of stockholders, each non-employee Director is expected to own shares of Royal Gold common stock equal in value to ten (10) times the annual cash retainer, excluding meeting fees or retainers awarded to the Chairmen of the Board or any Committee, within five years from the date of their respective first restricted stock grant. As of September 17, 2018, all of the Directors exceed their ownership guidelines except Ms. Veenman who joined the Board in January 2017. All non-employee Directors are required to hold 50% of the shares of common stock acquired pursuant to any equity grant, net of any shares sold to cover withholding taxes, until they meet their ownership target.

 PROPOSAL    
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we seek stockholder approval of an advisory resolution on the compensation of our NEOs as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative discussion included in this Proxy Statement.
This proposal, commonly known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to approve, reject or abstain from voting with respect to our fiscal year 2018 executive compensation programs and policies and the compensation paid to the NEOs. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement.
The Board recommends a "FOR" vote because it believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving the Company's compensation goals of paying a competitive salary, providing attractive annual and long-term incentives to reward growth and linking management interests with stockholder interests.
Key characteristics of our fiscal year 2018 executive officer compensation program are described beginning on page 39.
Stockholders are asked to approve the following advisory resolution:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved.
Although the vote on this proposal is advisory only, the CNG Committee will review and consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is required to approve this proposal.
The Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with management the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, and the Board of Directors has approved that recommendation.
This report is provided by the following Independent Directors, who comprise the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee:

We Delivered Record Financial and Operating Results for Fiscal Year 2018
Despite rising interest rates, global trade conflicts, tense periods of political instability, changes to the U.S. tax code, concerns about the future direction of U.S. equities, and relatively flat average gold prices, we delivered solid, steady performance and achieved record revenue, operating cash flow, dividends and production volume for the second consecutive year. We delivered a total stockholder return of 20.2% for fiscal year 2018, placing the Company in the 80th percentile for one-year TSR among the constituents of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF ("GDX Constituents").
We took advantage of a relatively quiet time in business development to repay the remaining $250 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility, leaving the full $1 billion in borrowing capacity available for portfolio growth at June 30, 2018.

We use the Same Key Metrics to Evaluate Corporate Performance that we use in our Compensation Programs
Our executives bear responsibility for driving Company performance, and their compensation is strongly correlated to the Company's performance based on the same key metrics that our Board of Directors utilizes to chart corporate strategy and evaluate our success in achieving that strategy. These key metrics are summarized in the table below. Their correlation to executive compensation is presented in much more detail, along with other compensation disclosures, in the executive compensation discussion following this Executive Summary.
Stockholder Engagement Resulted in Executive Compensation Transformation
In August 2015, the CNG Committee introduced significant changes to the executive compensation program approved for fiscal year 2016. These changes are summarized in the following table. We believe these changes in conjunction with stockholder engagement efforts were key to receiving approximately 97% voter support for our executive compensation program at our annual meeting of stockholders in November 2016 and 2017.

Our Compensation Philosophy and Objectives Support Company Performance
The CNG Committee sets and administers executive compensation philosophy, objectives and design. Our fundamental compensation philosophy is to recruit, retain and reward high-performing executive officers who will:
When designing executive compensation, the CNG Committee seeks to achieve the following objectives:
Our Executive Compensation Design Includes a Mix of Base Salary and Short- and Long-Term Incentives
The Company's total direct executive compensation program includes base salary, a short-term cash incentive and long-term equity incentives. The majority of target compensation (80% of CEO pay and 68% of NEO pay) is offered in variable pay, with an emphasis on long-term equity, to best align our executives' interests with our stockholders' interests:

We Established Threshold, Target and Maximum Payouts for Short-Term Incentives and Long-Term Performance Shares Correlated to Key Company Performance Metrics
The CNG Committee established threshold, target and maximum payouts for short-term incentives and for the GEO Share and TSR Share performance measures, which range from zero payout if no threshold performance measure is achieved, to 200% payout if each maximum performance measure is achieved or exceeded.
The CNG Committee believes that
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Maximum level performance should be set to require a significant stretch to achieve; they are exemplary performance levels that exceed near term targets and are worthy of payout up to a maximum 200% of target. 
[END TABLE]
We Established a Hurdle for Fiscal Year 2018 Incentive Awards
The CNG Committee required the Company to achieve a $240 million Net Revenue Target for fiscal year 2018 in order for the Company's executive officers to be eligible to vest in restricted stock awarded in August 2017. For this purpose, "Net Revenue" means our reported revenue, less reported cost of sales, and less any revenue recognized from our Voisey's Bay royalty.
The Committee determined to exclude revenue recognized from our Voisey's Bay royalty (historically a significant revenue contributor) from "Net Revenue" because the operator of the Voisey's Bay mine unilaterally changed the royalty calculation methodology in a manner that eliminated royalty revenue—a methodology the Company aggressively disputed until the litigation was successfully resolved in September 2018.
The Net Revenue Target applicable to restricted stock awards made in August 2017 was surpassed in fiscal year 2018, with Net Revenue of $375 million. As a result, the Company's executive officers became eligible to vest in the restricted stock awarded in August 2017.
Base Salary
Base salary is the fixed cash amount paid to our executive officers each fiscal year. Base salaries are benchmarked in alternating years by the CNG Committee's independent compensation consultant and are reviewed and approved by the CNG Committee annually to align or maintain salaries at or near the mean of our compensation peers. In years when independent benchmarking is not performed, the CNG Committee ages the most recent benchmarking results using a U.S. Department of Labor cost-of-living index for the geographic region that includes the Company's Denver, Colorado headquarter office.
The CNG Committee engaged Hugessen during fiscal year 2017 to benchmark our executive compensation against our compensation peers. After considering Hugessen's 2017 benchmarking study, the CNG Committee adjusted prior year base salaries to include a 3.1% cost of living increase and, where appropriate, a further adjustment aligning each executive officer's fiscal year 2018 base salary with those of the same or similar officer positions at our peer companies:

Short-Term Incentive Awards
WE CONTINUED UTILIZING A SHORT-TERM  INCENTIVE SCORECARD The CNG Committee utilizes a formulaic scorecard including pre-determined Financial, Operational and Strategic Performance Measures, as well as Individual Performance Measures, for determining awards of short-term incentives. The CNG Committee believes the scorecard greatly enhances transparency, utilizes more commonly-used and easily-understood financial and operational measures than the prior methodology, and better aligns NEO pay with the Company's fiscal year performance. The scorecard was well-received by our stockholders and the proxy advisors, and continued in use for fiscal year 2018.
Forty percent of our NEOs' short-term incentive eligibility depended on the Company's performance against three financial and operational metrics:
Our operating cash flow ("OCF") multiple relative to those of the GDX Constituents before working capital changes. The operating cash flow multiple measures our relative market performance against that of our peers and directly reflects production performance, financial discipline and portfolio quality;
Net GEO production relative to the Company's fiscal year 2018 budget forecast. Net GEO production relative to budget represents the production success of our existing asset portfolio. Net GEO production for purposes of determining short-term incentives is the result of our operators' aggregate mineral production subject to our stream and royalty interests, net of Voisey's Bay production, multiplied by metal prices used in our fiscal year 2018 budget, less reported cost of sales, divided by the gold price used in our fiscal year 2018 budget; and
Our ability to hold costs in line with our budget. The cost containment metric measures our ability to conduct the Company's business in a cost-efficient manner.
Forty percent of our NEOs' short-term incentive eligibility depended on the degree to which the Company achieved four strategic objectives: acquiring new streaming and royalty assets; identifying a new deposit, drilling and increasing mineralized material at the Company's Peak Gold joint venture in Alaska; preparing the Voisey's Bay litigation for trial in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019; and maintaining specific leverage and liquidity levels.
Twenty percent of our NEOs' short-term incentive eligibility depended on each NEO's performance against multiple unique corporate and personal goals designed to promote each NEO's superior individual performance and continued development and growth as an executive officer, as well as to promote management talent development below the officer level.
The CNG Committee established threshold, target and maximum payouts ranging from zero payout if no threshold measure is achieved, to 100% payout of target if each target measure is achieved, to 200% payout of target if all maximum measures are achieved or exceeded. The CNG Committee defined "target" as the mid-point of each NEO's short-term incentive range (75% to 125% of base salary for the CEO, and 60% to 90% of base salary for all other NEOs).
Table 6 summarizes the fiscal year 2018 short-term incentive measures and the payout thresholds associated with them.

Proposal 2
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES WERE AWARDED FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The CNG Committee, with assistance from management, utilized the scorecard to determine short-term incentive awards for fiscal year 2018 Company and individual performance, as follows:
The CNG Committee determined the Company's performance against each Financial, Operational and Strategic Performance Measure. The CEO determined each executive officer's (other than the CEO's) performance against their unique Individual Performance Measures, and the CNG Committee determined the CEO's performance against his Individual Performance Measures.
The scores for all measures were converted to a percentage of the target achieved and multiplied by the percent weight assigned to each measure. The results were totaled.
The total score was divided by 100 and multiplied by the midpoint of each NEO's short-term incentive range, as described above. As indicated in Table 8, the NEOs as a group were awarded short-term incentives at or slightly below target.
Long-Term Incentive Awards
Long-term incentive compensation is designed to encourage executive officers to manage the Company's business over a multi-year period by delivering a significant portion of each officer's potential total direct compensation at a future date.
Table of Contents
Proposal 2
WE UTILIZE THREE FORMS OF EQUITY AWARDS, EACH SERVING A DIFFERENT PURPOSE
Stock Options and Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights Stock options and Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") are considered long-term awards and are intended to promote sustainable business results by encouraging management to achieve share price appreciation. A SAR is a right to receive, upon exercise, the excess of the fair market value of one share of stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR. SARs are settled in shares of the Company's common stock. The grant price for options and SARs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. Options and SARs have ten-year terms, and vest in equal annual increments over three years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. Once granted, options and SARs are not subject to any future price adjustment.
We typically award the first $100,000 in value of stock options in the form of incentive stock options (the limit for incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code) and amounts above $100,000 are typically awarded in the form of SARs.
Restricted Stock Awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") focus on retention by securing the long-term commitment of our executives. Restricted stock and RSUs vest in equal annual increments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Shares of restricted stock awarded to our U.S.-based executives are considered issued and outstanding with respect to which executives may vote and receive dividends paid in the ordinary course to other Royal Gold stockholders. RSUs awarded to our Canada-based employees do not entitle the executives to vote or receive dividends, although executives receive a cash payment (or dividend equivalent) in the amount of declared dividends at the time dividends are paid.
In addition to service-based vesting requirements for historical restricted stock awards, the CNG Committee introduced a performance-based vesting requirement beginning with restricted stock awards made to NEOs in August 2012 for fiscal year 2013. For restricted stock awarded before August 2015, all stock underlying an annual award would have been forfeited if the Company failed to meet an Adjusted EBITDA hurdle established for the fiscal year for which the award was made. For awards made since August 2015, the CNG Committee requires the Company to achieve the Net Revenue Target before the NEOs become entitled to receive such awards. The CNG Committee reasons that there may be times when the health of the Company does not allow for restricted stock awards or RSUs, and these hurdles establish a threshold below which corporate performance is not sufficient to justify vesting the awards.
For restricted stock awards made for fiscal year 2018, the Net Revenue Target was $240 million. The Company achieved actual Net Revenue of $375 million in fiscal year 2018, making the NEOs eligible to vest in these shares if the service requirement is also met.
Performance Stock Performance stock awards are intended to provide significant incentive to achieve long-term revenue growth and share price appreciation. Performance shares can be earned only if performance goals are met within defined measuring periods. If the performance goals are not achieved by the end of the applicable period, the shares are forfeited. Performance shares are not considered issued and outstanding shares with respect to which executives may vote or receive dividends and cannot vest until the CNG Committee determines that performance objectives are met. Performance shares are settled with shares of the Company's common stock when they vest.
Performance Shares Awarded Before August  2015 Performance shares awarded prior to August 2015 which have not already vested or lapsed may vest upon meeting a single performance goal: 10% compounded annual growth in Adjusted Free Cash Flow Per Share ("AFCFPS")* on a trailing twelve-month basis. These performance shares may vest in increments over five years from the grant date. For example, a threshold level of 2.5% growth in compounded AFCFPS is necessary for the minimum vesting of 25% of the performance shares. Maximum vesting is earned with achievement of 10% compounded AFCFPS.
Table of Contents
Proposal 2
Table 9 shows the amount of performance shares awarded for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 which have vested through July 30, 2018. All performance shares awarded for fiscal year 2014 which did not vest on or prior to June 30, 2018, have lapsed and cannot vest. All performance shares awarded for fiscal year 2015 have vested.
Performance Shares Awarded Beginning in August  2015 The CNG Committee replaced the AFCFPS measure with two new performance share measures for performance shares awarded beginning in August 2015 for fiscal year 2016:
GEO Shares and TSR Shares may vest by linear interpolation in a range between zero shares if neither threshold GEO and TSR metric is met; to 100% of GEO Shares and TSR Shares awarded if both the target GEO and TSR metrics are met; to 200% of the GEO Shares and TSR Shares awarded if both the maximum GEO and TSR metrics are met or exceeded.
The specific goals for awarding performance shares for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, and the Company's results compared to these goals, were:
GEO Shares Goal: Add, within five fiscal years after any grant date, a specific number of Net GEOs over the actual Net GEO production achieved in the fiscal year prior to the grant date, excluding Net GEOs attributable to Voisey's Bay. The CNG Committee established specific threshold, target and maximum Net GEO growth goals for fiscal year 2018. The specific goals are not disclosed here because the CNG Committee determined that public disclosure of them could cause competitive harm to the Company and does not believe that the figures themselves are material to an understanding of the GEO Shares.
Growth in actual Net GEO production volume achieved during each of fiscal years 2016 and 2017 exceeded the number of additional Net GEOs required to vest GEO Shares at the target level for each award. Actual Net GEO production volume achieved during fiscal year 2018 was sufficient to vest an incremental number of GEO Shares awarded for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 but was insufficient to vest any GEO Shares awarded for fiscal year 2018. Accordingly, the CNG Committee awarded GEO Shares to the NEOs based on linear interpolation between the target and maximum number of shares eligible for award. Vesting of GEO Shares awarded for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 is summarized as follows:
Table of Contents
Proposal 2
TSR Shares Goal: Achieve the highest percentile in TSR among the GDX Constituents for defined 1- and 3-year periods. With respect to TSR Shares awarded for a fiscal year:
Awards of Three-year TSR Shares and One-year TSR Shares that are determined to vest will be settled following June 30 of the third fiscal year after the grant date, when the CNG Committee determines that the TSR goal has been met or exceeded. In order to receive any TSR Shares, executives must remain in continuous service to the Company through the third anniversary of the grant date. Eligibility to vest TSR Shares will lapse as to any that do not vest at the end of their three-year or one-year measuring period.
Table 12 summarizes the TSR Shares awarded for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, the Company's TSR percentile compared to the GDX Constituents for each of these fiscal years, and the determinations of the CNG Committee with respect to such awards.

Proposal 2
The CNG Committee Leads the Annual Executive Compensation-Setting Process, with Involvement from its Compensation Consultant and Management
The CNG Committee commissions external reviews of executive and director compensation in alternating years to balance consulting costs with the need to achieve consistency with market compensation practices. The CNG Committee first retained Hugessen in fiscal year 2015 to provide independent advice on the Company's executive compensation framework and design, as well as related governance matters. Since then, the CNG Committee included Hugessen's director and executive compensation reports as one consideration in its deliberations on compensation design and award.
The CNG Committee utilizes the independence factors prescribed by the SEC and Nasdaq to assess the independence of its compensation consultants on an annual basis. Each year, the CNG Committee determined that, at all relevant times, no conflict of interest exists regarding Hugessen's work.
The CNG Committee's compensation consultant provides no services to management. Instead, the CNG Committee determines the nature and scope of the desired consulting services and enters into a consulting agreement directly with the independent consultant. The CNG Committee Chairman approves all statements for services performed.
Members of Royal Gold's management do not have authority to make off-cycle or ad-hoc equity grants. In the event of a new hire grant, approval is obtained prior to any grant being made either at a regularly scheduled CNG Committee meeting or by unanimous written consent of the CNG Committee.

We Establish Relevant Comparator Groups and Conduct Executive Compensation Benchmarking
Many of our largest investors have told us repeatedly in recent years that they consider our gold-focused peer group to be the most relevant and appropriate for compensation and performance benchmarking purposes. Following is a comparison between the Company's 2017 selected peer group and those selected by Glass-Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") in 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  The Company peer group is reviewed annually. Since 2013, changes to the peer group were made either to account for merger and acquisition activity in the peer group or to better position the Company among its peers according to size, as measured by market capitalization. 
2  According to S&P CapitalIQ, (i) there are only four publicly traded precious metals companies (including Royal Gold) incorporated in the United States having a market capitalization greater than $1 billion, compared to 22 such companies in Canada; and (ii) as of June 30, 2018, the peers selected most recently by ISS averaged only one-sixth the market capitalization of Royal Gold. We believe that a fair compensation peer group, in terms of both industry profile and size, cannot be selected for Royal Gold without including Canadian entities. 
[END TABLE]

Proposal 2
Employment Agreements
Royal Gold entered into employment agreements with each of its NEOs effective July 1, 2016, superseding and replacing employment agreements entered into in September 2013. Each of the employment agreements were amended effective December 15, 2017. Pursuant to Mr. Jensen's employment agreement, Mr. Jensen will continue to serve as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Company's Board of Directors will continue to nominate Mr. Jensen for re-election as Director. Pursuant to individual employment agreements, Messrs. Heissenbuttel, Isto and Kirchhoff will continue to serve as officers of the Company, namely the Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Strategy, Vice President Operations, and Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, respectively. Mr. Wenger, formerly Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, separated from service to the Company effective June 8, 2018. The employment agreements are for one-year terms, renew automatically for four consecutive one-year periods, and will expire on June 30, 2021, unless either the Company or the executive timely elects not to renew the term of the employment agreement, or unless the employment agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms. As described below under the heading Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control (page 54), each employment agreement provides for severance compensation in certain events. None of the employment agreements provides for excise tax gross-ups for change-in-control provisions.
Benefit Programs
Benefit programs for the executive officers are common in design and purpose to those for all of our employees in the United States and Canada and include an opportunity to participate in various health and welfare benefit programs. We share the cost of certain health benefit programs with our employees. The Company also maintains retirement plans for our US and Canadian Employees. The US plan is a Salary Reduction/Simplified Employee Pension Plan ("SARSEP Plan"), in which all US employees are eligible to participate. The Canadian plan is a Group Registered Retirement Savings Plan ("Group RRSP"), in which all Canadian employees are eligible to participate. The SARSEP Plan and Group RRSP are voluntary plans.
The SARSEP Plan and Group RRSP allow employees to reduce their pre-tax salary, subject to certain regulatory limitations, and to put this money into a tax deferred investment plan. The Company may make non-elective contributions, up to 7% of an individual's annual salary and short-term incentive, subject to limits. Those that do not participate in the SARSEP Plan and Group RRSP receive a 3% employer contribution in accordance with the respective plan rules. Employer contributions are immediately 100% vested. Total employee and employer contributions to the SARSEP Plan and Group RRSP are subject to annual regulatory limitations.

Proposal 2
Perquisites
The Company generally does not provide perquisites or other special benefits to executive officers.
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
Royal Gold's stock ownership requirements encourage its NEOs to achieve and maintain a minimum investment in the Company's common stock at levels set by the CNG Committee. The requirement incentivizes our NEOs to focus on improving long-term stockholder value and aligns the interests of management and stockholders. The requirement is set as a number of shares that is equivalent to a multiple of the NEO's base salary. Unexercised stock options and SARs, unvested shares of restricted stock and unearned performance shares are not considered owned for purposes of the program.
There is no timeframe in which the NEOs must meet ownership targets. The program also requires each NEO to hold an aggregate of fifty percent (50%) of the shares of stock acquired pursuant to any grant of options, SARs, restricted stock or performance stock, net of any shares sold to cover withholding taxes, until such executive officer reaches his or her ownership target. All NEOs are in compliance with the ownership requirements (see Table 15 below, calculated as of September 17, 2018).
In order to align the interests of management and stockholders, Royal Gold's policy precludes NEOs from hedging against their investments in the Company's common stock. Further, NEOs are restricted from pledging their investments in the Company's common stock.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
Prior to passage and signing of the Tax Reform and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act"), Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposed a limit on the amount that a public company may deduct for compensation paid in any one year to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and certain other NEOs. The limitation did not apply to compensation meeting the requirements under Section 162(m) for "qualifying performance based" compensation. Prior to the Act becoming law, the Company and the CNG Committee reviewed and considered the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m). The CNG Committee usually sought, and with respect to executive compensation determinations made for fiscal year 2018 did seek, to satisfy the requirements necessary to allow the compensation of its named executive officers to be deductible under Section 162(m).
Post-Termination Compensation
The Company does not provide pension or other retirement benefits apart from the SARSEP Plan and Group RRSP Plan described above. The Company provides certain post-termination benefits pursuant to the terms of the LTIP and the employment agreements described above under "Employment Agreements" on page 47 and below under the section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" on page 54. None of the employment agreements provide for excise tax gross-ups for change-in-control provisions.

Proposal 2
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to support its ability to recruit, retain and reward high-performing executive officers who will drive growth, profitability and increased long-term stockholder value, while managing the Company responsibly over both the long- and short-term, and while maintaining the Company's excellent reputation. The CNG Committee believes that the Company's executive compensation is an appropriate balance of competitive salary and attractive short- and long-term incentives that: (a) are based upon achievement of many of the same measures used by the Board of Directors to chart our corporate strategy and evaluate the Company's success in achieving that strategy; (b) utilize multiple performance measures to avoid placing excessive emphasis on any single measure; and (c) provide opportunity to earn significantly higher-than-target compensation over the long term through consistent superior corporate and individual performance. Management and the CNG Committee believe the total executive compensation program provides strong incentives to manage for the long term while avoiding excessive risk-taking in the short term.

Interim amounts may vest in 25% increments upon achievement of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the target objectives. Each performance stock award, if earned, will be settled with shares of Royal Gold common stock. Performance targets for awards made prior to fiscal 2012 are based on growth of free cash flow per share on a trailing twelve month basis and growth of royalty ounces in reserve per share on an annual basis. Performance targets for awards made beginning in fiscal 2012 are based on growth of adjusted free cash flow per share on a trailing twelve month basis.

Calculations for this table assume that the triggering event took place on June 30, 2018, the last business day of our 2018 fiscal year, except as noted. Calculations for combined amounts shown for awards under the Company's 2004 LTIP and 2015 LTIP are based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 29, 2018, which was $92.84.

Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we provide the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and CEO, Mr. Jensen, to the annual total compensation of our median compensation employee. For fiscal year 2018:
We identified our median compensation employee by examining total cash compensation (salary and short-term cash incentive) paid for fiscal year 2018 to all individuals, excluding Mr. Jensen, who were employed by us on June 30, 2018, the last day of our fiscal year. We examined all of our U.S., Canadian and Swiss employees, other than Mr. Jensen. No assumptions, adjustments or estimates were made in respect of total cash compensation, except that we (a) annualized the compensation of any employee that was not employed with us for all of fiscal year 2018, and (b) applied the average fiscal year 2018 foreign exchange rate to Canadian Dollars and Swiss Francs paid to our Canadian and Swiss employees, respectively. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because all of our employees receive a salary and are eligible for short-term cash incentives, while fewer than all employees are eligible for annual equity awards.
After identifying the median compensation employee, we determined the annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology employed for Mr. Jensen and our NEOs, as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
We believe the above pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The AF Committee adopted a policy that requires advance approval for all audit, audit-related, tax services, and other services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The policy provides for pre-approval by the AF Committee of specifically defined audit and non-audit services. Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year, the Audit and Finance Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent auditor is engaged to perform such service. The AF Committee delegated to the Chairman of the AF Committee authority to approve certain permitted services, provided that the Chairman reports any such decisions to the AF Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The AF Committee pre-approved all of the services described above for the Company's 2018 fiscal year.
The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and the Company's reporting processes, including internal control over financial reporting, with the Company's management. The Audit and Finance Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accountants for fiscal year 2018, the matters required to be discussed by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards. The Audit and Finance Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding its communications with the Company's Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence and the Audit and Finance Committee has discussed the independence of Ernst & Young LLP with the Company.
Based on the review and discussions with the Company's auditors and our management, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, for filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

STOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and Directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership in the Company's equity securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, Directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely on its review of copies of such reports received and written representations from such persons that no other reports were required for those persons, the Company believes that all filing requirements applicable to its officers, Directors and greater than 10% stockholders were timely met for fiscal year 2018 except for (i) a Form 4 filing for Mr. Jensen relating to exercise of stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights that was due on August 18, 2017 that was filed on August 25, 2017, and (ii) a Form 4 filing for Mr. Wenger relating to a sale pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan that was due on July 14, 2017 that was filed on July 17, 2017.

November 14, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. MST. Stockholders of record holding shares of the Company's common stock at the close of business on September 17, 2018 (the "Record Date") are eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting and at all postponements and adjournments thereof. There were 65,510,707 shares outstanding on the Record Date.
We utilize the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rules allowing us to furnish proxy materials through a "notice and access" model via the Internet. On or about October 1, 2018, we will furnish a Notice of Internet Availability to our stockholders of record containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials and to vote. In addition, instructions on how to request a printed copy of these materials may be found in the Notice. For more information on voting your stock, please see "Voting Your Shares" below.
Each share of Royal Gold common stock that you own entitles you to one vote. If you are a stockholder of record, your proxy card shows the number of shares of Royal Gold common stock that you own. If your stock is held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee (a "Nominee"), the Nominee holding your stock will send you a voting instruction form. You may elect to vote in one of three methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● By Phone or Internet - You may vote your shares by following the instructions on your notice card, proxy card or voting instruction form. If you vote by telephone or via the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. 
● By Mail - If this proxy statement was mailed to you, or if you requested that a proxy statement be mailed to you, you may vote your shares by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form. If you vote by proxy card, your "proxy" (each or any of the individuals named on the proxy card) will vote your shares as you instruct on the proxy card. If you vote by voting instruction form, the Nominee holding your stock will vote your shares as you instruct on the voting instruction form. If you sign and return the proxy card, but do not give instructions on how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors: (1) "FOR" the election of Directors as described herein under "Proposal 1 - Election of Directors;" (2) "FOR" a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers described herein under "Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote on Compensation of Named Executive Officers;" and (3) "FOR" ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accountants described herein under "Proposal 3 - Ratification of Appointment of the Independent Auditors for 2019." 
● In Person - You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. A ballot will be provided if you wish. If your stock is held in the name of a Nominee, you must present a proxy from that Nominee in order to verify that the Nominee has not voted your shares on your behalf. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a holder of common stock, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. This can be done by submitting another properly completed proxy card with a later date, sending a written notice of revocation to the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. You should be aware that simply attending the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your previously submitted proxy; rather you must notify a Company representative at the Annual Meeting of your desire to revoke your proxy and vote in person. Written notice revoking a proxy should be sent to the Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Royal Gold, Inc., 1660 Wynkoop Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado 80202.
A majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum at a meeting of the stockholders. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be counted as being present in person for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a Nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote those shares on a proposal because the Nominee does not have discretionary voting authority and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner with respect to that proposal.
