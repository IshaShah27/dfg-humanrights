PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD DECEMBER 7, 2018
The board of directors of Paylocity Holding Corporation is soliciting your proxy for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on December 7, 2018, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This Proxy Statement and related materials are first being made available to stockholders on or about October 23, 2018. References in this Proxy Statement to the "Company," "we," "our," "us" and "Paylocity" are to Paylocity Holding Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to the "annual meeting" are to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. When we refer to the Company's fiscal year, we mean the annual period ended on June 30, 2018. This proxy statement covers our 2018 fiscal year, which was from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018").
SOLICITATION AND VOTING
Record Date
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2018 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and any adjournment thereof. At the close of business on this record date, a total of 52,797,354 shares of our common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock has one vote.
Quorum
A majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date must be represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker or bank) or if you vote in person at the meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (shares held by a broker or nominee that does not have the authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Vote Required to Adopt Proposals
Each share of our common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the two director nominees. Each share of our common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote on each other matter. For the election of the directors, the nominees to serve as Class II directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election. You may vote "For" or "Withhold" with respect to the director
Table of Contents
SOLICITATION AND VOTING
nominees. Votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely from the vote with respect to the nominee from which they are withheld and will have no effect on the election of the directors. With respect to the other proposals, approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. Because the vote on compensation of named executive officers is advisory, it will not be binding upon our board of directors.
Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
Broker non-votes, if any, and shares voted "Withhold" will have no effect on the election of the directors. For each of the other proposals, broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted in determining the number of votes cast and will have no effect on the approval of these proposals, but abstentions will have the same effect as negative votes. Proposal No. 2 is a routine matter and no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 2. If your shares are held in an account at a bank or brokerage firm, that bank or brokerage firm may vote your shares of common stock on Proposal No. 2 regarding ratification of our independent auditors, but will not be permitted to vote your shares of common stock with respect to Proposal Nos. 1 and 3, unless you provide instructions as to how your shares should be voted. If an executed proxy card is returned by a bank or broker holding shares, which indicates that the bank or broker has not received voting instructions and does not have discretionary authority to vote on the proposals, the shares will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the proposals. Your bank or broker will vote your shares on Proposal Nos. 1 and 3 only if you provide instructions on how to vote by following the instructions they provide to you. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote promptly, even if you plan to attend the annual meeting. In tabulating the voting results for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal.
Voting Instructions
If you complete and submit your proxy card or voting instructions, the persons named as proxies will follow your voting instructions. If no choice is indicated on a signed and dated proxy card, the shares will be voted as the board recommends on each proposal as follows: "FOR" the election of each of the nominees named herein and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditors. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process for their beneficial owners to provide instructions via telephone or the Internet. The voting instruction form that you receive from your bank or broker will contain instructions for voting.
Depending on how you hold your shares, you may vote in one of the following ways:
Stockholders of Record: You may vote by either marking, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card or via the instructions included in your Notice or using telephone or Internet voting. You may also vote in person at the annual meeting.
Beneficial Stockholders: Your bank, broker or other holder of record will provide you with a voting instruction form for you to use to instruct them on how to vote your shares. Check the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other holder of record to see which voting options are available to you. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request and obtain a valid, "legal" proxy from your bank, broker or other agent.
Votes submitted by telephone or via the Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 6, 2018. Submitting your proxy by mail or telephone or via the Internet will not affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the annual meeting in person.
Table of Contents
SOLICITATION AND VOTING
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close by returning a later-dated proxy card, by voting again by Internet or telephone as more fully detailed in your Notice or proxy card or by delivering written instructions to the Corporate Secretary before the annual meeting. Attendance at the annual meeting will not in and of itself cause your previously voted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request or vote again at the annual meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm or other agent, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other agent, or, if you have obtained a "legal" proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other agent giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.
Solicitation of Proxies
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting stockholders by mail, we will request banks, brokers and other intermediaries holding shares of our common stock beneficially owned by others to obtain proxies from the beneficial owners and will reimburse them for their reasonable, out-of-pocket costs for forwarding proxy and solicitation material to the beneficial owners of common stock. We may use the services of our officers, directors and employees to solicit proxies, personally or by telephone, without additional compensation.
Voting Results
We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting. We will report final results in a Form 8-K report filed with the SEC.
Table of Contents
PROPOSAL NO. 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
We have a classified board of directors consisting of three Class I directors, two Class II directors and two Class III directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors are elected for a term of three years to succeed those directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting date.
The term of the Class II directors, Virginia G. Breen and Ronald V. Waters III, will expire on the date of the 2019 annual meeting. Accordingly, two persons are to be elected to serve as Class II directors of the board of directors at the meeting. The board's nominees for election by the stockholders to those two positions are the two current Class II members of the board of directors: Virginia G. Breen and Ronald V. Waters III. If elected, the nominees will serve as directors until our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal. If any of the nominees declines to serve or becomes unavailable for any reason, or if a vacancy occurs before the election (although we know of no reason to anticipate that this will occur), the proxies may be voted for such substitute nominees as we may designate. The proxies cannot vote for more than two persons.
The two nominees for Class II director receiving the highest number of votes of shares of common stock will be elected as Class II directors. A "Withhold" vote will have no effect on the vote.
We believe that each of our directors has demonstrated business acumen, ethical integrity and an ability to exercise sound judgment as well as a commitment of service to us and our board of directors.
The names of our directors who will continue in office until the 2020 and 2021 annual meetings of stockholders, as well as the nominees for Class II directors to be elected at this meeting, and certain information about them as of October 23, 2018 is set forth below. Also set forth below are the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led our nominating and corporate governance committee to conclude that each person should serve as a director.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Director Independence
Our board of directors has determined that each of Ms. Breen, Ms. Carnahan and Messrs. Diehl, Reiner and Waters is an "independent director" for purposes of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act as the term relates to membership on the board of directors.
The definition of independence under the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the "Nasdaq Listing Rules") includes a series of objective tests, such as that the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of his or her family members, has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, as further required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, our board has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no material relationships exist that, in the opinion of our board, would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In making these determinations, our board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors in questionnaires with questions tailored to the Nasdaq Listing Rules with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to us and our management.
Board of Directors Leadership Structure
The board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines to promote the functioning of the board and its committees. These guidelines address board composition, board functions and responsibilities, qualifications, leadership structure, committees and meetings.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines do not contain a policy mandating the separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, and the board is given the flexibility to select its Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer in the manner that it believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer may be filled by one individual or two. The board has chosen to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We believe this structure is optimal for us because it avoids any duplication of effort between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and permits our Chief Executive Officer to focus his efforts on the day-to-day management of the Company. This separation provides strong leadership for the board and the Company through the Chairman, while also positioning our Chief Executive Officer as our leader in the eyes of our employees and other stakeholders. The board may reconsider the best board leadership structure for us from time to time.
Risk Management
Our risk management function is overseen by our board of directors. Through our management reports and company policies, such as our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our audit committee's and compensation committee's review of financial and other risks, we keep our board of directors apprised of material risks and provide our directors access to all information necessary for them to understand and evaluate how these risks interrelate, how they affect us and how our management addresses those risks. Mr. Beauchamp, as our Chief Executive Officer, works with our independent directors and with management when material risks are identified by the board of directors or management to address such risk. If the identified risk poses an actual or potential conflict with management, our independent directors would conduct an assessment by themselves.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Executive Sessions and Lead Independent Director
Non-management directors generally meet in executive session each time the board of directors holds a regularly scheduled meeting. The board's policy is to hold executive sessions without the presence of management as a part of all regular board meetings, and, in any event, at least twice during each calendar year. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a non-management independent director shall be chosen to preside at each executive session.
The board of directors has elected a non-management director to serve in a lead capacity ("Lead Independent Director") to coordinate the activities of the other non-management directors, and to perform any other duties and responsibilities that the board of directors may determine. While the board annually elects a Lead Independent Director, it is generally expected that he or she will serve for more than one year. Our current Lead Independent Director is Ronald V. Waters III.
Meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees
The board of directors held four meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. During the last fiscal year, each of our directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the board and all of the committees of the board on which such director served during that period.
The following table sets forth the standing committees of the board of directors, the members of each committee and the Lead Independent Director as of the date that this Proxy Statement was first made available to our stockholders:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Director Nominations
Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things, assisting our board of directors in identifying qualified director nominees and recommending nominees for each annual meeting of stockholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee's goal is to assemble a board that brings to our company a diversity of experience in areas that are relevant to our business and that complies with the Nasdaq Listing Rules and applicable SEC rules and regulations. While we do not have a formal diversity policy for board membership, the nominating and corporate governance committee generally considers the diversity of nominees in terms of knowledge, experience, background, skills, expertise and other demographic factors. When considering nominees for election as directors, the nominating and corporate governance committee reviews the needs of the board for various skills, background, experience and expected contributions and the qualification standards established from time to time by the nominating and corporate governance committee. The nominating and corporate governance committee believes that directors must also have an inquisitive and objective outlook and mature judgment. Director candidates must have sufficient time available in the judgment of the nominating and corporate governance committee to perform all board and committee responsibilities. Members of the board of directors are expected to rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in all meetings of the board and applicable committee meetings.
Other than the foregoing and the applicable rules regarding director qualification, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees. Under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, at least a majority of the members of the board must meet the definition of "independence" and at least one director must be a "financial expert" under the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq Listing Rules and applicable SEC rules and regulations. The nominating and corporate governance committee also believes it appropriate for our Chief Executive Officer to participate as a member of the board of directors.
The nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates annually the current members of the board whose terms are expiring and who are willing to continue in service against the criteria set forth above in determining whether to recommend these directors for election. The nominating and corporate governance committee will assess regularly the optimum size of the board and its committees and the needs of the board for various skills, background and business experience in determining if the board requires additional candidates for nomination.
Candidates for director nominations come to our attention from time to time through incumbent directors, management, stockholders or third parties. These candidates may be considered at meetings of the nominating and corporate governance committee at any point during the year. Such candidates are to be evaluated against the criteria set forth above. If the nominating and corporate governance committee believes at any time that it is desirable that the board consider additional candidates for nomination, the committee may poll directors and management for suggestions or conduct research to identify possible candidates and may engage, if the nominating and corporate governance committee believes it is appropriate, a third-party search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates.
Our bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual meeting. The nominating and corporate governance committee will consider director candidates validly recommended by stockholders. For more information regarding the requirements for stockholders to validly submit a nomination for director, see "Stockholder Proposals or Nominations to Be Presented at Next Annual Meeting" elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.
Compensation of Directors
In September 2014, we implemented a director compensation package, pursuant to which our directors are eligible to receive equity awards and cash retainers as compensation for service on our board of directors and committees of our board of directors. Under our director compensation package, our directors are entitled to receive a $30,000 annual retainer fee. The audit committee chairperson receives an annual fee of $20,000, and members of the audit committee receive an annual fee of $10,000. The compensation committee chairperson receives an annual fee of $15,000, and members of the compensation committee receive an annual fee of $7,500. The nominating and corporate governance committee chairperson receives an annual fee of $10,000, and the members of the nominating and corporate governance committee receive an annual fee of $5,000. The Lead Independent Director receives an annual fee of $16,500.
Table of Contents
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We also grant members of our board of directors stock awards in addition to the cash compensation described above. In August 2018, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved a restricted stock unit grant entitling each director to receive that number of shares of our common stock equal to $165,000 divided by the then 30 trading day average closing price of our common stock. These grants vest 25% quarterly, such that the grant vests in full on the first anniversary of the grant, provided that the director continues to serve as a director through such vesting date. In August 2018, our board of directors affirmed that the director's cash and equity compensation package for fiscal 2019 would remain unchanged from the compensation package for fiscal 2018.
The following table sets forth information concerning the compensation earned during the last fiscal year by each director who received such compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer did not receive additional compensation for his service as a director and, consequently, no additional compensation is included in the table. The compensation received by our Chief Executive Officer as an employee is presented under "Compensation of Named Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table."

(1)  Amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the year computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Assumptions used in calculating the amounts reported in this column are set forth in Note 13 "Benefit Plans" of the audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-approval of Audit and Non-audit Services Performed by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The audit committee has determined that all services performed by KPMG are compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG. The audit committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Unless the specific service has been pre-approved with respect to that year, the audit committee must approve the permitted service before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to perform it. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the audit committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval process.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The audit committee currently consists of three directors. Messrs. Diehl and Waters and Ms. Carnahan are each, in the judgment of the board of directors, an independent director. The audit committee acts pursuant to a written charter that has been adopted by the board of directors. A copy of the charter is available on the investor relations section of Paylocity's website at http://investors.paylocity.com.
The audit committee oversees Paylocity's financial reporting process on behalf of the board of directors. The audit committee is responsible for retaining Paylocity's independent registered public accounting firm, evaluating its independence, qualifications and performance, and approving in advance the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for all audit and non-audit services. The audit committee's specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter. The audit committee reviews its charter at least annually.
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the financial reporting process, including internal control systems, and procedures designed to insure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Paylocity's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, is responsible for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of our audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles.
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed with management the company's audited financial statements. The audit committee has also discussed with KPMG LLP all matters that the independent registered public accounting firm was required to communicate and discuss with the audit committee, including the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as such standard may be further modified, supplemented or amended from time to time (or such successor standard that may be promulgated). In addition, the audit committee has met with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the overall scope of the independent registered public accounting firm's audit, the results of its examinations, its evaluations of the company's internal controls and the overall quality of Paylocity's financial reporting.
The audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to Paylocity's board of directors that the company's audited financial statements be included in Paylocity's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from currently planned programs as summarized in this discussion.
This section discusses the philosophy underlying our executive compensation policies and decisions and the most important factors relevant to an analysis of these policies and decisions. It provides qualitative information regarding the manner and context in which compensation is awarded to and earned in fiscal 2018 by the following named executive officers and places in perspective the data presented in the tables and narrative that follow:
We refer to these executive officers collectively in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related compensation tables as the "named executive officers." We refer to our compensation committee in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related compensation tables as the "Committee." The members of the Committee in fiscal 2018 were Ellen Carnahan, Mark H. Mishler, Andres D. Reiner and Ronald V. Waters III. Ms. Carnahan was appointed to the Committee on January 26, 2018, while Mr. Mishler ceased serving on the Committee upon his resignation from the board of directors on January 25, 2018.
Fiscal 2018 Financial and Business Highlights
In fiscal 2018, we continued to execute our strategy of growing our client base, expanding our product offerings, increasing average revenue per client, extending technological leadership and further developing our referral network. Our named executive officers and other members of our executive management team led the organization to achieve certain operational and financial milestones that position us for continued short- and long-term success, including the following achievements:

 10%  increase in average recurring revenue per client      25% new business revenue from broker referrals     22% adjusted EBITDA margin*  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
The following key compensation actions were taken with respect to the named executive officers for fiscal 2018:
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The total compensation program for our named executive officers is designed to attract, retain and reward individuals by motivating them to contribute to the growth and profitability of the Company. We seek to achieve these objectives by providing compensation that is competitive with the practices of other peer group technology companies and linking rewards to Company and individual performance by providing incentives intended to motivate our named executive officers to increase long-term stockholder value in alignment with stockholders' interests.
The Role of the Committee and its Consultants and Advisors
The Committee's primary duties are to regularly meet, review and advise our board of directors on the Company's overall compensation philosophy, policies and plans, including a review of both regional and industry compensation practices and trends. The Committee is responsible for taking action with respect to compensation that will attract and retain the highest quality executives that will clearly articulate the relationship of corporate performance to executive compensation and that will reward executives for the Company's progress. For a more complete description of the duties and responsibilities of the Committee, see the charter for the Committee posted on our website at: http://investors.paylocity.com.
The Committee has engaged Compensia, an outside independent executive compensation consultant, to assist the Committee with executive compensation matters by providing market research and advisory support for base salary, bonus and equity compensation matters and to assist the Committee with assessing the Company's peer group. Compensia annually develops a peer group study and an executive compensation review that is specific to the Company. Compensia does not provide other services to the Company. The Committee also uses the services of the Company's human resources department and the Company's outside counsel in making compensation-related decisions involving our named executive officers.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Role of Named Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions
The compensation of all of our named executive officers is determined by the Committee. Our CEO and CFO typically provide an agenda and recommendations to the Committee. Our CEO attends the Committee meetings and discusses with the Committee the compensation and performance of all executive officers, other than himself. Our CEO bases his recommendations in part upon his review of the performance of our executive officers. The Committee may exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended compensation adjustments or awards to such named executive officers.
Components of Executive Compensation
Our equity compensation program is structured to align the long-term pay of our named executive officers with shareholder interests. We believe that equity awards are a significant compensation-related motivator in attracting and retaining executive-level employees, and our executive compensation program aims to appropriately balance the goals of motivating and rewarding our executive officers, thereby promoting stability in our leadership.
To promote alignment of our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders and to focus our executives on achievement of certain annual performance-based metrics that the Committee considers critical to the Company's future success, we also have an annual cash bonus program that varies above or below target levels commensurate with our performance. In addition, we have executive employment agreements with each of our named executive officers in order to secure their positions with the Company and to increase the executives' focus with the Company notwithstanding the high demand for services that may exist within the executives' locality and the Company's competitors in the technology sector.
We offer our named executive officers compensation in the following forms:
Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program. Therefore, we generally do not provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers except in situations where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective, and for recruitment and retention purposes. During fiscal 2018, other than the car allowance provided to Mr. Haske and the housing and commuting expenses provided to Mr. Williams, none of the named executive officers received perquisites or other personal benefits that were, in the aggregate, $10,000 or more for each individual. In addition, we do not provide our named executive officers retirement plan benefits or health and welfare plan benefits that deviate from what is generally offered to employees of the Company.
We view these components of compensation as related, but the Committee does not review total compensation for the named executive officers in making a decision with regard to a component of compensation because the Committee does not believe that significant compensation derived from one component of compensation should negate or reduce compensation from other components. The Committee instead believes that each component of compensation is intended to reward different goals, as well as skills, responsibilities and duties of the executive. As a result, the appropriate level for each compensation component is based in part, but not exclusively, on survey data and our recruiting and retention goals, our view of internal equity and consistency and other considerations we deem relevant, such as rewarding extraordinary performance, for such component of compensation.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In determining named executive officer compensation, the Company considers the following factors:
The Committee performs an annual strategic review of compensation for our named executive officers and the Company's peer group to determine whether we provide adequate incentives and motivation to our named executive officers. To this end, the Committee reviews survey data and compensation data of peer companies annually when it reviews named executive officer compensation.
For fiscal 2018, the Committee, based on an analysis put together by Compensia, developed the Company's peer group for purposes of advising the Committee on its assessment of base salary, equity compensation and variable cash bonus opportunities for our named executive officers. After comments from Company management, the Committee reviewed the peer group assessment criteria, including peer group company location, industry, direct peers, revenue, revenue ranges, market capitalization, increases in market capitalization and revenue growth rate. None of the criteria are fixed and the Committee retains the discretion to determine the Company's peer group for compensation purposes. For fiscal 2018, our peer group as determined by the Committee consisted of the following:
Notwithstanding the use of a peer group analysis to assess named executive officer compensation, the Committee does not benchmark individual components of compensation or the total compensation paid to our named executive officers. The Committee also does not consider realized or realizable pay in making compensation decisions. The Committee makes decisions on named executive officer compensation for each component thereof based on a variety of factors described above.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Base Compensation
The Committee reviews and reassesses the base salaries of our named executive officers following the completion of each fiscal year. In determining base salaries for our named executive officers for fiscal 2018, the Committee reviewed our peer group and considered advisory data provided by Compensia, as well as the tenure, performance and contribution in the prior fiscal year. Following this analysis, the Committee determined that adjustments were necessary in some cases to maintain the competitiveness of our executive officers' base salaries and to foster retention. The Committee increased the base salaries of each of our named executive officers in fiscal 2018, with the exception of Mr. Williams who was hired on September 18, 2017. We do not choose to consider other elements of pay in setting base salaries for our named executive officers because of our philosophy that base salary should be measured by market practices and individual performance. Our Committee may periodically conduct a review of our executive officers' base salaries and determine adjustments as warranted, if any.
In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the base compensation for our named executive officers was as follows:
Variable Compensation under Our Annual Bonus Plan
We maintain a variable compensation plan in the form of an annual cash bonus plan to reward the performance of our named executive officers in achieving our corporate goals and to primarily align this element of pay for our named executive officers with corporate performance. Based on the Committee's review of survey data from peer group analysis, the target bonus opportunity under our annual cash bonus plan for each of our named executive officers was maintained at competitive levels.
In early fiscal 2018, our Committee determined that corporate performance measures for fiscal 2017 had been achieved, including total revenue and adjusted EBITDA at 90% of target for fiscal 2017. Accordingly, the Committee determined that our named executive officers had earned and would be paid the following cash bonuses under our annual cash bonus plan for fiscal 2017, which were paid in fiscal 2018:
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For fiscal 2018, our Committee established corporate performance goals of total revenue and adjusted EBITDA and, except with respect to Messrs. Beauchamp, Williams and Haske, individual role-specific measures and criteria to assess the cash bonus opportunity for each named executive officer.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Steven R. Beauchamp     — 
 Toby J. Williams     — 
 Michael R. Haske     — 
 Edward W. Gaty       
 Mark S. Kinsey       
[END TABLE]
We focused on these factors in our annual cash bonus plan for fiscal 2018 because they are important indicators of our ability to monetize our products and services. The corporate performance measures were given different weighting based on each individual's role with the Company and the individual's ability to drive the specific goal that was targeted. At the time the corporate performance measures were set, the Committee believed that these corporate performance measures provided a more accurate gauge of our success and that the achievement of the corporate performance measures at the target levels would require extraordinary efforts, excellent leadership, effective leveraging of our competencies and a focus on driving results. In early fiscal 2019, our Committee determined that corporate performance measures for fiscal 2018 had been exceeded, including total revenue and adjusted EBITDA at 135% of target for fiscal 2018. Accordingly, the Committee determined that our named executive officers had earned and would be paid the following cash bonuses under our annual cash bonus plan for fiscal 2018, which were paid in fiscal 2019:
Equity Compensation
Currently, the equity compensation issued to each of our named executive officers consists primarily of restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards. The amount and type of equity awards granted to our named executive officers reflects the Committee's desire to remain competitive with the Company's peer group while taking into consideration overall retention goals and achievement of corporate executives. For fiscal 2018, we remained competitive for positioning the equity awards granted to our named executive officers due to recent corporate performance and a strong desire to retain our named executive officers during an upcoming period that we feel will be critical to the Company's growth and our long-term strategic planning. Accordingly, certain equity awards granted to our named executive officers in fiscal 2018 include retention attributes that are weighted to fiscal 2019.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Because RSUs representing the right to receive shares of our common stock upon settlement have value even in the absence of stock price appreciation, the Committee believes we are able to incent and retain our named executive officers using fewer shares of our common stock, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of our long-term equity awards and allowing us to use our equity compensation resources more efficiently. Since their value increases with any increase in the value of the underlying shares, RSUs serve as an incentive which aligns with the long-term interests of our executive officers and stockholders. In addition, the multi-year vesting requirement serves our retention objectives since our executive officers must remain continuously employed by us through the applicable vesting dates to fully earn these awards. In fiscal 2018, the Committee did not grant any stock options to our named executive officers.
In fiscal 2018, we granted the following RSU awards to our named executive officers as an effective retention tool that rewards continued service with us:
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Vests 25% per year following the date of grant subject to continued service through each applicable vesting date. 
**  Vests based on certain compounded annual revenue growth rates through fiscal 2019 measured from fiscal 2017 and average adjusted EBITDA margin for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Severance and Change of Control Payments
In connection with the hiring of certain named executive officers, we have provided, often through the process of negotiation, for certain severance and change of control benefits in the event of termination of employment under specified circumstances in their employment agreement. For quantification of any additional information regarding the severance and change of control benefits, please see the discussion under "Compensation of Named Executive Officers—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
Retirement, Welfare and Other Benefits
We have established a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan for all employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the statutory limit, $18,000 and $18,500 in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and have us contribute the amount of this reduction to the 401(k) plan. During fiscal 2018, we matched up to 50% of employee contributions, but not exceeding 8% of eligible pay. Our contributions for the year ended June 30, 2018 were $4,632,000. We intend for the 401(k) plan to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code so that contributions by employees or by us to the 401(k) plan and income earned on plan contributions should not be taxable to employees until distributed from the 401(k) plan.
In addition, we provide welfare benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis as all of our full-time employees. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision benefits, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and basic life insurance coverage.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
We believe that our employee benefits programs are affordable and competitive in relation to the market based on our understanding of the markets in which we compete for talent. We adjust our employee benefits programs as needed based upon regular monitoring of applicable laws and practices and the competitive market.
Other than Mr. Haske's car allowance and the housing and commuting expenses provided to Mr. Williams, we do not provide additional perquisites to our executive officers. In the future, we may provide perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as when we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual named executive officer in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective, or for recruitment, motivation, security or retention purposes. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be subject to required approval and review by the Committee.
Other Compensation Policies
Stock Ownership or Holding Guidelines
On August 12, 2016, we adopted stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors, chief executive officer and other named executive officers. Our non-employee directors, chief executive officer and other named executive officers are required to own shares of our common stock with a value equal to at least the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Annual cash retainer excludes any fees for serving as Lead Independent Director, chairing a committee or serving on a committee. 
[END TABLE]
Each individual has five years from the later of the date of adoption of these guidelines or the date of appointment of the individual as a director or a named executive officer of our company to achieve the required ownership levels. We believe that these guidelines promote the alignment of the long-term interests of our named executive officers and members of our board of directors with our stockholders. Under our stock ownership guidelines, only shares owned outright count toward the satisfaction of the ownership guidelines. Subject to the phase in periods, the non-employee directors, chief executive officer and other named executive officers are currently compliant with the stock ownership guidelines.
Compensation Recovery Policy
We have not adopted a separate executive compensation clawback policy. Our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, however, provides that if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct of our CEO or CFO who knowingly or through gross negligence engaged in the misconduct, the CEO or CFO must reimburse the Company for any payment in settlement of an equity award received during the twelve-month period following the filing of the financial document and any profits realized from the sale of securities during such twelve-month period.
In addition, we will comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and will adopt a compensation recovery policy to the extent required by law once the Securities and Exchange Commission adopts final regulations on the subject.
Policy on Hedging and Pledging
Our insider trading policy provides that no one subject to the policy may engage in short sales, puts, calls or other derivative transactions involving our securities. It further provides that no one subject to the policy may engage in hedging or monetization transactions involving our securities, pledge our securities as collateral for a loan, or hold our securities in a margin account.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Policy Regarding the Pricing and Timing of Equity Awards
While we have not yet adopted a formal policy regarding the timing of equity awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, it has been our practice as a public company, which we expect to continue, that equity award grants occur after the release of any earnings statement and that stock options have an exercise price not less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
All outstanding equity awards to our named executive officers have been granted and reflected in our consolidated financial statements, based upon the applicable accounting guidance, at the closing price of our stock on the date of grant.
Risk Considerations
The Committee has assessed whether the compensation paid to our named executive officers encourages risk-taking behavior, and the Committee does not believe that the compensation programs for our named executive officers are likely to lead to taking on more risks than are appropriate from a sound business judgment perspective. The Committee's approach to compensation beyond base salary focuses heavily on company-wide and long-term performance. For instance, for fiscal 2018, incentives underlying annual cash bonuses were primarily tied to Company performance measures. Since this metric has a Company-wide focus, the Committee does not believe that it generally incentivizes high-risk behavior by our named executive officers compared to annual bonuses based upon narrowly focused individual performance. Similarly, the Company's equity awards may consist of stock options and restricted stock units. The performance of both compensation elements generally reflects the overall market performance of the Company's stock over a long period of time. The Committee does not believe that this structure of equity awards incentivizes high-risk behavior. Our compensation schemes are designed to be in place over several years, and the Committee believes they are designed to reward sustained long-term profitable growth of the Company.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) (as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("the Act")) generally disallows publicly-held corporations from taking a tax deduction for federal income tax purposes for remuneration paid in excess of $1 million in any taxable year to executive officers that qualify as covered employees under section 162(m). The Committee may, in its judgment, authorize compensation payments that may be in excess of the limits set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and do not comply with exemptions, if any, from the deductibility limit when it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent.
No Reimbursement for "Golden Parachute" Taxes
Internal Revenue Code Sections 280G and 4999 provide that executive officers and directors who hold significant equity interests and certain other service providers may be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of the company that exceed certain prescribed limits and that the company (or a successor) may forfeit a deduction on the amounts subject to this additional tax. We have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any named executive officer with a reimbursement or "gross-up" payment for any tax liability that the executive might owe as a result of the application of Internal Revenue Code Section 4999.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
We account for equity compensation under the rules of FASB ASC 718, which requires us to estimate and record an expense over the service period of the award. Accounting rules also require us to record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is accrued.
Response to the 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and Future Advisory Vote
At the 2018 annual meeting, the stockholders of the Company had the opportunity, pursuant to SEC regulations, to have an advisory vote to approve the compensation paid to the named executive officers. The results of the vote were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 46,833,611 votes were "For" the compensation paid to our named executive officers; 
● 445,570 votes were "Against" the compensation paid to our named executive officers; and 
● 66,916 votes abstained. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the above results, approximately 98.92% of votes cast at the 2018 annual meeting supported the compensation paid to our named executive officers. Our Committee considered these results in light of the Company's corporate structure, and determined that no significant changes were required to the Company's compensation program as a result of the vote.
Following a stockholder non-binding advisory vote at the 2017 annual meeting, the board of directors adopted a policy to conduct future stockholder non-binding advisory votes regarding the compensation to be paid by the Company to its named executive officers every one year. This policy will remain in effect until the occurrence of the next advisory vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote or until the board of directors determines that a different frequency for such advisory vote is in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.

Summary Compensation Table
The following table presents compensation information for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 paid to, or earned by, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers as of June 30, 2018. We refer to these executive officers as our "named executive officers" in this Proxy Statement. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our named executive officers were Steven R. Beauchamp, Toby J. Williams, Michael R. Haske, Edward W. Gaty and Mark S. Kinsey. No disclosure is provided for persons for years in which the executive officer was not a named executive officer.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing disclosure regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Beauchamp, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), to that of our median employee. SEC rules allow us to select a methodology for identifying our median employee in a manner that is most appropriate based on our size, organizational structure and compensation plans, policies and procedures.
In determining our median employee, we chose June 30, 2018, the last day of our recently completed fiscal year, as the determination date. As of that date, we employed 2,600 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees, all located in the United States. Contractors and other non-employees were not included in our employee population. Our median employee was determined based on total annual base pay, the value of annual cash incentive awards and other cash compensation paid in fiscal 2018 (bonuses, commissions, overtime, etc.) and the grant date fair value of equity awards granted during fiscal 2018 for all employees except our CEO and the 33 employees hired as a result of our acquisition of Beneflex HR Resources, Inc. in March 2018. We annualized the base pay and any applicable sales commissions for those employees who commenced work or were on a partial year leave of absence during fiscal 2018.
Once we identified the median employee, we calculated that employee's compensation utilizing the same methodology reflected under "Compensation of Named Executive Officers – Summary Compensation Table." Based on our calculation for fiscal 2018, our CEO's annual total compensation was $6,290,454 and our median employee's annual total compensation was $75,631. Accordingly, we estimated our CEO Pay Ratio for fiscal 2018 to be 83:1. We believe this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules, based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

In addition, each of Messrs. Beauchamp, Williams, Haske, Gaty and Kinsey is subject to certain obligations relating to non-competition, non-solicitation, proprietary information and assignment of inventions. Pursuant to these obligations, each named executive officer has agreed not to solicit our employees or customers during employment and for a period of 12 months after the termination of employment, not to compete with us or assist any other person to compete with us during employment and for a period of 12 months after the termination of employment, and to protect our confidential and proprietary information and to assign to us intellectual property developed during the course of employment.
The table below estimates the payments and benefits that each of our named executive officers would have received in the event his employment had been involuntarily terminated without death, disability or "cause" (as defined in each of their respective employment agreements and discussed in "Compensation of Named Executive Officers – Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control"), not in connection with a change in control as of June 30, 2018.

Summary of Equity Plans
2008 Equity Incentive Plan
Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders on May 13, 2008, and was most recently amended in June 2012. Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock awards (both restricted and unrestricted) and restricted stock unit awards to our employees, directors, consultants and independent contractors. We no longer grant awards under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. Instead, we have granted equity awards under our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan after our initial public offering. However, our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of all outstanding equity awards granted under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan.
The standard form of option agreement under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan provides that options will vest 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date, with the remainder vesting in equal annual installments over the vesting schedule, subject to continued service through each applicable vesting date. Under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, our board of directors has the authority to provide for accelerated vesting in connection with a change in control, as defined in the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. In the event of a change in control, our board of directors may require the substitution of outstanding equity awards for similar rights in the acquiring entity. In the alternative, our board of directors may provide that all outstanding options be canceled in exchange for an amount per option share equal to the greater of (i) the highest per share price offered to the holders of our common stock in the change in control minus the exercise price per option share or (ii) the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the change in control minus the exercise price per option share. In the case of outstanding shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units, our board of directors may provide that such shares or units be canceled in exchange for an amount per share or unit equal to the greater of (i) the highest per share price offered to the holders of our common stock in the change in control or (ii) the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of the change in control.
Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan provides that our board of directors, or its designated committee, will equitably and proportionally adjust or substitute outstanding awards upon certain events, including, without limitation, changes in our capitalization through stock splits, recapitalizations, mergers or consolidations. The standard form of option agreement under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan provides that the participants will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, hypothecate, grant any option to purchase or make any short sale of, or otherwise dispose of any shares of our stock or any rights to acquire our stock for such period of time from and after the effective date of this registration statement as may be established by the underwriter of our initial public offering.
2014 Equity Incentive Plan
Our 2014 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by our board of directors and our stockholders in February 2014 and became effective immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering in March 2014. The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan serves as the successor to the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. It is intended to make available incentives that will assist us to attract, retain and motivate employees (including officers), consultants and directors. We may provide these incentives through the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units and other cash-based or stock-based awards.
As of June 30, 2018, options to purchase 1,906,833 shares of our common stock and 1,879,330 restricted stock units were outstanding. In addition, a total of 10,029,843 shares of our common stock were authorized and reserved for future grant under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. This reserve will automatically increase on January 1, 2019 and each subsequent anniversary through 2024, by an amount equal to the lesser of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 4.5% of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31 or 
● an amount determined by our board of directors. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and other numerical limits in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and in outstanding awards to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights in the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to awards which expire or are cancelled or forfeited will again become available for issuance under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The shares available are not reduced by awards settled in cash or by shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations; the net number of shares issued upon the exercise of stock appreciation rights or options exercised by means of a net exercise or by tender of previously owned shares will be deducted from the shares available under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.
The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan is generally administered by the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the Committee determines in its discretion the persons to whom and the times at which awards are granted, the sizes of such awards and all of their terms and conditions. The Committee has the authority to construe and interpret the terms of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and awards granted under it. The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provides, subject to certain limitations, for indemnification by us of any director, officer or employee against all judgments, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any legal action arising from such person's action or failure to act in administering the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.
The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the Committee, without further stockholder approval, to provide for the cancellation of stock options or stock appreciation rights with exercise prices in excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock in exchange for new options or other equity awards with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock or a cash payment.
Awards may be granted under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to our employees (including named executive officers), directors or consultants or those of any present or future parent or subsidiary corporation or other affiliated entity. All awards are evidenced by a written agreement between us and the holder of the award and may include any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Stock options. We may grant nonstatutory stock options or incentive stock options (as described in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code), each of which gives its holder  the right, during a specified term (not exceeding 10 years) and subject to any specified vesting or other conditions, to purchase a number of shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share determined by the administrator, which may not be less  than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. 
● Stock appreciation rights. A stock appreciation right gives its holder the right, during a specified term (not exceeding 10 years) and subject to any specified vesting or  other conditions, to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the date of grant of the award and the date of its exercise. We may pay the appreciation in shares of our common stock or in cash, except that a stock  appreciation right granted in tandem with a related option is payable only in stock. 
● Restricted stock. The administrator may grant restricted stock awards either as a bonus or as a purchase right at such price as the administrator determines. Shares of  restricted stock remain subject to forfeiture until vested based on such terms and conditions as the administrator specifies. Holders of restricted stock will have the right to vote the shares and to receive any dividends paid, except that the dividends  may be subject to the same vesting conditions as the related shares. 
● Restricted stock units. Restricted stock units represent rights to receive shares of our common stock (or their value in cash) at a future date without payment of a purchase  price (unless required under applicable state corporate laws), subject to vesting or other conditions specified by the administrator. Holders of restricted stock units have no voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends unless and until shares of  common stock are issued in settlement of such awards. The administrator, however, may grant restricted stock units that entitle their holders to dividend equivalent rights. 
● Performance shares and performance units. Performance shares and performance units are awards that will result in a payment to their holder only if specified performance goals  are achieved during a specified performance period. Performance share awards are rights denominated in shares of our common stock, while performance unit awards are rights denominated in dollars. The administrator establishes the applicable performance goals based  on one or more 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
[BEGIN TABLE]
  measures of business performance enumerated in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, such as net revenues, gross margin, net income or total stockholder return. To the extent earned, performance share and unit awards  may be settled in cash or in shares of our common stock. Holders of performance shares or performance units have no voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends unless and until shares of common stock are issued in settlement of such awards. The  administrator, however, may grant performance shares that entitle their holders to dividend equivalent rights. 
● Cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The administrator may grant cash-based awards that specify a monetary payment or range of payments or other stock-based awards  that specify a number or range of shares or units that, in either case, are subject to vesting or other conditions specified by the administrator. Settlement of these awards may be in cash or shares of our common stock, as determined by the  administrator. The holder will have no voting rights or right to receive cash dividends unless and until shares of our common stock are issued pursuant to the award. The administrator may grant equivalent dividend rights with respect to other stock-based  awards. 
[END TABLE]
In the event of a change in control as described in the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, the acquiring or successor entity may assume or continue all or any awards outstanding under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan or substitute substantially equivalent awards. Any awards which are not assumed or continued in connection with a change in control or are not exercised or settled prior to the change in control will terminate effective as of the time of the change in control. The Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting of any or all outstanding awards upon such terms and to such extent as it determines, except that the vesting of all awards held by members of the board of directors who are not employees will automatically be accelerated in full. The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan also authorizes the Committee, in its discretion and without the consent of any participant, to cancel each or any outstanding award denominated in shares upon a change in control in exchange for a payment to the participant with respect to each share subject to the cancelled award of an amount equal to the excess of the consideration to be paid per share of common stock in the change in control transaction over the exercise price per share, if any, under the award.
The 2014 Equity Incentive Plan will continue in effect until it is terminated by the administrator, provided, however, that all awards will be granted, if at all, within 10 years of its effective date. The administrator may amend, suspend or terminate the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan at any time, provided that without stockholder approval, the plan cannot be amended to increase the number of shares authorized, change the class of persons eligible to receive incentive stock options, or effect any other change that would require stockholder approval under any applicable law or listing rule.
2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In connection with our initial public offering in 2014, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). A total of 1,110,259 shares of our common stock are available for sale under our ESPP. In addition, our ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on January 1 of each year through 2024, equal to the lesser of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 400,000 shares; 
● 0.75% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock on the immediately preceding December 31; or 
● such other amount as may be determined by our board of directors. 
[END TABLE]
Appropriate adjustments will be made in the number of authorized shares and in outstanding purchase rights to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights in the event of a stock split or other change in our capital structure. Shares subject to purchase rights which expire or are cancelled will again become available for issuance under the ESPP.
The Committee administers and has full authority to interpret the terms of the ESPP. The ESPP provides, subject to certain limitations, for indemnification by us of any director, officer or employee against all judgments, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any legal action arising from such person's action or failure to act in administering the ESPP.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
All of our employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us for more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under our ESPP if such employee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● immediately after the grant would own stock or options to purchase stock possessing 5.0% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock; or 
● holds rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of our stock for each calendar year in which the right to be granted would be  outstanding at any time. 
[END TABLE]
Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP will typically be implemented through consecutive offering periods, generally starting on the first trading day on or after May 16 and November 16 of each year, except for the first such offering period, which will commence on a date to be determined by the administrator. The administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods, including establishing offering periods of up to 27 months and providing for multiple purchase dates.
Our ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of no less than 1% and up to 10% of their eligible cash compensation, which includes a participant's regular base wages or salary and payments of overtime, shift premiums and paid time off before deduction of taxes and certain compensation deferrals.
Amounts deducted and accumulated from participant compensation are used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each offering period. Unless otherwise provided by the administrator, the purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the purchase date. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period and will receive a refund of their account balances not yet used to purchase shares. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.
Prior to the beginning of any offering period, the administrator may alter the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by any participant during the offering period or specify a maximum aggregate number of shares that may be purchased by all participants in the offering period. If insufficient shares remain available under the plan to permit all participants to purchase the number of shares to which they would otherwise be entitled, the administrator will make a pro rata allocation of the available shares. Any amounts withheld from participants' compensation in excess of the amounts used to purchase shares will be refunded without interest.
A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided under the ESPP. In the event of a change in control, an acquiring or successor corporation may assume our rights and obligations under outstanding purchase rights or substitute substantially equivalent purchase rights. If the acquiring or successor corporation does not assume or substitute for outstanding purchase rights, then the purchase date of the offering periods then in progress will be accelerated to a date prior to the change in control. Our ESPP will continue in effect until terminated by the administrator. The Committee has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our ESPP at any time.
Pension Benefits
We did not sponsor any defined benefit pension or other actuarial plan for our named executive officers during fiscal 2018.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
We did not maintain any nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plans or arrangements for our named executive officers during fiscal 2018.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION
We currently maintain three compensation plans that provide for the issuance of our common stock to officers and other employees, directors and consultants. These consist of the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"), the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") and the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), each of which has been approved by our stockholders. The following table sets forth information regarding outstanding options and shares reserved for future issuance under the foregoing plans as of June 30, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]

(2)  Includes 10,029,843 shares of common stock available for issuance in connection with future awards under our 2014 Plan and 1,110,259 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ESPP.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related Party Transaction Policy
We have a written policy on authorizations, the Related Party Transactions Policy, which includes specific provisions for related party transactions. Pursuant to the Related Party Transactions Policy, related party transactions include any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of such transactions, including any indebtedness or guarantees, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. In the event that a related party transaction is identified, such transaction must be reported to our Corporate Secretary and subsequently must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the chairman of our audit committee or our full audit committee, depending on the amount of the transaction. Any member of the audit committee who is one of the parties in the related party transaction and who has a direct material interest in the transaction may not participate in the approval of the transaction. The audit committee has pre-approved certain potential related party transactions in advance including employment of executive officers and director compensation.
Related Party Transactions
During fiscal 2018, there has not been, nor is there currently proposed, any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or are a party in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, except for the compensation and other arrangements described in "Compensation of Named Executive Officers" and "Corporate Governance—Compensation of Directors" elsewhere in this Proxy Statement and the transactions described below.
Stock Options Granted to Executive Officers and Directors
We have granted stock options and restricted stock units to our executive officers. We have also granted restricted stock units to our board of directors. For more information regarding certain of these equity awards, see "Corporate Governance—Compensation of Directors," "Compensation of Named Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table" and elsewhere in this Proxy Statement.
Investor Rights Agreement
We are party to an amended and restated investor rights agreement with certain of our stockholders. The amended and restated investor rights agreement grants such stockholders certain registration rights, which include demand registration rights, piggyback registration rights and short-form registration rights, with respect to shares of our common stock.
Table of Contents
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Employment Agreements
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. These employment agreements provide for severance payments upon termination of the executive in certain circumstances and acceleration of vesting of stock options and time-based restricted stock units upon the occurrence of a change in control. Please see "Compensation of Named Executive Officers—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" elsewhere in this Proxy Statement for a summary of the potential payments to our named executive officers upon the occurrence of termination or a change in control.
Indemnification of Officers and Directors
As permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, no director will be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Pursuant to Delaware law, such protection would be not available for liability:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;  
● for any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit; or  
● for an act or omission for which the liability of a director is expressly provided by an applicable statute, including unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
[END TABLE]
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that if Delaware law is amended after the approval by our stockholders of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that we are required to advance expenses to our directors and officers as incurred in connection with legal proceedings against them for which they may be indemnified and that the rights conferred in the amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive.
We have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These agreements, among other things, require us to indemnify each director and officer to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws for expenses such as, among other things, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by the director or executive officer in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in our right, arising out of the person's services as our director or executive officer or as the director or executive officer of any subsidiary of ours or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. We also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance.
Other Related Party Transactions
In June 2014, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the "Memorandum"), with our chairman Steven I. Sarowitz and Blue Marble Payroll, LLC ("Blue Marble"), a separate legal entity owned by Mr. Sarowitz. Pursuant to the terms of the Memorandum, Mr. Sarowitz is entitled to devote his efforts to Blue Marble provided that such efforts do not interfere with his ability to fulfill his duties as our chairman. Mr. Sarowitz and Blue Marble each also agreed not to compete with us in the United States of America and not to solicit our employees. In the event that we enter a geographic market in which Mr. Sarowitz or Blue Marble has clients, we have an option to acquire Mr. Sarowitz' or Blue Marble's (as the case may be) operations in such market at fair market value. At our option, Mr. Sarowitz and Blue Marble will permit us to become a partner of Blue Marble in any international market that Mr. Sarowitz or Blue Marble enters, on terms no less favorable than those offered by Mr. Sarowitz or Blue Marble to its other partners in that market. Pursuant to the terms of the Memorandum, in the event of a sale of a material portion of the business or capital stock of Blue Marble, we have a right of first refusal to buy Blue Marble. Beginning on the third anniversary of the Memorandum, we also have an ongoing option to acquire Blue Marble at fair market value.

● each of our named executive officers;  
● each of our current directors; and 
● all of our current directors and current named executive officers as a group. 
[END TABLE]
Beneficial ownership of shares is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power.
Applicable percentage ownership in the following table is based on 52,796,252 shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2018. Shares of common stock subject to options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of September 30, 2018 and RSU awards vesting within 60 days of September 30, 2018 are deemed to be outstanding for calculating the number and percentage of outstanding shares of the person holding such options and RSU awards, but are not deemed to be outstanding for calculating the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership or voting power representing less than 1% is denoted with an asterisk (*).
Shares shown in the table below include shares held in the beneficial owner's name or jointly with others, or in the name of a bank, nominee or trustee for the beneficial owner's account. Unless otherwise indicated and subject to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each stockholder named in the following table possesses sole voting and investment power over the shares listed, except for those jointly owned with that person's spouse.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock to file initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such person.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("the Dodd-Frank Act"), and Section 14A of the Exchange Act enable our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory or nonbinding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. We currently conduct advisory votes on executive compensation every one year, with the next vote to occur at the 2019 annual meeting.
Our compensation committee and the board of directors believe that our executive compensation program, as described in the section titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and the related narratives and other materials in this Proxy Statement reflects our philosophy of linking the compensation of our executive officers with our performance. Our compensation committee and the board believe that the executive compensation program is reasonable and effective in that it aligns the interests of our executive officers with both the short-term and long-term interests of our stockholders.
This proposal gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation program through the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in the section titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and the related narratives and other materials in this Proxy Statement are hereby approved."
Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the board of directors or our compensation committee. However, our compensation committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when determining future executive compensation arrangements. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. For information on how our compensation committee considered the 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Response to the 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation and Future Advisory Vote".
Vote Required and Board of Directors Recommendation
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter at the annual meeting is required for approval of this proposal. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS OR NOMINATIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT NEXT ANNUAL MEETING
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act of 1934, some stockholder proposals may be eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting. These stockholder proposals must be submitted, along with proof of ownership of our stock in accordance with Rule 14a-8(b) (2), to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on June 25, 2019 (120 days prior to the anniversary of this year's mailing date). Failure to deliver a proposal in accordance with these procedures may result in it not being deemed timely received.
Submitting a stockholder proposal does not guarantee that we will include it in our proxy statement. Our nominating and corporate governance committee reviews all stockholder proposals and makes recommendations to the board for actions on such proposals. For information on qualifications of director nominees considered by our nominating and corporate governance committee, see the "Corporate Governance—Director Nominations" section of this Proxy Statement.
In addition, our Bylaws provide that any stockholder intending to nominate a candidate for election to the board or to propose any business at our 2020 annual meeting, other than non-binding proposals presented pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, must give notice to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day nor later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting as first specified in the notice of meeting (without regard to any postponements or adjournments of such meeting after the notice was first given). The notice must include the information specified in our Bylaws, including information concerning the nominee or proposal, as the case may be, and information concerning the proposing or nominating stockholder's ownership of and agreements related to our stock. If the 2020 annual meeting is held more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary of the date of the 2019 annual meeting, the stockholder must submit notice of any such nomination and of any such proposal that is not made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 by the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 annual meeting or the 10th day following the date on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. We will not entertain any proposals or nominations at the meeting that do not meet the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. If the stockholder does not also comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c)(2) under the Exchange Act, we may exercise discretionary voting under proxies that we solicit to vote in accordance with our best judgment on any stockholder proposal or nomination. To make a submission or request a copy of our Bylaws, stockholders should contact our Corporate Secretary. We strongly encourage stockholders to seek advice from knowledgeable counsel before submitting a proposal or a nomination.

TRANSACTION OF OTHER BUSINESS
At the date of this Proxy Statement, the board of directors knows of no other business that will be conducted at the 2019 annual meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement. If any other matter or matters are properly brought before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME LAST NAME AND ADDRESS
To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to stockholders who may have more than one account holding Paylocity stock but sharing the same address, we have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, certain stockholders of record who have the same address and last name, and who do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials, will receive only one copy of our Proxy Statement and Annual Report and, as applicable, any additional proxy materials that are delivered until such time as one or more of these stockholders notifies us that they want to receive separate copies. This procedure reduces duplicate mailings and saves printing costs and postage fees, as well as natural resources. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions.
If you receive a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding, and you would like to have separate copies of our annual report and other proxy materials mailed to you, please submit a written request to our Corporate Secretary, Paylocity Holding Corporation, 1400 American Lane, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173, or call our Investor Relations department at 847-463-3200, and we will promptly send you what you have requested. You can also contact our Corporate Secretary or Investor Relations department if you received multiple copies of the annual meeting materials and would prefer to receive a single copy in the future, or if you would like to opt out of householding for future mailings.
