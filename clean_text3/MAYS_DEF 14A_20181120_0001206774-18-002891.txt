If you hold shares in "street name", you will receive instructions from your nominee, which you must follow in order to have your proxy authorized or you may contact your nominee directly to request these instructions.

In making such determinations, there were no transactions, relationships or arrangements not disclosed in our SEC filings to be considered by the Board of Directors in determining whether the director was independent.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT
Board Leadership Structure
The current Board Chairman, Lloyd J. Shulman, is also the current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company believes that the Company's current model of the combined Chairman/Chief Executive Officer role is the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time. The combined Chairman/Chief Executive Officer model is a leadership model that has served our shareholders well since the inception of the Company.
The Company believes the combined Chairman/Chief Executive Officer position has certain advantages over other board leadership structures, such as having a non-executive Chairman of the Board. The Company's present structure continues to best meet its current needs, including:
Efficient communication between management and the Board;
Clarity for the Company's shareholders on corporate leadership and accountability; and
The Chairman of the Board possessing the best knowledge of the Company's strategy, operations and financial condition.
Risk Oversight
A fundamental tenet of the Company's risk management process is not only understanding the risks the Company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The entire Board of Directors' involvement in helping to set the Company's business strategy is an important aspect of its assessment of management's tolerance for risk and its determination of the appropriate level of risk for the Company. The Board of Directors oversees investment risk facing the Company by reviewing monthly reports from management of the Company's investments, and at quarterly meetings or more frequently, if needed, of the Company's real estate matters. While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibility for risk management. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk by providing oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls (including working with the Company's independent auditors), as well as the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Company's Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation policies and practices to help ensure there is a closer relationship between compensation levels, on the one hand, and corporate performance and return to shareholders, on the other hand. The Compensation Committee and the full board have reviewed our compensation program and have concluded that it does not encourage excessive risk-taking.
With respect to the Company's compensation plans and programs, the Compensation Committee structures such plans and programs to balance risk and reward, while mitigating the incentive for excessive risk-taking by the Company's executive officers and employees. The Compensation Committee has concluded that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has a Compensation Committee Charter and a Code of Business Conduct which are posted on its website at: www.jwmays.com. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS
The Governance and Nominating Committee has adopted a set of criteria that it considers when it selects individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. First, a candidate must meet the eligibility requirements set forth in the Company's By-Laws. A candidate also must meet independence requirements, if an independent board member is to be appointed, contained in various rules and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and those of the NASDAQ Stock Market and FINRA.
The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the following criteria in selecting nominees for initial election or appointment to the Board: financial, regulatory and business experience; integrity, honesty and reputation; dedication to the Company and its shareholders; independence; and any other factors the Governance and Nominating Committee deems relevant, including age, diversity, size of the Board of Directors and regulatory disclosure obligations. In its consideration of diversity, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to create a Board with a diverse set of skills and experience with respect to management and leadership, vision and strategy, accounting and finance, investing funds, banking, business operations and judgment, and real estate industry knowledge.
In addition, prior to nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board of Directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider and review an existing director's Board and committee attendance and performance; length of Board service; the experience, skills and contributions that the existing director brings to the Board; and independence.
DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS
The process that the Governance and Nominating Committee follows when it identifies and evaluates individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors is as follows: 
For purposes of identifying nominees for the Board of Directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee relies on personal contacts of, and business dealings with, the committee members and other members of the Board of Directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee will also consider director candidates recommended by shareholders in accordance with the policy and procedures set forth below.
In evaluating potential nominees, the Governance and Nominating Committee determines whether the candidate is eligible and qualified for service on the Board of Directors by evaluating the candidate under the selection criteria set forth above. In addition, the Governance and Nominating Committee will review the individual's background and will interview the candidate.
Proposal to Fix the Number of Directors at Seven
Directors are to be elected to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until the election and qualification of their respective successors. The By-Laws provide that, prior to the election of directors at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the number of directors to be elected at such meeting for the ensuing year shall be fixed by the shareholders by a majority vote of the shares represented at the meeting in person or by proxy within the limits fixed by the Certificate of Incorporation which provides for a minimum of three and a maximum of eleven. The Board of Directors recommends the election of seven directors and, except as discussed below, all proxies received pursuant to this solicitation will be voted for that number of directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy is required to fix the number of directors at seven.
Information Concerning Nominees for Election as Directors
It is intended that proxies received pursuant to this solicitation will be voted for the election of the following nominees, unless for any reason any such nominee shall not be available for election, in which event the proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated, and may be voted for substitute nominees in place of those who are not candidates or to reduce (but not below three) the number of directors to be elected. Each of the nominees has consented to serve as a director, if elected, and it is contemplated that all of the nominees will be available for election as directors. There has not been any candidates for directors put forth by shareholders. The following information is given as of September 4, 2018 with respect to each nominee for election as a director. Such information has been furnished by the nominees. The information shows their respective ages, the positions and offices held with the Company, the period served as a director, their relevant business experience, including their principal occupations and employment during that period, their direct beneficial ownership and percentage of the Company's outstanding shares owned [excluding shares which may be deemed to be beneficially owned as set forth under the caption "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" (pages 2 to 5)], and other directorships in public companies. However, none of the directors is a director of another public company.
The name, age, principal occupation, other business affiliations, and certain other information concerning each nominee for election as a director of the Company is set forth below.

COMPENSATION
Overview
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for developing and determining the Company's compensation policies and administering the Company's compensation plans. Additionally, the Compensation Committee determines the compensation to be paid to the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of the Company as well as other key employees (such executives who served during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 are hereinafter referred to as "named executive officers").
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The Compensation Committee considers the ultimate objective of the compensation program to be in the creation of shareholder value. An effective compensation program pursues this objective by (i) aligning each executive officer's interests with those of shareholders by rewarding each executive officer based on the Company's performance and (ii) insuring the Company's continued ability to hire and retain superior employees in key positions by insuring that compensation provided to such employees remains competitive with the compensation paid to employees with similar responsibilities and experience working for companies of comparable size, capitalization, and complexity.
Say-on-Pay and Say-on-Frequency Votes
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the advisory votes taken at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Compensation Committee has taken these votes under advisement.
Determination of Compensation Awards
The Compensation Committee has the primary authority to determine the compensation awards available to the named executive officers other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer (with respect to whom it has sole authority). To assist the Compensation Committee in making such determinations, the Chief Executive Officer conducts an annual performance review with each of the named executive officers other than himself in which each such officer provides the Chief Executive Officer with input about his or her contributions to the Company's business during the given fiscal year. Subsequently, the Chief Executive Officer provides compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding each of such officers.
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of the Chief Executive Officer's performance prior to making its determination. During this review, the Compensation Committee considers the Company's performance in the following categories: the performance of the common stock, the achievement of agreed upon objectives such as increased rental revenues, and other business performance improvements. The Company's management reviews the compensation of all salaried employees on an annual basis, taking into consideration job responsibility, performance and the Company's success. The day-to-day design and administration of health, welfare and paid time-off plans and policies to all employees, other than those employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement, are handled by the Company's management.
The Company does not believe that there are any risks arising from its compensation policies and practices for its employees that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Base Salary
Salary levels for the Company's executive officers are established principally on the basis of the executive's position. In each case, consideration is given both to the personal factors such as the individual's record and the responsibility associated with the position, and the prevailing conditions in the geographic area where the executive's services are performed.
The Compensation Committee recognizes the changing real estate market but believes executive officers' base salaries, as approved by the Board, are at or below competitive base salary levels.
The Compensation Committee in determining future base salary increases, will consider the Company's performance under the then existing conditions and the then competitive conditions in the labor market.
The Company has no incentive compensation programs or stock option plans.
Retirement Plan
The Board of Directors adopted The J. W. Mays, Inc. Retirement Plan and Trust ("Plan") effective August 1, 1991. The Board of Directors believes that the Plan will strengthen the ability of the Company to attract and retain employees (exclusive of those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement) and increase such individuals' incentive to contribute to the Company's future success.
The Company's contribution to the Plan is an amount equal to 15% of each participant's compensation plus 5.7% of each participant's compensation in excess of the contribution and benefit base in effect under Section 230 of the Social Security Act for each year, subject to a compensation limit of $270,000.
Other Benefits
The Company provides the named executive officers with medical insurance, life insurance and disability benefits that are generally made available to the Company's employees to ensure that the Company's employees have access to basic healthcare and income protection for themselves and their family members.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and this Proxy Statement.

Compensation Committee:
POLICY FOR HIRING FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Company has instituted a policy that it will not hire a chief executive officer, controller, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, or any person serving in an equivalent position who was employed by its independent registered public accounting firm and participated in any capacity in the audit of the Company during the one-year period preceding the date of potential hiring.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
As required by the applicable regulations adopted by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering audit committees, the following matters have been complied with by the Audit Committee: The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management. The Audit Committee has discussed with D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301 as such may be modified or supplemented. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP, required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committee), as amended and adopted by the PCAOB Rule 3200T, Communication With Audit Committees. In addition, the Audit Committee has received from the independent auditors the written disclosures required by the PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and has discussed with D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Company and its management. Based upon the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K through incorporation by reference in the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.
The Company is required to file its Audit Committee Charter every three fiscal years. Such Audit Committee Charter is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.
Under the terms of its charter, the Audit Committee approves fees paid by the Company to the independent registered public accounting firm. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Company paid (on a cash basis) the following fees to D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP:
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has considered whether the non-audit services rendered by the independent registered public accounting firm are compatible with an auditor maintaining its independence. The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of such services is compatible with D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP maintaining its independence.
Audit Committee:
The materials referred to above under "Report of the Audit Committee" shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement of incorporation by reference in any filings made under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
BOARD INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
Lloyd J. Shulman, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, serves as an officer and director of Weinstein Enterprises, Inc., which is the beneficial owner of 45.71% of the outstanding common stock of the Company through its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (i) Gailoyd Enterprises Corp., which directly owns 33.79% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and (ii) Celwyn Company, Inc., which directly owns 11.92% of the outstanding common stock of the Company.

Weinstein Foundation, Inc., which is the beneficial owner of 6.97% of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Subject to ratification by the shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, has selected D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm, to examine the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019. This firm first became the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1996. D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP has no direct or indirect financial interest in the Company.
If the selection of D'Arcangelo & Co., LLP is not ratified by the shareholders, or if after ratification, that firm for any reason becomes unable or ineligible to serve, the selection of other independent auditors will be considered by the Audit Committee and the Board. Representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm are expected to be present at the annual meeting with the opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
During fiscal 2018, the Company paid Enterprises total rentals of $987,250 for leases on which two of the Company's real estate properties are located. In the opinion of the Company, the rentals paid to Enterprises are no more favorable than would be payable for comparable properties in arms-length transactions with non-affiliated parties.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and any persons who own more than 10% of the Company's stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of J.W. Mays, Inc. stock with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company believes that during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filings applicable to its executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners affiliated with the Company were timely made.
