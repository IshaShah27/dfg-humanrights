IMPORTANT VOTING INFORMATION
If you hold your shares in "street name," meaning your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you will have received a voting instruction form from that nominee containing instructions that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted. If you do not transmit your voting instructions before the Annual Meeting, your nominee can vote on your behalf only on the matter considered to be routine, which is the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.
The election of directors and advisory vote to approve our executive compensation are NOT considered routine. Your nominee is not permitted to vote on your behalf on such matters unless you provide specific instructions by following the instructions from your nominee about voting your shares. For your vote to be counted on such matters, you will need to communicate your voting decisions to your broker, bank or other nominee before the date of the Annual Meeting.
Your Participation in Voting the Shares You Own is Important
Voting your shares is important to ensure that you have a say in the governance of MGIC Investment Corporation and to fulfill the objectives of the majority voting standard that we apply in the election of directors. Please review the proxy materials and follow the relevant instructions to vote your shares. We hope you will exercise your rights and fully participate as a shareholder in MGIC Investment Corporation.

PROXY SUMMARY
COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS
Pay Mix. A large percentage (88.2%) of our CEO's 2018 total direct compensation is at-risk, performance-based compensation.
CEO 2018 Pay Mix (% of TDC)
At-Risk Performance-Based Pay: 88.2%
Recent Changes.  At our 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, 99% of the Say on Pay votes cast were in support of the compensation of our NEOs. We view these voting results as confirmation of shareholder support of our executive compensation program and made few changes for 2018. However, in response to feedback from an advisor to certain of our shareholders, we reduced the number of metrics used to determine the 2018 bonuses of our NEOs to five from ten in 2017. For more information about this change, see "Components of our Executive Compensation Program – Annual Bonus" in our CD&A.

If you have any questions about attending our Annual Meeting, you can call our Investor Relations personnel at (414) 347-6480.
ABOUT THE MEETING AND PROXY MATERIALS
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?
At our Annual Meeting, shareholders will act on the matters outlined in our notice of meeting preceding the Table of Contents, including election of the twelve directors named in the Proxy Statement, an advisory vote to approve our executive compensation, ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and any other matters that properly come before the meeting. In addition, management will report on our performance during the last year and, after the meeting, respond to questions from shareholders.
Who is entitled to vote at the meeting?
Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2019, the record date for the meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to participate in the Annual Meeting. For each share of Common Stock for which you were shareholder of record on that date, you are entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the meeting. On the record date, 355,925,173 shares of Common Stock were entitled to vote.
What is a proxy?
A proxy is another person you legally designate to vote your shares. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card.
How do I vote my shares?
"Street Name" Holders: If you hold your shares in "street name," meaning your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed or provided a voting instruction form for you to use to direct the broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares. Certain of these institutions offer telephone and online voting.
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  5

[END TABLE]
The plan trustee will vote shares held in your account in accordance with your instructions and the plan terms. The plan trustee may or may not vote the shares for you if your instructions are not received at least three business days before the Annual Meeting date. 
Please contact our Investor Relations personnel at (414) 347-6480 if you would like information about attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. At our meeting, you may be asked to show some form of identification (such as your driver's license).
Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card?
Yes. If you are a shareholder of record, you can revoke your proxy by advising our corporate Secretary in a writing that is received by her at any time before your shares are voted, by granting a new proxy with a later date, or by voting in person at the meeting. If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or nominee, or in our Profit Sharing and Savings Plan, you must follow the instructions of the broker, bank, nominee or plan trustee on how to change your vote.
How are the votes counted?
A quorum is necessary to hold the meeting and will exist if a majority of the 355,925,173 shares of Common Stock entitled to vote as of the record date are represented, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the meeting will be counted by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, which has been appointed by our Board to act as inspector of election for the meeting. All shares voted by proxy are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, including those that abstain or as to which the proxies contain "broker non-votes" as to one or more items.
"Broker non-votes" occur when a broker or other nominee does not vote on a particular matter because the broker or other nominee does not have authority to vote without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and has not 
6 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
ABOUT THE MEETING AND PROXY MATERIALS
received such instructions. Broker non-votes will not be counted as votes for or against any matter. Brokers and other nominees have discretionary authority to vote shares without instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares only for matters considered routine. For the 2018 Annual Meeting, nominees will only have discretionary authority to vote shares on the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm without instructions from the beneficial owner.
What are the Board's recommendations?
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR all of the nominees for director (Item 1), FOR approval of our executive compensation (Item 2), and FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Item 3).
If you sign and return a proxy card or voting instruction form without specifying how you want your shares voted, the named proxies will vote your shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board for all Items and in their best judgment on any other matters that properly come before the meeting.
Will any other items be acted upon at the Annual Meeting?
The Board does not know of any other business to be presented at the Annual Meeting. No shareholder proposals will be presented at this year's Annual Meeting.
What are the deadlines for submission of shareholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting?
Shareholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for shareholder action at future Annual Meetings by following the SEC's rules. Proposals intended for inclusion in next year's proxy materials must be received by our Secretary no later than November 23, 2019.
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"), a shareholder who wants to bring business before the Annual Meeting that has not been included in the proxy materials for the meeting, or who wants to nominate directors at the meeting, must be eligible to vote at the meeting and give written notice of the proposal to our corporate Secretary in accordance with the procedures contained in our Bylaws. For the 2020 Annual Meeting, the notice must be received by the Secretary no later than February 6, 2020, and no earlier than January 12, 2020. For director nominations, the notice must comply with our Bylaws and provide the information required to be included in the Proxy Statement for individuals nominated by our Board. For any other proposals, the notice must describe the proposal and why it should be approved, identify any material interest of the shareholder in the matter, and include other information required by our Bylaws.
Who pays to prepare, mail and solicit the proxies?
We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, our employees may solicit proxies by telephone, email, facsimile or personal interview. We have also engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to provide proxy solicitation services for a fee of $14,000, plus expenses such as charges by brokers, banks and other nominees to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our Common Stock.

MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
The Board of Directors oversees the management of the Company and our business. The Board selects our CEO and in conjunction with our CEO selects the rest of our senior management team, which is responsible for operating our business.
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which set forth a framework for our governance. The Guidelines cover the Board's composition, leadership, meeting process, director independence, Board membership criteria, committee structure, succession planning and director compensation. Among other things, the Board meets in executive session outside the presence of any member of our management after at least two Board meetings annually at which directors are present in person and at any additional times determined by the Board or the Lead Director. Mr. Jastrow presides at these sessions and has served as the Board's Lead Director since the position was created in October 2009. See " — Board Leadership" for information about the Lead Director's responsibilities and authority. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director shall not be nominated by the Board for re‑election if at the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the director is age 74 or more. The Board (other than Ms. Carr, who abstained) determined that the age limit be waived for Ms. Carr for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in light of Ms. Carr's continuing contributions to the Board. The Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that a director who retires from his principal employment or joins a new employer shall offer to resign from the Board. Unless the Board determines that a Chief Executive Officer who is Chairman of the Board should continue as Chairman of the Board after his or her tenure as Chief Executive Officer, a director who is an officer of the Company or a subsidiary and leaves the Company shall resign from the Board. In 2014, the Board determined that Mr. Culver should become non-executive Chairman of the Board upon retirement from his position as Chief Executive Officer in 2015.
We have a Code of Business Conduct emphasizing our commitment to conducting our business in accordance with legal requirements and high ethical standards. The Code applies to all employees, including our executive officers, and specified portions are applicable to our directors. Certain portions of the Code that apply to transactions with our executive officers, directors, and their immediate family members are described under "Other Matters – Related Person Transactions" below. These descriptions are subject to the actual terms of the Code.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct are available on our website (http://mtg.mgic.com) under the "Leadership & Governance; Documents" links. Written copies of these documents are available to any shareholder who submits a written request to our Secretary. We intend to disclose on our website any waivers from, or amendments to, our Code of Business Conduct that are subject to disclosure under applicable rules and regulations.
Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines regarding director independence provide that a director is not independent if the director has any specified disqualifying relationship with us. The disqualifying relationships are equivalent to those of the independence rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), except that our disqualification for board interlocks is more stringent than under the NYSE rules. Also, for a director to be independent under the Guidelines, the director may not have any material relationship with us. For purposes of determining whether a disqualifying or material relationship exists, we consider relationships with MGIC Investment Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Board has determined that all of our directors except for Mr. Culver, our former CEO, and Mr. Sinks, our current CEO, are independent under the Guidelines and the NYSE rules. The Board made its independence determinations by considering whether any disqualifying relationships existed during the periods specified under the Guidelines and the NYSE rules. To determine that there were no material relationships, the Board applied categorical standards that it had adopted and incorporated into our Corporate Governance Guidelines. All independent directors met these standards. 
10 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
Under these standards, a director is not independent if payments under transactions between us and a company of which the director is an executive officer or 10% or greater owner exceeded the greater of $1 million or 1% of the other company's gross revenues. Payments made to and payments made by us are considered separately, and this quantitative threshold is applied to transactions that occurred in the three most recent fiscal years of the other company. Also under these standards, a director is not independent if during our last three fiscal years the director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• was an executive officer of a charity to which we made contributions, or 
• was an executive officer or member of a law firm or investment banking firm providing services to us, or 
• received any direct compensation from us other than as a director, or if during such period a member of the director's immediate family received compensation from us. 
[END TABLE]
In making its independence determinations, the Board considered payments we made to Moody's Analytics (of which Dr. Zandi is an executive officer) for research and subscription services for Moody's Economy.com and related publications, and payments to Moody's Investors Service for credit rating services. These transactions were below the quantitative threshold contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and were entered into in the ordinary course of business by us, Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investors Service.
Board Leadership
Mr. Culver serves as non-executive Chairman of the Board and Mr. Jastrow serves as Lead Director. Under this structure, the Chairman chairs Board meetings, where the Board discussion includes strategic and business issues. The Board believes that this approach makes sense at this time because Mr. Culver, as our former CEO, is very familiar with our business and strategic plans as reviewed by the Board. Mr. Culver has been with us since 1985, and served as Chief Executive Officer from 2000 until his retirement in 2015, when he became our non-executive Chairman of the Board.
Because the Board also believes that strong, independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance, the Board maintains the position of Lead Director. The Lead Director is an independent director selected by the independent directors. Mr. Jastrow has served as the Lead Director since the position was established in 2009. The Lead Director's responsibilities and authority include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present; 
• having the authority to call and lead executive sessions of directors without the presence of any director who is an officer (or if determined by the Board, a former officer) (the Board meets in executive session after at least two Board meetings each year); 
• serving as a conduit between the CEO and the independent directors to the extent requested by the independent directors; 
• serving as a conduit for the Board's informational needs, including proposing topics for Board meeting agendas; and 
• being available, if requested by major shareholders, for consultation and communication. 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that a leader intimately familiar with our business and strategic plans serving as Chairman, together with an experienced and engaged Lead Director, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Board at this time. The Board reviews periodically the structure of the Board and the Board's leadership.
Communicating with the Board
Shareholders and other interested persons can communicate with members of the Board, non-management members of the Board as a group or the Lead Director, by sending a written communication to our Secretary, addressed to: MGIC Investment Corporation, Secretary, P.O. Box 488, Milwaukee, WI 53201. The Secretary will pass along any such communication, other than a solicitation for a product or service, to the Lead Director.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
Director Selection
The Board believes that the Board, as a whole, should possess a combination of skills, professional experience, and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee our business. In addition, the Board believes there are certain attributes every director should possess, as reflected in the Board's membership criteria. Accordingly, the Board and the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and our current and future needs.
The Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for developing Board membership criteria and recommending these criteria to the Board. The criteria, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, include an inquiring and independent mind, sound and considered judgment, high standards of ethical conduct and integrity, well-respected experience at senior levels of business, academia, government or other fields, ability to commit sufficient time and attention to Board activities, anticipated tenure on the Board, and whether an individual will enable the Board to continue to have a substantial majority of independent directors. In addition, the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee in conjunction with the Board periodically evaluates the composition of the Board to assess the skills and experience that are currently represented on the Board, as well as the skills and experience that the Board will find valuable in the future. The Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee seeks a variety of occupational and personal backgrounds on the Board in order to obtain a range of viewpoints and perspectives and enable the Board to have access to a diverse body of talent and expertise relevant to our activities. The Committee's and the Board's evaluation of the Board's composition enables the Board to consider the skills and experience it seeks in the Board as a whole, and in individual directors, as our needs evolve and change over time and to assess the effectiveness of the Board's efforts at pursuing diversity. In identifying director candidates from time to time, the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee may establish specific skills and experience that it believes we should seek in order to constitute a balanced and effective board.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
The Board of Directors held five meetings and one informal update session during 2018. Each director serving in 2018 attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees of the Board on which he or she served.

COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS
Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee
The Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program, including approving corporate goals relating to compensation for our CEO, determining our CEO's annual compensation and approving compensation for our other senior executives. The Committee prepares the Compensation Committee Report and reviews the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in our Proxy Statement. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of directors. The Committee may delegate its responsibilities to subcommittees of the Committee.
The Committee receives information that includes: detailed breakdowns of the compensation of the NEOs, the amount, if any, that our NEOs realized in at least the previous five years pursuant to sales of shares awarded under equity grants; the total amount of stock and RSUs held by each NEO (RSUs are sometimes referred to in this Proxy Statement as "restricted equity"); and the other compensation information disclosed in this Proxy Statement under the SEC's rules. The Committee supports the Board's role in overseeing the risks facing the Company, as described in more detail below under "Board Oversight of Risk."
The Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co. (the "Compensation Consultant"), a nationally recognized executive compensation consulting firm, to advise it. The Committee retains the Compensation Consultant to, among other things, help it evaluate and oversee our executive compensation program and review the compensation of our directors. The scope of the Compensation Consultant's services during 2018 is described under "Role of the Compensation Consultant" in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis below. In providing its services to the Committee, the Compensation Consultant regularly interacts with our senior management. The Compensation Consultant does not provide any services to us, other than the consulting services noted above. The Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that its work for the Committee does not raise any conflict of interest.
The Committee also evaluates the annual performance of the CEO, oversees the CEO succession planning process, and makes recommendations to the Board to fill open director and committee member positions. In addition, the Committee reviews our Corporate Governance Guidelines and oversees the Board's self-evaluation process. Finally, the Committee identifies new director candidates through recommendations from Committee members, other Board members and our executive officers, and will consider candidates who are recommended by shareholders.
Shareholders may recommend a director candidate for consideration by the Committee by submitting background information about the candidate, a description of his or her qualifications and the candidate's consent to being recommended as a candidate. If the candidate is to be considered for nomination at the next annual shareholders meeting, the submission must be received by our corporate Secretary in writing no later than November 23, 2019. Information on shareholder nominations is provided under "About the Meeting and Proxy Materials" in response to the question "What are the deadlines for submission of shareholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting?"
The Committee evaluates new director candidates under the criteria described under "Director Selection" as well as other factors the Committee deems relevant, through background reviews, input from other members of the Board and our executive officers, and personal interviews with the candidates attended by at least the Committee Chair. The Committee will evaluate any director candidates recommended by shareholders using the same process and criteria that apply to candidates from other sources.
All members of the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee meet the heightened independence criteria that apply to compensation committee members under SEC and NYSE rules.
Risk Management Committee 
The Risk Management Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Company's enterprise risk management framework, including the Company's risk appetite on an enterprise-wide basis, and in overseeing certain key risks, including mortgage

credit risk. In connection with its oversight of mortgage credit risk, the Committee monitors the performance of the Company's insured books of business and the principal factors affecting their performance; it discusses the Company's products, including premium rates, returns, underwriting guidelines and quality controls, and external reinsurance programs; and it reviews the insurance operating environment, including the state of local and regional housing markets, competitive forces affecting the Company, the Company's relationships with residential mortgage lenders and mortgage investors, regulatory and GSE capital requirements, and lender, GSE and government programs. The Risk Management Committee supports the Board's role in overseeing other risks facing the Company, as described in more detail below under "Board Oversight of Risk."
Securities Investment Committee
The Securities Investment Committee oversees management of our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of the Company's employee benefit plans by those persons (employees of the Company or external asset managers) who are managing such assets on a day-to-day basis. The Committee also makes recommendations to the Board with respect to our retirement benefit plans that are available to employees generally, capital management (other than external reinsurance), including repurchase of common stock and debt, and external funding. Finally, the Committee supports the Board's role in overseeing the risks facing the Company, as described in more detail below under "Board Oversight of Risk."
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee provides an alternative to convening a meeting of the entire Board should a matter arise between Board meetings that requires Board authorization. The Committee is established under our Bylaws and has all authority that the Board may exercise with the exception of certain matters that under the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law are reserved to the Board itself.
Board Oversight of Risk 
Our senior management is charged with identifying and managing the risks facing our business and operations. The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of how our senior management addresses these risks to the extent they are material. In this regard, the Board seeks to understand the material risks we face and to allocate, among the full Board and its committees, responsibilities for overseeing how management addresses the risks, including the risk management systems and processes that management uses for this purpose. Overseeing risk is an ongoing process. Accordingly, the Board periodically considers risk throughout the year and also with respect to specific proposed actions.
The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through delegation to various committees. These committees meet regularly and report back to the full Board. The following four committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates the incentives and risks associated with our compensation philosophy and programs, and oversees operational risks related to human resources. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Risk Management Committee assists the Board in overseeing the Company's enterprise risk management framework, including the Company's risk appetite on an enterprise-wide basis, and in overseeing the following key Company risks: Mortgage Credit; Capital Risk related to the required amount of capital; non-Investment Portfolio Counterparty Risk; Model Risk; Operational Risk related to Underwriting, Servicing, Claims, Risk and Sales; and Macroeconomic Business Risk.

• The Securities Investment Committee oversees risks related to our investment portfolio and capital management, which includes Market Risk; Investment Portfolio Counterparty Risk; Capital Risk related to our capital structure, access to capital and credit rating; and Liquidity Risk.

• The Audit Committee oversees our processes for assessing risks (other than risks overseen by other committees) and the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. In performing this function, the Audit Committee considers information from our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors and discusses relevant issues with management, the Internal Audit Director and the independent registered public accounting firm.  The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing Compliance Risk; Cybersecurity Risk; and Operational Risk related to Information Systems, Finance and Legal matters. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with the Chief Risk Officer and the Chairman of the Risk Management Committee to discuss and review in a general manner the Risk Management Committee's oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management framework. 
[END TABLE]
We believe that our leadership structure, discussed in "Board Leadership" above, supports the risk oversight function of the Board. Our former CEO serves as Chairman of the Board and has a wealth of experience with the risks of our Company and industry. Our current CEO is a director who keeps the Board informed about the risks we face. In addition, independent directors chair the various committees involved with risk oversight and there is open communication between senior management and directors.

ITEM 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Item 1 consists of the election of directors. The Board, upon the recommendation of the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee, has nominated Daniel A. Arrigoni, Cassandra C. Carr, C. Edward Chaplin, Curt S. Culver, Timothy A. Holt, Kenneth M. Jastrow, II, Jodeen A. Kozlak, Michael E. Lehman, Melissa B. Lora, Gary A. Poliner, Patrick Sinks and Mark M. Zandi for re-election to the Board to serve until our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If any nominee is not available for election, proxies will be voted for another person nominated by the Board or the size of the Board will be reduced.
Shareholder Vote Required
Our Articles of Incorporation contain a majority vote standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections. Under this standard, each of the twelve nominees must receive a "majority vote" at the meeting to be elected a director. A "majority vote" means that when there is a quorum present, more than 50% of the votes cast in the election of the director are cast "for" the director, with votes cast being equal to the total of the votes "for" the election of the director plus the votes "withheld" from the election of the director. Therefore, under our Articles of Incorporation, a "withheld" vote is effectively a vote "against" a nominee. Broker non-votes will be disregarded in the calculation of a "majority vote." Any incumbent director who does not receive a majority vote (but whose term as a director nevertheless would continue under Wisconsin law until his successor is elected) is required to send our Board a resignation. The effectiveness of any such resignation is contingent upon Board acceptance. The Board will accept or reject a resignation in its discretion after receiving a recommendation made by our Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee and will promptly publicly disclose its decision regarding the director's resignation (including the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation, if applicable).
[BEGIN TABLE]
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR EACH OF THE TWELVE NOMINEES. SIGNED PROXY CARDS AND VOTING INSTRUCTION FORMS WILL BE VOTED FOR THE NOMINEES UNLESS A SHAREHOLDER GIVES OTHER INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PROXY CARD OR VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Non-Employee Director Compensation Program 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, compensation of non-employee directors is reviewed periodically by the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee. Mr. Sinks is our CEO and receives no additional compensation for service as a director, and he is not eligible to participate in any of the following programs or plans.
The following table describes the components of the non-employee director compensation program in effect during 2018.

Annual Retainer – Equity   $100,000 in cash-settled RSUs that vest immediately but are not settled for approximately one year. Such settlement may be deferred at the option of the director. 
Annual Retainer – Lead Director   $25,000

Expense Reimbursement   Subject to certain limits, we reimburse directors, and for meetings not held on our premises, their spouses, for travel, lodging and related expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and Committee meetings. 
Directors & Officers Insurance   We pay premiums for D&O liability insurance under which the directors are insureds. 
(1)  Excludes the Executive Committee. Other than the Executive Committee, directors who are members of management do not serve on any committees but may attend committee meetings. 
(2)  After a non-management director attends five Board meetings in a given year, he or she is paid $5,000 for each subsequent Board meeting attended in that year. After a non-management director attends five meetings of a particular committee in a given year, he or she is paid $3,000 for each subsequent meeting of that committee attended in that year. However, directors are paid for attendance at only one committee meeting on any given day, regardless of the number of meetings attended on that day. Meetings of the Board of MGIC (or Committees of its Board) that are not held in conjunction with meetings of the Board of the Company (or Committees of its Board) are counted to determine meeting fees. 
(3)  Each of our non-employee directors satisfies this guideline. 
[END TABLE]
Deferred Compensation Plan and Annual Grant of Share Units:  Under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"), our non-employee directors can elect to defer payment of all or part of their retainers and meeting fees until the director's death, disability, termination of service as a director or to another date specified by the director. A director who elects to defer payments may have his or her deferred compensation bookkeeping account credited quarterly with interest accrued at an annual rate equal to the six-month U.S. Treasury Bill rate determined 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  25
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
at the closest preceding January 1 and July 1 of each year, or may elect to have the payments deferred during a quarter translated into share units. Each share unit is equal in value to one share of our Common Stock and is ultimately settled only in cash. Such payment will be based on the stock's average closing price for the five consecutive trading days preceding the payment date(s). If a director defers payments into share units, dividend equivalents in the form of additional share units are credited to the director's account as of the date of payment of cash dividends on our Common Stock. We have not paid dividends since 2008.
Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, we also provide to each director an annual equity retainer, which is a grant of cash-settled share units. In January 2018, each of our non-management directors was granted share units valued at $100,000, which vested immediately and were settled on February 15, 2019, unless the director elected a later settlement date.  The directors could elect to receive payment for vested units in up to ten annual installments beginning shortly after departure from the Board, or on another date specified by the director that was after February 15, 2019.  In all cases, the payment was or will be based on the stock's average closing price for the five consecutive trading days preceding the payment date(s).  Dividend equivalents in the form of additional share units are credited to the director's account as of the date of payment of cash dividends on our Common Stock. 
2018 Director Compensation

ITEM 2 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
At our 2017 Annual Meeting, we held a non-binding, advisory shareholder vote on the frequency of future advisory shareholder votes on the compensation of our NEOs. Our shareholders expressed a preference that advisory shareholder votes on the compensation of our NEOs be held on an annual basis and, as previously disclosed, the Company continued the policy to hold such votes annually.  Accordingly, as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are asking shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed under the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, the compensation tables and any related material contained in this Proxy Statement.
We strongly believe you should approve our compensation in light of the factors discussed in the Executive Summary to the CD&A.
While this vote is advisory and is not binding, the Board and the Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding compensation of our NEOs. See "Investor Outreach and Consideration of Last Year's 'Say on Pay' Vote" in the Executive Summary to our CD&A.
Shareholder Vote Required
Approval of the compensation of our NEOs requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Key Takeaways
Our 2018 financial and business performance was outstanding
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted net operating income per diluted share for 2018 was $1.78, up 31% from 2017 ($1.36), with adjusted net operating income of $668.7 million, up 29% from 2017 ($517.7 million).(1)  Adjusted net operating income was a component of ROE, one of the financial performance measures that determined payouts under our 2018 annual bonus program, as described below under "Components of our Executive Compensation Program – Annual Bonus." 
• ROE for 2018 was 20.9%, up from 19.7% in 2017. For purposes of our 2018 bonus program, ROE is calculated as adjusted net operating income, divided by beginning shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).(1) 
• Aided in part by our new insurance written, our book of direct primary insurance in force, the principal source of our future revenue, grew by approximately 8% in 2018. New insurance written was one of the financial metrics that determined payouts under our 2018 bonus program. 
• Our book value per share grew by more than 18% in 2018.

[END TABLE]
The 2018 performance-based compensation we awarded to our NEOs was aligned with shareholder interests 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Annual Bonus. Our NEOs' 2018 bonuses depended on performance against five performance metrics; each of those metrics was tied to our business strategies and aligned with shareholder interests. 
  ○ The following two financial performance metrics had a total weight of 75% in determining the bonuses: 
    ■ Return on Equity(1) had a weight of 45%.  Full credit under the bonus calculation required a 17% ROE. 
    ■ New Insurance Written had a weight of 30%. NIW received credit under the bonus calculation only if its expected risk-adjusted return on capital exceeded the Company's hurdle rate. 
  ○ Three business performance objectives, discussed in more detail under "Components of our Executive Compensation Program — Bonus," had a total weight of 25%. Each business performance objective is directly related to our business strategies and strong performance against each objective is expected to lead to an increase in shareholder value over the long-term. 
● Long-Term Equity Awards. Our long-term equity awards: 
  ○ Promote a long-term focus because cliff vesting occurs only after three years for the CEO and all EVPs. 
  ○ Are aligned with shareholder interests because they are 100% performance-based (no time vesting only) and require the Company to achieve a 16.4% compound annual growth in adjusted book value per share for full vesting.(1) 
● Performance-Based Compensation for our CEO accounted for 88.2% of his TDC in 2018 and, on average, accounted for 83.9% of the TDC of all other current NEOs. 
(1) For purposes of the bonus calculation, ROE is calculated as adjusted net operating income divided by beginning shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Adjusted net operating income and adjusted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS — Shareholder Outreach
Shareholder Outreach and Consideration of Last Year's "Say on Pay" Vote
During late 2018 and early 2019, we continued our shareholder outreach efforts, as shown in the chart below. Important topics of our shareholder outreach meetings included performance against our business strategies; our executive compensation program; board oversight of risk; and environmental, social and governance matters. Important topics of the prior year's shareholder outreach meetings included our executive compensation program, our shareholder rights agreement, and governance matters. Nearly all of the changes we have recently made to our executive compensation program were in response to feedback received from our shareholders and their advisors. We value the views of our shareholders and intend to continue to engage with them and solicit their feedback.
At each of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, 99% of the Say on Pay votes cast were in support of the compensation of our NEOs. The Committee views these voting results as confirmation of shareholder support of our executive compensation program.  
Compensation-Related Corporate Governance Policies and Best Practices
We have many compensation-related governance policies and best practices that we believe align our executive compensation with shareholder interests:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Stock Ownership Guidelines è Our stock ownership guidelines require our CEO to own Company stock equal in value to at least six times his base salary, and require our other NEOs to own Company stock equal in value to at least three times their base salaries. 
Post-Vesting Stock Holding Requirementsè Our NEOs and other executive officers are required to hold, for one year after vesting, the lower of 25% of shares that vest under equity awards and 50% of the shares that were received by the officer after taking account of shares withheld to cover taxes. Apart from what is required, we have had a culture of stock retention by senior executives. Excluding shares withheld from equity awards for income tax withholding, the last time any of our current NEOs sold our stock while an NEO was more than 12 years ago. 
Post-Vesting Stock Holding Requirementsè Our NEOs and other executive officers are required to hold, for one year after vesting, the lower of 25% of shares that vest under equity awards and 50% of the shares that were received by the officer after taking account of shares withheld to cover taxes. Apart from what is required, we have had a culture of stock retention by senior executives. Excluding shares withheld from equity awards for income tax withholding, the last time any of our current NEOs sold our stock while an NEO was more than 12 years ago. 
No Hedging, Pledging or 10b5-1 Plansè Our policies prohibit directors, NEOs and other officers from entering into hedging transactions referencing the Company's equity securities, holding Company securities in a margin account, or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. They also prohibit the use by those individuals of plans created pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act which may otherwise have allowed such persons to sell our stock while in possession of material non-public information about us. 
High Percentage of Performance-Based Compensation è 88% of our CEO's 2018 TDC is tied to achievement of pre‑set performance goals, with 64% of such 88% based on long-term performance over a three-year performance period.

Governance Policies and Best Practices — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
[BEGIN TABLE]
Limited Perquisites è Our perquisites are very modest, ranging between approximately $800 and $6,400 in 2018 for our current NEOs. 
Effective Use of Equity Compensation with Low Burn Rate and Dilutionè The total equity awards granted to all participants under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan in each of January 2018 and January 2019 represented approximately 0.5% of our outstanding shares at the prior December 31. The Company had the lowest dilution from outstanding awards among all companies in the Benchmarking Peer Group (calculated as outstanding equity awards on December 31, 2018, as a percentage of weighted average total shares outstanding). Based on a "burn rate" methodology that uses the average of the total awards granted (after applying a multiple of 2.5 for RSUs vs. options) and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each of the last three completed years, our three-year average annual "burn rate" for 2016-2018 is approximately 1.2%.

Limited Change in Control Benefits è "Double trigger" is generally required for any benefits to be paid. Equity awards may vest upon a change in control only if the Committee determines that the awards will not be assumed or replaced. Cash severance does not exceed 2 times base salary plus bonus plus retirement plan accrual. There is no excise tax gross-up provision.

OBJECTIVES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
In setting compensation, the Committee focuses on Total Direct Compensation (TDC). The objectives of our executive compensation program are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain high-quality executives. We want a competitive pay opportunity that provides for: 
◦ base salaries that are near the median of our Benchmarking Peers, and  
◦ bonus and long-term equity awards that, when performance is strong, move TDC above the median of our Benchmarking Peers to motivate and reward strong performance. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align executive compensation with long-term shareholder interests. We align compensation and long-term shareholder interests by: 
◦ linking executive compensation to Company and executive performance; and  
◦ paying a substantial portion of TDC in: 
§ bonuses that are at-risk and are based on specific goals that align payouts with Company performance, with quantitative financial metrics accounting for 75% of the bonus calculation; and  
§ long-term equity awards, with vesting based on a three-year quantitative performance goal that aligns payouts with Company performance and whose value directly reflects our stock price.  
[END TABLE]
HOW WE MAKE COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
Role of the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the development and administration of our executive compensation program. The Committee approves the compensation of our CEO and our other senior executives, and performs other tasks including:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing and approving bonus and equity compensation goals and objectives; 
• Evaluating performance in light of these goals and objectives; and 
• Evaluating the competitiveness of the CEO's total compensation package. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee also supports the Board's role in overseeing the risks facing the Company, as described in more detail above under "Committee Membership and Meetings — Board Oversight of Risk."
The Committee is supported in its work by our CEO, our Chief Human Resources Officer, our General Counsel and the Committee's Compensation Consultant, as described below. Our Chairman of the Board, who was previously our CEO but now is not a member of our management, regularly participates in meetings of the Committee.
Role of the Compensation Consultant
The Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., a nationally recognized executive compensation consulting firm, to advise it. While our Chief Human Resources Officer coordinates its assignments, the Compensation Consultant reports directly to the Committee; the Committee retains authority to approve the compensation of the Compensation Consultant, determine the nature and scope of its services and evaluate its performance. The Compensation Consultant provides no services to the Company other than the consulting services to the Committee regarding executive compensation and non-executive director compensation. The Committee may replace the Compensation Consultant or hire additional 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  33
How We Make Compensation Decisions — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
consultants at any time. A representative of the Compensation Consultant attends meetings of the Committee, as requested. 
The Committee retains the Compensation Consultant to help it evaluate and oversee our executive compensation program and to periodically review the compensation of our directors. In connection with our executive compensation program, the Compensation Consultant provides various services to the Committee, including advising the Committee on the principal aspects of our executive compensation program and evolving industry practices and providing market information and analysis regarding the competitiveness of our program, including its relationship to performance. 
The Compensation Consultant's work for the Committee during 2018 and early 2019 included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An evaluation of NEO compensation compared to Benchmarking Peers; 
• Advice about the annual bonus plan, including the goals and target performance incorporated into the formula that is used to determine payouts; 
• Advice about the long-term equity incentive program, including the level of awards granted under the program and the vesting provisions; 
• Advice regarding "best practice" compensation practices; 
• Analysis of our peer group used to evaluate our executive compensation; 
• Simulations of quantitative pay-for-performance models and review of policy statements of a leading proxy governance firm; 
• An evaluation of the costs of change in control benefits for executives; 
• Review of drafts of the CD&A and related compensation tables for the Proxy Statement; and 
• An evaluation of compensation for the non-employee directors compared to our Benchmarking Peers. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to SEC and New York Stock Exchange rules and concluded that its work for the Committee does not raise any conflict of interest.
Role of Officers 
While the Committee is ultimately responsible for making all compensation decisions affecting our NEOs, our CEO participates in the process because the Committee views his input as necessary given his close day-to-day association with the other NEOs and his knowledge of our operations. Among other things, our CEO makes recommendations on the components of compensation for the NEOs, other than himself. Our CEO does not participate in the portions of Committee meetings regarding the review of his own performance or the determination of the amounts of his compensation or when the Committee members meet among themselves. 
Our Chief Human Resources Officer and our General Counsel also participate in the Committee's compensation process. Our Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for coordinating the work of the Compensation Consultant for the Committee and the annual preparation of an executive compensation risk evaluation. He maintains knowledge of executive compensation trends, practices, rules and regulations and works with our General Counsel on related legal and tax compliance matters as well as on other matters related to executive compensation. The Committee receives information from management that includes: detailed breakdowns of the compensation of the NEOs; the amount, if any, that our NEOs realized during the period they were NEOs from sales of stock received upon vesting of equity awards; the total amount of stock and RSUs held by each NEO; and the other compensation information disclosed in this Proxy Statement.
34 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
BENCHMARKING
To provide the Committee with a framework for evaluating compensation levels for our NEOs against market practices, the Compensation Consultant periodically prepares reports analyzing compensation data for our Benchmarking Peers. In addition, each year we provide the Committee with information regarding market trends and expected executive base salary changes for the coming year. The compensation surveys that we reviewed and, with the concurrence of the Compensation Consultant, summarized in the aggregate for the Committee in connection with establishing base salaries for 2018 were published by AON Hewitt, Mercer Consulting, Willis Towers Watson and World at Work. 
Recent Changes to our Peer Group 
The U.S. mortgage insurance industry has only six public companies. Therefore, the Committee has found it necessary to include companies from outside the mortgage insurance industry when constructing our group of Benchmarking Peers. Historically, surety and title insurers have been included because, like mortgage insurers, they have significant exposure to the residential real estate market.
2017 Changes. While shareholders have not expressed concern with our Benchmarking Peer Group during our outreach meetings, the Committee periodically reviews the composition of the group. In 2017, the Committee added four companies to the group for several reasons, including the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size of the Group.  Due to the limited number of public companies in the mortgage, surety and title insurance industries, our 2016 peer group of ten companies was smaller than the peer groups of many other companies. In addition, the number was expected to decrease as one of the Benchmarking Peers had agreed to be acquired by a non-public company (that transaction remained pending as of December 31, 2018), and two of the other Benchmarking Peers have significantly decreased in size since 2008 as a result of the financial crisis. Because of the relatively small peer group size and the prospect of it becoming smaller, the Committee chose to increase the size of our peer group. 
• Composition of the Group.  As noted above, our Benchmarking Peer Group had historically been composed of companies in the mortgage, surety and title insurance industries. However, recent talent acquisition has been from outside those industries; one of our NEOs and several of the officers we have most recently hired joined us from banking and mortgage finance companies. Therefore, the Committee determined that those industries should be represented in our peer group. In determining the companies to be added to our peer group, the Committee also considered which companies chose us as a peer; three of the four companies added chose us as a peer. 
[END TABLE]
2018 Changes. Two of our peers merged in 2018, decreasing the size of our peer group to thirteen companies. At the recommendation of the Compensation Consultant, the Committee chose to not add additional companies to our peer group for purposes of benchmarking 2019 executive compensation. 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │ Benchmarking — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

Why we do not include property and casualty insurers in our Benchmarking Peer Group 
A leading proxy advisory service compares our CEO's compensation to the compensation of CEOs in a peer group that it constructs for us. That peer group includes a number of property and casualty insurers. We do not include property and casualty insurers in our Benchmarking Peer Group because those companies: (1) are not subject to residential mortgage risk or the residential real estate market to the same extent as are we or our Benchmarking Peers, (2) are not the companies with which we compete for executive talent, and (3) do not select us as a benchmarking peer. In addition, we do not believe comparing us to that peer group is appropriate because we are generally larger in market capitalization and revenues: as of December 31, 2018, our market capitalization was in the 96th percentile of the constructed peer group and our revenues were in the 69th percentile of that group. 
36 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPONENTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Each of the components of our executive compensation is discussed below. To meet our objective of aligning compensation and shareholder interests, our executive compensation program includes an annual bonus program that is tied to Company performance, and long-term equity awards with vesting tied to Company performance and whose ultimate value reflects our stock price. As shown in the chart below, a large percentage (88.2%) of our CEO's TDC is at-risk through the annual bonus and long-term equity awards.
CEO 2018 Pay Mix (% of TDC)
At-Risk Performance-Based Pay: 88.2%
Base Salary
Our general philosophy is to target base salary range midpoints for our executive officers near the median levels of their Benchmarking Peer Group counterparts. In considering any change to our CEO's compensation, including base salary, the Committee takes into account market competitiveness and its evaluation of his performance.  Such evaluation is based in part on a CEO evaluation survey completed by each non-management director. Subjects covered by the evaluation include financial results, leadership, strategic planning, succession planning, community and industry involvement, and communications and relations with the Board. Base salary changes for our other NEOs are recommended to the Committee by the CEO based on his evaluation of each NEO's performance and the base salary surveys referred to under "Benchmarking" above. The Committee approves changes in salaries for NEOs after taking into account the CEO's recommendations and the Committee's independent judgment regarding the NEO gained through the Committee's general contact with them, including contact through Board meetings.
In early April 2018, each current NEO received a merit salary increase of 3%. 
Annual Bonus
The structure of our current bonus program, which has financial goals and business objectives, has been in effect since 2015, subject to minor adjustments. For 2018, we reduced the number of metrics to determine bonuses to five from the ten used in 2017. Feedback from an advisor to several of our shareholders suggested that ten metrics was a relatively large number that added complexity to the program and had the possibility of insulating pay from poor performance in any single metric.
Maximum Bonus Opportunity.  Unchanged from 2017, the maximum bonus opportunities for 2018 were 3 times base salary for the CEO and 2.25 times base salary for the other NEOs. Bonus opportunity represents a multiple of the base salary amount approved by the Committee in January that becomes effective in March or April of the year for which the bonuses are awarded. Such base salary amounts will not be the same as the base salary amounts disclosed in the SCT 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  37
Components —  Annual Bonus — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
due to the effects of the March or April pay increases and variability in the number of pay periods in each calendar year. Based on our periodic assessment of our Benchmarking Peer Group, we have determined that these maximum bonus opportunities are appropriate to meet our objective that, when performance is strong, our bonus and long-term equity awards should move TDC above the median of our Benchmarking Peer Group to motivate and reward strong performance. In addition, in determining the TDC opportunity, the Committee has weighted bonus opportunities more heavily than base salaries because bonuses are more directly linked to Company performance. 
As shown in the table below, our CEO's maximum bonus opportunity is in line with our Benchmarking Peers' practices. In October 2018, the Compensation Consultant provided a report including the following comparative data showing how our CEO's 2017 maximum bonus opportunity, as a percentage of base salary, compares to the 2017 maximum bonus opportunities of the CEOs in our Benchmarking Peer Group. Comparisons for 2017 are shown because this compensation data was the latest available when the report was provided by the Compensation Consultant.

Calculation of 2018 Bonus.  As shown in the table below, the bonus formula for 2018 had two financial performance goals (with a total weight of 75%) and three business objectives (with a total weight of 25%). Threshold, target and maximum performance levels were established for each financial performance goal. Actual performance at such levels would result in 0%, 50% and 100% achievement, respectively, for that goal, with actual achievement between these levels calculated by interpolation. The percentages determined by the Company's actual 2018 performance for each financial performance goal were multiplied by assigned weights to determine a weighted score for that goal. For the business objectives, the Committee reviewed management's written report of the Company's activities with respect to each objective and the related score, which was accepted by the Committee.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS — Components —  Annual Bonus
The aggregate weighted financial and business performance scores resulted in a preliminary bonus percentage of 90.3%. The Committee has discretion to adjust the preliminary bonus percentage up or down by as much as 10 percentage points, but did not do so. The bonus percentage was multiplied by the aggregate maximum bonuses of the current NEOs to determine the amount of the total bonus pool, which the Committee is not required to allocate in full; it allocated the pool such that the CEO received 88% of his maximum bonus and the other current NEOs received an average of 90% of their maximum bonuses. Mr. Lane was awarded a bonus upon his retirement, based on the then-forecasted 2018 bonus percentage (85%), pro-rated for his employment period in 2018. The CEO recommends to the Committee a bonus for each of the other NEOs, which takes into account the bonus formula and the CEO's evaluation of the NEO's performance. The Committee, which has regular contact with the NEOs through their interaction with the Board, accepted the CEO's recommendation and approved bonuses for the other NEOs.

Setting Our Financial Performance Goals.  The Committee chose return on equity and new insurance written as the financial performance goals used in the 2018 bonus plan to provide an incentive for bottom line and top line growth. In late 2017, our Investor Relations department engaged a consulting firm to conduct an investor perception study for us.  Most investors (60-65%) responding to the survey indicated that they consider return on equity and book value growth to be the most appropriate measures of performance for the Company. These results confirmed to us the appropriateness of our use of a return on equity metric for the bonus plan and a book value growth metric for vesting of long-term equity awards. Following is a description of how the performance levels for our bonus plan's financial goals were established.
Return on Equity ("ROE")
As noted above, two of the objectives of our executive compensation program are to link compensation to Company performance and to design incentives so that the TDC of our NEOs moves above the median of our Benchmarking Peers when performance is strong. When the Committee established the ROE performance levels for the 2018 bonus plan, it considered those objectives and reviewed the ROEs earned by the Company's Benchmarking Peers, as well as those earned by a peer group constructed for MGIC by a leading proxy advisory service. The following table provides a comparison of the ROE performance levels for the Company's bonus plan to the benchmarks reviewed by the Committee. 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  39
Components —  Annual Bonus — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
The amount by which each of the Company's threshold, target and maximum ROE performance levels exceeded the average ROE earned by the peer groups, as well as the Company's cost of capital, confirmed the Committee's January 2018 view that the ROE performance levels were appropriately rigorous.
[BEGIN TABLE]
ROE Performance Levels for Company's Bonus Plan Compared to Benchmarks   
Company's Threshold ROE (for no bonus payout)(1) 10.0% 
Company's Target ROE (for 50% bonus payout)(1) 13.5% 
Company's Maximum ROE (for 100% bonus payout)(1) 17.0% 
Average 2017 ROE of Company's Benchmarking Peers(2) 6.0% 
Average 2017 ROE of Peers Selected by a Leading Proxy Advisory Service(2) 7.0% 
(1)  For purposes of the bonus plan, we calculate ROE as adjusted net operating income, divided by beginning shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Adjusted net operating income is a non-GAAP measures of performance. For a description of how we calculate this measure and for a reconciliation of this measure to its nearest comparable GAAP measures, see Appendix B. 
(2) Represents 2017 Net income available to common shareholder, adjusted (from Bloomberg), adjusted (generally upward) to reflect the pro forma effect of lower 2018 statutory federal income tax rates following the enactment of the Tax Act, divided by beginning shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  
[END TABLE]
The Company's 2018 target ROE of 13.5% was approximately equal to the Company's actual 2017 ROE, adjusted (a) upward to reflect the lower 2018 statutory income tax rates (21% in 2018 compared to 35% in 2017), (b) downward to reflect the increase in beginning shareholders' equity before accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ($3.2 billion in 2018 vs. $2.6 billion in 2017) and (c) downward to reflect the 2017 favorable development experienced in our loss reserves associated with insured mortgages that became delinquent prior to January 1, 2017 (no amount of favorable loss reserve development was forecast to occur in 2018).

[END TABLE]
Our 2018 NIW target performance level of $49.1 billion was set equal to our 2017 actual NIW, while the maximum performance level required a 6% increase over our 2017 NIW. The target performance level reflected the significant challenges we faced, including intense price and other competition within our industry, and continued strong competition from the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. In addition, at the time the bonus metrics were established, the 2018 mortgage origination market was expected to decline from 2017 levels due to declines in refinancing originations more than offsetting a small increase in purchase originations. Our actual NIW in 2017 was at the highest level since 2007 and increased by $1.2 billion over 2016 (a 2.5% increase).

CEO 2018 Bonus Alignment and Benchmarking Results.  The following chart illustrates that our CEO's bonuses have been reasonable when viewed in relationship to the strong growth in the Company's adjusted net operating income and have been reasonably aligned with the five-year increase in our stock price. The high volatility of our stock price (its three-year, monthly beta was in the 20th percentile of the Russell 3000 in February 2019 and our stock previously had the second highest beta in that index) makes it problematic to evaluate pay for performance alignment for us by measuring stock price performance over a single period.

The following chart demonstrates that the Company's ROE continued to well-exceed the average ROE of its Benchmarking Peers and the peer group constructed for the Company by a leading proxy advisory service. In addition, it was above the 90th percentile for both groups. The chart also demonstrates the reasonableness of our CEO's compensation, in terms of dollars of pretax income earned by the Company per dollar of TDC earned by the CEO, when compared to the average for those same peer groups. The Company's pretax income per dollar of CEO TDC was higher than any company in the two groups.

Long-Term Equity Awards
Background Considerations.  Consistent with our belief that there should be a strong link between compensation and performance, long-term equity awards provide one of our most significant TDC opportunities. We emphasize this component of our executive compensation program because it aligns executives' interests with those of shareholders by linking compensation to both company performance and stock price, while fostering a long-term planning horizon and supporting the retention of our leadership team. Long-term equity awards at their grant date value represented 57% of the 2018 TDC of our CEO and averaged 51% of the 2018 TDC of our other current NEOs. 
Our CEO's long-term equity awards are in line with our Benchmarking Peers' practices. The following table shows how the Company's grant date value of long-term equity awards to our CEO compares to the awards to the CEOs of our Benchmarking Peer Group. Although still generally close to median, our percentile rank in 2018 was slightly higher due to the high stock price on the grant date of our awards in January 2018. As noted above, our stock's volatility is in the 20th percentile of stocks in the Russell 3000.  As a result of our stock price volatility, the date on which equity awards are made significantly affects the calculation of total compensation in the SCT and, as a result, the analysis of pay for performance alignment. For example, based on the high and low closing prices of our stock during 2018, the SCT value of the CEO's 2018 equity grant would have ranged between approximately $2.5 million and $4.2 million.

100% Cliff Vesting » The 2018 and 2017 Book Value (BV) Awards only cliff vest after three years based on compound achievement of an adjusted book value per share growth goal.  
100% BV Awards » The 2018 and 2017 BV Awards represent 100% of the equity awards to our NEOs in 2018 and 2017; no awards are time-vested. 
[END TABLE]
The 2018 and 2017 BV Awards each cliff vest after three years based on achievement of a three-year cumulative adjusted book value ("ABV") per share growth goal that represents a 16.4% and 13.5% compound annual growth in ABV, respectively. Book value growth was chosen as the performance goal in part because of its simplicity and relevance to management and investors. Book value growth measures cumulative build-up of equity in the Company; we believe its use as a metric aligns executive compensation with the financial strength of the Company. As noted above, most investors responding to an investor perception study performed for us indicated that they consider return on equity and book value growth to be the most appropriate measures of performance for the Company. These results confirmed to us the appropriateness of our use of a book value growth metric for vesting of long-term equity awards.

Our standard terms for stock awards provide that retirement will not result in forfeiture of the awards if, among other requirements, the award recipient retires at or after age 62, has been employed by us for at least seven years and continues in our employment for no less than one year after the date of the award (the "employment continuation condition"). In recognition of Mr. Lane's contributions during his long-term service with the Company, the employment continuation condition associated with Mr. Lane's 2018 award was waived upon his retirement. The award remains subject to the performance condition described above.
2016 Performance-Based Long-Term Equity Awards – BV (Book Value) Awards.  BV Awards represented 80% of the long-term equity awards granted in January 2016 to the CEO and NEOs who were Executive Vice Presidents ("EVPs"), and 60% of the awards to NEOs who were Senior Vice Presidents ("SVPs"). The three-year cumulative goal for 2016 equity awards represented a compound annual growth in ABV per share of 14.9%. ABV per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a description of how we calculate this measure and for a reconciliation of this measure to its nearest comparable GAAP measure, see Appendix B to this Proxy Statement. The table below shows:

2016 Other Long-Term Equity Awards - CR (Combined Ratio) Awards.  The remaining 20% of the long-term equity awards granted in January 2016 to the CEO and NEOs who were EVPs, and 40% of the awards to NEOs who were SVPs, vest through continued service during a three-year performance period, if the Combined Ratio is less than 40%. If the performance goal was not met for a particular year, the awards that were scheduled to vest that year would have been forfeited.  The Combined Ratio goal was met in 2018, therefore, the portion of the 2016 awards that were scheduled to vest in February 2019 did vest. 
With respect to all of the long-term equity awards, dividends are not paid currently, but when awards vest, a payment is made equal to the dividends that would have been paid had those vested awards been entitled to receive current dividends. We have not paid dividends since 2008.
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │ Components — Pension Plan — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Pension Plan
Our executive compensation program includes a qualified pension plan and a supplemental executive retirement plan. We believe retirement plans are an important element of a competitive compensation program. These plans compute retirement benefits based only on current cash compensation (salary and annual bonus) and therefore do not include long-term incentives that can result in substantial increases in pension value. We also offer a broad-based 401(k) plan to which we make contributions in cash. A description of our pension plan can be found following the table titled "Pension Benefits at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" in "Compensation and Related Tables" below.
Perquisites
To avoid an entitlement mentality, the perquisites we provide are minimal, ranging from $800 to $6,400 in 2018 for our current NEOs. The 2018 perquisites included club dues and expenses, a parking space at our headquarters and spousal travel in connection with conferences attended by our CEO. 
OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
No Employment Agreements
Our CEO and other NEOs do not have employment agreements other than those discussed below that become effective upon a change in control.
Stock Ownership by Named Executive Officers
Stock Ownership Guidelines.  We have stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers to encourage them to maintain an ownership interest in the Company and to mitigate potential risks from incentive arrangements. Stock considered owned consists of shares owned outright by the executive (including shares in the executive's account in our 401(k) plan), and unvested restricted stock and RSUs scheduled to vest within one year (assuming ratable vesting over the performance period).
The stock ownership guidelines require ownership of stock valued at six times base salary for our CEO and stock valued at three times base salary for the other NEOs. Until the guideline is met, an NEO must not dispose of the portion of shares received upon vesting of equity awards equal to the lower of 25% of the shares that vested and 50% of the shares that were received by the NEO after taking account of shares withheld to cover taxes.
Each of our NEOs is in compliance with our stock ownership policy. The table below shows the guidelines, shares considered owned as of December 31, 2018 for purposes of the guidelines, and the multiple of base salary represented by that ownership for our CEO and all other current NEOs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Guideline (value of shares) Actual Ownership (value at 12/31/18) Actual Ownership as a Multiple of Base Salary

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS — Other Aspects
Excluding shares withheld from equity awards for income tax withholding, the last time any of our current or past NEOs sold our stock while an NEO was more than 12 years ago.
Hedging, Pledging and 10b5-1 Plan Prohibitions
Under our hedging policy, our directors, NEOs, other officers and certain other employees may not enter into hedging transactions referencing the Company's equity securities, which for these purposes include, but are not limited to, vested and unvested RSUs and company stock held directly or indirectly. Under our pledging policy, those same individuals may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan.  Our insider trading policy prohibits the use by those individuals of plans created pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act which, for example, may otherwise have allowed such persons to sell our stock while in possession of material undisclosed information about us.
"Clawback" Policy
Under our "clawback" policy, the Company will seek to recover from any NEO or other executive officer, to the extent the Committee deems appropriate, amounts associated with cash incentive compensation that was earned and equity awards that vested based on achievement of a performance goal if a subsequent financial restatement shows that such compensation should not have been paid.
Change in Control Provisions 
Each of our NEOs is a party to a Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreement with us (a "KEESA"), as described in the section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control – Change in Control Agreements" below. No executive officer has an employment or severance agreement, other than a KEESA. The period for which our KEESAs provide employment protection ends on the third anniversary of the date of a change in control. Our KEESAs provide for a cash payment in two lump sums (or one lump sum if neither the Company nor any affiliate's stock is publicly traded) only after both a change in control and a specified employment termination (a "double trigger"). Our KEESAs also provide for "double trigger" vesting of equity awards: there must be a change in control and an employment termination. 
The agreements for our outstanding equity awards provide that the equity will not vest upon a change in control if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith prior to the occurrence of the change in control that the awards will be assumed or replaced by the employee's employer immediately following the change in control with an alternative award meeting specified requirements. 
Our KEESAs do not contain a gross-up by the Company for any excise tax payments resulting from payments upon a change in control. For participants with KEESAs effective on or after October 23, 2014, and/or who have reached age 62, payments under the KEESAs, or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company, are capped by reducing such payments to an amount that will not trigger payment of federal excise taxes on such payment. For participants with KEESAs effective before October 23, 2014, and who are younger than age 62, payments under the KEESAs, or under any other agreement with or plan of the Company, are similarly reduced only if the resulting after-tax value to the participant of the total payments upon a change in control is greater than the after-tax value to the participant if the cash payments were not so reduced with the participant responsible for the excise taxes.
For additional information about our KEESAs, see "Compensation and Related Tables – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control – Change in Control Agreements" below. 
Tax Deductibility Limit
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation in excess of $1 million paid during a year to certain covered executives. We expect the portion of 2018 compensation 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  45
Other Aspects — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
exceeding $1 million for income tax purposes that we provide to our "covered employees" will not be deductible. For 2018, our covered executives were Messrs. Sinks, Mattke, Hughes, Lane and Mackey. The Committee considered the impact of this Internal Revenue Code rule in developing, implementing and administering our compensation program for 2018. 
Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, Section 162(m) generally exempted qualifying performance-based compensation from the $1 million annual deduction. The Tax Act included "grandfather" rules that apply to certain written binding contracts in effect as of November 2, 2017. Although the rules allowing this exemption are complex, we believe that a portion of our equity awards granted in 2016 and 2017 qualify as tax-deductible. However, because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and related regulations, and the fact that such regulations and interpretations may change from time to time (with potentially retroactive effect), there is no certainty that compensation intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m) will be deductible. 
Beginning in 2018, as a result of the changes made to Code Section 162(m) by the Tax Act, our number of covered executives will increase to include the five executives listed above, plus any executive who serves as our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer at any time on or after January 1, 2018, or who is among our three most highly compensated officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for any year beginning with 2018. The Committee will continue to consider the deductibility of compensation in light of the revisions to Code Section 162(m) by the Tax Act; however, the primary goals of the executive compensation program are to attract and retain high-quality executives and to align compensation with long-term shareholder interests. 
In making decisions about executive compensation, we also consider the impact of other regulatory provisions, including the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code regarding non-qualified deferred compensation and the change in control provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
Process for Approving Compensation Components
The Committee's practice for many years has been to make equity awards and approve new salaries and bonuses at its meeting in late January, which normally follows our announcement of earnings for the prior year. The Committee also may approve changes in compensation at other times throughout the year. 
The Committee has not adjusted executive officers' future compensation based upon amounts realized or forfeited pursuant to previous equity awards.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Among its other duties, the Committee assists the oversight by the Board of Directors of MGIC Investment Corporation's executive compensation program, including approving corporate goals relating to compensation for the CEO and senior officers, evaluating the performance of the CEO and determining the CEO's annual compensation and approving compensation for MGIC Investment Corporation's other senior executives.
The Committee reviewed and discussed with management the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based upon this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in MGIC Investment Corporation's Proxy Statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

(1) Our equity awards are granted under programs described in "Components of our Executive Compensation Program — 2018 Long-Term Equity Awards" in our CD&A. The amounts shown in this column represent the grant date fair value of the restricted equity awards granted to NEOs in the years shown, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of restricted equity is based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, which was $15.81 in 2018, $10.41 in 2017 and $5.66 in 2016. The vesting of all of the awards represented in this column is subject to our meeting certain performance conditions. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, all of the figures in this column represent the value at the grant date based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions as of the grant date. If the full value of the applicable awards for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were shown, assuming the highest levels of the applicable performance conditions were achieved, rather than an amount based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions, then the amounts shown would have been:

Our standard terms for stock awards provide that retirement will not result in forfeiture of the awards if, among other requirements, the award recipient retires at or after age 62, has been employed by us for at least seven years and continues in our employment for no less than one year after the date of the award (the "employment continuation condition"). The Company waived the employment continuation condition associated with Mr. Lane's 2018 award. The value of Mr. Lane's 2018 award when the employment continuation condition was waived, based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions and the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, had decreased from $1,435,801 to $1,100,859. The award remains subject to the performance condition described in "Components of our Executive Compensation Program — 2018 Long-Term Equity Awards" in our CD&A.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Our 2018 bonus program is described in "Components of our Executive Compensation Program — Annual Bonus" in our CD&A. The percentage of the maximum bonuses paid was calculated based on a formula that compares actual performance to threshold, target and maximum performance achievement levels for two different financial performance goals (each with specific weights and in total weighted 75%) and a subjective assessment of performance against three different business objectives. Our 2016 and 2017 bonus programs were structurally similar to the 2018 bonus program, but considered a greater number of financial performance goals and business objectives. All goals for the 2016-2018 bonus programs were considered and approved by the Management Development, Nominating and Governance Committee.

(3) The Company does not maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for its employees. The amounts shown in this column reflect, if positive, the sum of (a) the aggregate change in present value of accumulated pension benefits during the year pursuant to our Pension Plan and our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") when retirement benefits are also provided under the SERP, and (b) distributions the named executive officer received from our Qualified Pension Plan or SERP during the year.  
[END TABLE]
The aggregate change in present value of accumulated pension benefits represents:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For other than Mr. Mackey, the difference between (a) the present value of the annual pension payments that the named executive officer would be entitled to receive beginning at age 62, or current age if older than 62, and continuing for his life expectancy determined at the end of the year shown and by assuming that the officer's employment with us ended on the last day of the year shown, and (b) the same calculation done as if the officer's employment had ended one year earlier.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Mackey, the difference between (a) the present value as of year-end of the accumulated benefit under the "Cash Component" (described following the table titled "Pension Benefits at 2018 Fiscal Year-End") of our Pension Plan, and (b) the same calculation as of the prior year-end.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For all years shown, the change in the present value of accumulated pension benefits between years represents the net result of (a) the officer being one year closer to the receipt of the pension payments, which generally means the present value is higher, and the annual pension payment (for Mr. Mackey, his accumulated benefit) is higher due to the additional benefit earned because of one more year (in the case of Mr. Lane, a partial year) of employment; (b) a change in actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit, primarily changes in the discount rate used to calculate the present value at the end of each of those years; (c) a decrease for the effect of distributions that the NEOs received from our Qualified Pension Plan or SERP; (d) an increase for (I) in the case of Mr. Sinks and Mr. Mattke, in-service distributions received from our SERP to pay their portion of social security taxes and related income tax from such distributions; and (II) in the case of Mr. Lane, post-retirement annuity payments from our Qualified Pension Plan; and (e) for Mr. Lane, the effects of the actual benefit election made upon retirement.

The Company waived the employment continuation condition associated with Mr. Lane's 2018 award. The value of Mr. Lane's 2018 award when the employment continuation condition was waived, based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions and the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, had decreased from $1,435,801 to $1,100,859.

See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018 for the discount rate used to calculate the present value of benefits under these plans. The amount shown in this column for Mr. Mackey is the present value as of December 31, 2018 of the accumulated benefit under the "Cash Component" (described below) of our Pension Plan, assuming retirement at age 65 (the earliest age at which unreduced benefits may be received under the Cash Component of the Pension Plan).

[END TABLE]
The Pension Plan has been redesigned, effective January 1, 2014. As described below, under the redesigned Pension Plan and SERP, employees hired after December 31, 2013 accrue retirement benefits under a cash balance formula (the "Cash Balance Component"). Employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 continued to accrue benefits under the current Pension Plan design through December 31, 2018 (the "Prior Plan Component"). Effective January 1, 2019, all participants will accrue benefits under the Cash Balance Component.
Named Executive Officers Hired Prior to January 1, 2014
During 2018, the NEOs (other than Mr. Mackey, who was hired in 2015) continued to accrue benefits under the Prior Plan Component. Under the Pension Plan and the SERP taken together within the Prior Plan Component, those executive officers each earn an annual pension credit for each year of employment equal to 2% of the officer's eligible compensation for that year. Eligible compensation is limited to salaries, wages, cash bonuses (which for this purpose also includes payments listed in the Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Plan column in the Summary Compensation Table), and the portion of cash bonuses deferred and converted to restricted equity bonuses (applicable for bonuses for 1999 through 2006 performance).  At retirement, the annual pension credits are added together to determine the employee's accrued pension benefit. However, the annual pension credits for service prior to 1998 for each employee with at least five years 
MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement  │  53
Pension Benefits — COMPENSATION AND RELATED TABLES
of vested service on January 1, 1998 will generally be equal to 2% of the employee's average eligible compensation for the five years ended December 31, 1997. Eligible employees with credited service for employment prior to October 31, 1985 also receive a past service benefit, which is generally equal to the difference between the amount of pension the employee would have been entitled to receive for service prior to October 31, 1985 under the terms of a prior plan had such plan continued, and the amount the employee is actually entitled to receive under an annuity contract purchased when the prior plan was terminated. Retirement benefits vest on the basis of a graduated schedule over a seven-year period of service. Full pension benefits are payable in monthly installments or a lump-sum upon retirement at or after age 65 with at least five years of service (age 62 if the employee has completed at least seven years of service). Any supplemental executive retirement benefits are payable in a lump sum six months after service with the company ends. In addition, reduced benefits are payable beginning at any age following termination. Mr. Sinks is eligible for his full retirement benefits.
If the employment of our active NEOs (other than Mr. Mackey) terminated effective December 31, 2018, the annual amounts payable to them at age 62 (or current age if older than 62) under the Pension Plan and the SERP would have been Mr. Sinks – $220,000; Mr. Mattke – $130,918; Mr. Hughes –$174,352; and Mr. Miosi – $142,156 and the lump-sum payment for supplemental executive retirement benefits would have been: Mr. Sinks – $3,971,936; Mr. Mattke – $513,867; Mr. Hughes – $245,686; and Mr. Miosi – $237,656. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Sinks was eligible to receive this level of benefit because he was age 62 and had more than seven years' tenure. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Mattke, Hughes and Miosi were each eligible to receive reduced benefits under these plans upon termination of employment. If their employment had been terminated effective December 31, 2018, the annual amounts payable under these plans had each one elected to begin receiving annual payments immediately would have been: Mr. Mattke – $18,984; Mr. Hughes – $119,436; and Mr. Miosi – $45,420; and the lump-sum payment for supplemental executive retirement benefits would have been:  Mr. Mattke – $162,451; Mr. Hughes – $185,762; and Mr. Miosi – $118,605. The discount rate and post-retirement mortality assumptions used to calculate the lump-sum payments differ from the factors used in our financial statements.
Named Executive Officers Hired on or after January 2, 2014
Mr. Mackey's accumulated benefit in the Cash Balance Component of the Pension Plan is based on an annual credit of 4% of his plan eligible compensation (described above) and an annual interest credit based on the yield of the 30-year Treasury securities.  Similar to the Prior Plan Component of the Pension Plan, benefits in excess of the qualified plan are eligible for accrual in the SERP.  Benefits in the Cash Balance Component fully vest upon the earlier of three years of service or attainment of normal retirement age.  If the employment of Mr. Mackey terminated effective December 31, 2018, the annual amounts payable to him at age 65 under the Pension Plan and the SERP would have been $10,161 and the lump-sum payment for supplemental executive retirement benefits would have been $48,755. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Mackey was eligible to receive reduced benefits under these plans upon termination of employment. If his employment had been terminated effective December 31, 2018, the annual amounts payable under these plans had he elected to begin receiving annual payments immediately would have been $7,198 and the lump-sum payment for supplemental executive retirement benefits would have been $39,488. The discount rate and post-retirement mortality assumptions used to calculate the lump-sum payments differ from the factors used in our financial statements.

(1) As described further in "Change in Control Agreements and Severance Pay" below, each of our current NEOs is a party to a KEESA that may provide for payments after a change in control. A qualifying termination is a termination within three years after the change in control by the Company other than for cause, death or disability or by the executive for good reason. Amounts are payable in one or two lump sums, depending on limits on amounts that may be paid within six months under applicable tax rules and regulations. The first lump sum is payable within 10 business days after the termination date and the second lump sum, if required by applicable tax rules and regulations, is payable six months thereafter. 
[END TABLE]
For KEESA participants who have reached age 62 or whose KEESAs are dated after October 22, 2014, payments under the KEESAs were capped by reducing such payments to an amount that will not trigger payment of federal excise taxes on such payment. For KEESA participants who are younger than age 62 and whose KEESAs are dated on or before October 22, 2014, payments under the KEESAs are similarly reduced only if the resulting after-tax value to the participant of the total payments upon a change in control was greater than the after-tax value to the participant if the cash payments were not so reduced with the participant responsible for the excise taxes. Cash payments were reduced as follows: Mr. Sinks — $2,149,171; Mr. Mattke — $879,608; Mr. Hughes — $2,273,989; Mr. Mackey — $2,434,365; and Mr. Miosi — $2,207,894. Other benefits were reduced as follows: Mr. Hughes — $113,684; and Mr. Miosi — $50,386.

Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control — COMPENSATION AND RELATED TABLES
Mr. Lane retired on August 31, 2018. Our standard terms for stock awards provide that retirement will not result in forfeiture of the awards if, among other requirements, the award recipient retires at or after age 62, has been employed by us for at least seven years and continues in our employment for no less than one year after the date of the award (the "employment continuation condition"). At his retirement date, Mr. Lane had 145,568 outstanding restricted stock units that were eligible for continued vesting by their terms. Those units were valued at the stock price on his retirement date and are expected to vest if certain performance conditions are met as follows: 39,968 units awarded in January 2016 vested in the first quarter of 2019; and 105,600 units awarded in January 2017 are expected to vest in February 2020.
The Company waived the employment continuation condition associated with the 105,600 restricted units awarded to Mr. Lane in January 2018. The value of Mr. Lane's 2018 award when the employment continuation condition was waived, based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions and the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date, was $1,100,859. The award remains subject to the performance condition described in "Components of our Executive Compensation Program — 2018 Long-Term Equity Awards" in our CD&A.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3) For other than Mr. Lane, in connection with a change in control, other benefits include three years of health and welfare benefits, outplacement costs, and an allowance for tax, legal and accounting fees. 
[END TABLE]
For Mr. Lane, the amount reflects the 2018 bonus payment made to him upon his retirement, based on the then-forecasted 2018 bonus percentage, pro-rated for his employment period in 2018.
For an estimate of the value of pension benefits for an NEO upon retirement, please see the Pension Benefits Table.
Change in Control Agreements and Severance Pay
Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreement:  Each of our NEOs is a party to a KEESA. If a change in control occurs and the executive's employment is terminated within three years after the change in control (this period is referred to as the employment period), other than for cause, death or disability, or if the executive terminates his employment for good reason, the executive is entitled to receive a termination payment of twice the sum of his annual base salary, his maximum bonus award and an amount for pension accruals and profit sharing and matching contributions to our tax‑qualified defined contribution plan, subject to reduction as described below. This termination payment is payable in one or two lump sums, depending on limits on amounts that may be paid within six months under applicable tax rules and regulations. The first lump sum is payable within 10 business days after the termination date and the second lump sum, if required by applicable tax rules and regulations, is payable six months thereafter.
If the employment termination occurs during the employment period but more than three months after the change in control, the termination payment is reduced by an amount corresponding to the portion of the employment period that has elapsed since the date of the change in control. The KEESAs require that, for a period of twelve months after a termination for which a payment is required, the executive not compete with us unless approved in advance in writing by our Board of Directors. The KEESAs also impose confidentiality obligations on our executives.
Under the KEESAs, a change in control generally would occur upon the acquisition by certain unrelated persons of 50% or more of our Common Stock; an exogenous change in the majority of our Board of Directors; certain mergers, consolidations or share exchanges or related share issuances; or our sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. We would have "cause" to terminate an executive under a KEESA if the executive were intentionally to engage in certain bad faith conduct causing demonstrable and serious financial injury to us; to be convicted of certain felonies; or to willfully, unreasonably and continuously refuse to perform his or her existing duties or responsibilities. An executive would have "good reason" under his or her KEESA if we were to breach the terms of the KEESA or make certain changes to the executive's position or working conditions.
While the executive is employed during the employment period, the executive is entitled to a base salary no less than the base salary in effect prior to the change in control and to a bonus opportunity of no less than 75% of the maximum bonus opportunity in effect prior to the change in control. The executive is also entitled to participate in medical and other specified benefit plans. Such benefits include life insurance benefits made available to salaried employees generally and 
56 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
COMPENSATION AND RELATED TABLES — Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control other benefits provided to executives of comparable rank, including stock awards, supplemental retirement benefits and periodic physicals. The value of these benefits cannot be less than 75% of the value of comparable benefits prior to the change in control, except that if the new parent company does not provide stock‑based compensation to executives of its U.S. companies of comparable rank, this type of benefit need not be provided and the 75% minimum for other benefits is raised to 100%. If the executive experiences a qualified termination, he is entitled to continued life and health insurance for the remainder of the employment period or, if earlier, the time he obtains similar coverage from a new employer, outplacement services and up to a total of $10,000 to cover tax preparation, legal and accounting services relating to the KEESA termination payment.
Our KEESAs were modified in 2014 to remove the gross-up by the Company for excise tax payments resulting from payments upon a change in control. The form of KEESA is filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. The foregoing description is only a summary and is qualified by the actual terms of the KEESA.
Post-Termination Vesting of Certain Restricted Equity Awards:  In general, our restricted equity awards outstanding as of December 31, 2018 are forfeited upon a termination of employment, other than as a result of the award recipient's death (in which case the entire award vests). In general, if employment termination occurs after age 62 for a recipient who has been employed by us for at least seven years, awards granted at least one year prior to the date of the employment termination will continue to vest if the recipient enters into a non-competition agreement with us. One of our current NEOs is 62 or older. 
Our equity awards provide that the equity will not vest upon a change in control if the Committee reasonably determines in good faith prior to the occurrence of the change in control that the awards will be assumed or replaced by the employee's employer immediately following the change in control with an alternative award meeting specified requirements.  For purposes of the table above, we assume that the awards will be so assumed or replaced.
Severance Pay:  Although we do not have a written severance policy for terminations of employment unrelated to a change in control, we have historically negotiated severance arrangements with officers whose employment we terminate without cause. The amount that we have paid has varied based upon the officer's tenure and position.

The Company is using the same median employee for calculating the 2018 CEO pay ratio that it used for calculating the 2017 CEO pay ratio. Our median 2017 employee was determined by considering, for each employee employed by us as of December 31, 2017, the sum of "pension eligible compensation" and the "change in pension value" during 2017. "Pension eligible compensation" includes base wages, commission, overtime pay and bonuses paid in 2017. The "pension eligible compensation" is derived from our payroll records. The "change in pension value" is calculated in the same manner as it is for the SCT and is provided by our pension consultant. 
There have been no changes to the Company's employee population or compensation arrangements for 2018 that the Company believes would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. Changes in actuarial assumptions can cause large fluctuations in the change in pension value of our employees from year-to-year. In 2018, the median employee's total compensation included no increase in pension value, compared to an increase of approximately $50,000 in 2017. 
OTHER MATTERS
Related Person Transactions
Among other things, our Code of Business Conduct prohibits us from entering into transactions in which our "Senior Financial Officers," executive officers, or their respective immediate family members have a material personal financial interest (either directly or through a company with which the officer has a relationship) unless all of the following conditions are satisfied:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the terms of the contract or transaction are fair and equitable, at arm's length and are not detrimental to our interests; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the existence and nature of the interests of the officer are fully disclosed to and approved by the Audit Committee; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the interested officer has not participated on our behalf in the consideration, negotiation or approval of the contract or transaction. 
[END TABLE]
The Code defines a material interest as one in which our officer is a director or officer of the counterparty to the transaction, or our officer or a member of our officer's immediate family has a financial interest in such counterparty that has a value of at least 10% of the value of such counterparty. Our Audit Committee does not consider payments and benefits arising in the ordinary course of employment with us, or through services as a director, to be "transactions" subject to its approval.
58 │ MGIC Investment Corporation – 2019 Proxy Statement 
OTHER MATTERS
In addition, the Code requires Audit Committee approval of all transactions with any director or a member of the director's immediate family, other than transactions involving the provision of goods or services in the ordinary course of business of both parties. The Code contemplates that our non-management directors will disclose all transactions between us and parties related to the director, even if they are in the ordinary course of business.
We have used the law firm of Foley & Lardner LLP as our principal outside legal counsel since the founding of our predecessor company in 1957. Mr. Lane, our former General Counsel who retired in 2018, was formerly a partner of that law firm and his wife is currently a partner in that law firm. In 2018, Foley & Lardner was paid $594,737 by us and our consolidated subsidiaries for legal services. Our Audit Committee had been advised by our former General Counsel that his wife does not have a material interest in Foley & Lardner.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers and directors to file reports of their beneficial ownership of our stock and changes in stock ownership with the SEC. Based in part on statements by the directors and executive officers, we believe that all Section 16(a) forms were timely filed by our directors and executive officers in 2018.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee assists the oversight by the Board of Directors of the integrity of MGIC Investment Corporation's financial statements, the effectiveness of its system of internal controls, the qualifications, independence and performance of its independent accountants, the performance of its internal audit function, and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), MGIC Investment Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, its audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including Auditing Standard No. 1301. The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding auditor-audit committee communications about independence and discussed with PwC their independence from MGIC Investment Corporation and its management.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that MGIC Investment Corporation's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which has been filed with the SEC. These are the same financial statements that appear in MGIC Investment Corporation's Annual Report to Shareholders.

ITEM 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has reappointed the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Board is seeking shareholder ratification of the appointment even though ratification is not legally required. If shareholders do not ratify this appointment, the Audit Committee will take this into consideration in its future selection of an independent registered public accounting firm. A representative of PwC is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will be given an opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions.
Audit and Other Fees
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, PwC billed us fees for services of the following types:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018 2017 
Audit Fees $ 2,328,800   $ 2,200,000   
Audit-Related Fees 107,140   101,075   
Tax Fees 35,778   35,784   
All Other Fees 3,870   3,870   
Total Fees $ 2,475,588   $ 2,340,729   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees include PwC's review of our quarterly financial statements and audit of our year-end financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. Audit-Related Fees include the preparation of a SOC2 report (SOC is an abbreviation for Service Organization Controls). Tax Fees include a review of our tax returns. All Other Fees include subscription fees for an online library of financial reporting and assurance literature.
The rules of the SEC regarding auditor independence provide that independence may be impaired if the auditor performs services without the pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Committee's policy regarding pre-approval of audit and allowable non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor includes a list of services that are pre-approved as they become necessary and the Committee's approving of a schedule of other services expected to be performed during the ensuing year prior to the start of the annual audit engagement. If we desire the auditor to provide a service that is not in either category, the service may be presented for pre-approval by the Committee at its next meeting or may be pre-approved by the Chairperson (or another Committee member designated by the Committee). The Committee member approving the service will be given detail regarding the service equivalent to the detail that would be given to the Committee, and the Committee will be notified of the approved service at its next regularly scheduled meeting. We periodically provide the Committee with information about fees paid for services that have been approved and pre-approved. The Audit Committee pre-approved all of the services that PwC provided in 2018.

Appendix A - 1
APPENDIX B — RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES
We believe that use of the Non-GAAP measures of adjusted net operating income and adjusted net operating income per diluted share facilitates the evaluation of the company's core financial performance thereby providing relevant information to investors. These measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance.  Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by us.
Adjusted net operating income is defined as GAAP net income excluding the after-tax effects of net realized investment gains (losses), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, net impairment losses recognized in income (loss), and infrequent or unusual non-operating items, where applicable, which include the effects of changes in our deferred tax valuation allowance. The amounts of adjustments to components of pre-tax operating income are tax effected using a federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 35 for 2017 and 2016%.
Adjusted net operating income per diluted share is calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share, by dividing (i) adjusted net operating income after making adjustments for interest expense on convertible debt, whenever the impact is dilutive, by (ii) diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, which reflects share dilution from unvested restricted stock units and from convertible debt when dilutive under the "if-converted" method. 
Although adjusted net operating income excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent items that are: (1) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (2) impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These excluded items, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. Trends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these excluded items.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) Net realized investment gains (losses). The recognition of net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the timing of individual securities sales is highly discretionary and is influenced by such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles.  
(2) Gains and losses on debt extinguishment. Gains and losses on debt extinguishment result from discretionary activities that are undertaken to enhance our capital position, improve our debt profile, and/or reduce potential dilution from our outstanding convertible debt. 
(3) Net impairment losses recognized in earnings. The recognition of net impairment losses on investments can vary significantly in both size and timing, depending on market credit cycles, individual issuer performance, and general economic conditions.  
(4) Infrequent or unusual non-operating items. Our income tax expense for 2017 reflects the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets to reflect the lower corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act. Our 2018, 2017 and 2016 income tax expense also includes amounts related to our IRS dispute and is related to past transactions which are non-recurring in nature and are not part of our primary operating activities.

Reconciliation of Book Value per Share to Adjusted Book Value ("ABV") per Share
The grant documents for each of the 2018, 2017 and 2016 equity awards provide for certain specific eliminations to be made in arriving at ABV per share. In addition, the Omnibus Incentive Plans under which the awards were made provide for various adjustments in addition to those specified above that are automatically taken into account in the determination of book value per share, unless the Committee provides within specified timeframes that one or more such adjustments are to be excluded. Following is the reconciliation of book value per share to ABV per share used in determining vesting of each of the 2018, 2017 and 2016 equity awards.
