PROPOSAL: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES 
In accordance with PCN's, PTY's, PKO's and PCI's Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (each, a "Declaration"), and PCM's Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Articles"), the Trustees have been divided into the following three classes (each, a "Class"): Class I, Class II and Class III. The Nominating Committee and the Board of each applicable Fund have recommended the nominees listed herein for election or re-election, as applicable, as Trustees by the Shareholders of the applicable Funds. 
PCM. With respect to PCM, the term of office of the Class I Directors and David N. Fisher, a Class III Director, will expire at the Meeting; the term of office of the Class II Directors will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020); and the term of office of the Class III Directors will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). Currently, Sarah E. Cogan, James A Jacobson and William B. Ogden, IV are Class I Directors, John C. Maney is a Class II Director and David N. Fisher is a Class III Director. The Nominating Committee has recommended to the Board that Ms. Cogan be nominated for election by the Common Shareholders as a Class I Director, that Mr. Maney, who currently serves as a Class II Director, and Mr. Jacobson be nominated for re-election by the Common Shareholders as Class I Directors, that Mr. Ogden, who currently serves as a Class I Director, be nominated for re-election by the Common Shareholders as a Class II Director, and that Mr. Fisher be nominated for election by the Common Shareholders as a Class III Director at the Meeting. Consistent with the Fund's Articles, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, the nominees shall hold office for terms coinciding with the Classes of Directors to which they have been designated. Therefore, if elected or re-elected, as applicable at the Meeting, Ms. Cogan and Messrs. Jacobson and   Maney will serve terms consistent with the Class I Directors, which will expire at the Fund's annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2021-2022 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022), Mr. Ogden will serve a term consistent with the Class II Directors, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020), and Mr. Fisher will serve a term consistent with the Class III Directors, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). 
PTY. With respect to PTY, the term of office of the Class I Trustees, Sarah E. Cogan and David N.

Currently, John C. Maney, William B. Ogden, IV and Alan Rappaport are Class I Trustees, Sarah E. Cogan is a Class II Trustee and David N. Fisher is a Class III Trustee. The Nominating Committee has recommended to the Board that Messrs.

Therefore, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, at the Meeting, Mses. Cogan and DeCotis and Mr. Maney will serve terms consistent with the Class II Trustees, which will expire at the Fund's annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2021-2022 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022), Mr. Jacobson will serve a term consistent with the Class I Trustees, which will expire at the Fund's annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from August 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021), and Mr. Fisher will serve a term consistent with the Class III Trustees, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020).

Fisher will expire at the Meeting; the term of office of the Class III   Trustees will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020); and the term of office of the Class I Trustees will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). Currently, Sarah E. Cogan, John C. Maney and James A. Jacobson are Class II trustees, William B. Ogden, IV is a Class I Trustee and David N. Fisher is a Class III Trustee. The Nominating Committee has recommended to the Board that Ms. Cogan be nominated for election by the Common Shareholders as a Class II Trustee, that William B. Ogden, IV, who currently serves as a Class I Trustee, and Mr. Maney be nominated for re-election as Class II Trustees by the Common Shareholders, that Mr. Jacobson, who currently serves as a Class II Trustee, be nominated for re-election as a Class I Trustee by the Common Shareholders, and that David N. Fisher be nominated for election as a Class III Trustee by the Common Shareholders at the Meeting. Consistent with the Fund's Declaration, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, the nominees shall hold office for terms coinciding with the Classes of Trustees to which they have been designated. Therefore, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, at the Meeting, Ms. Cogan and Messrs. Maney and Ogden will serve terms consistent with the Class II Trustees, which will expire at the Fund's annual meeting of Shareholders for the 2021-2022 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022), Mr. Fisher will serve a term consistent with the Class III Trustees, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020), and Mr. Jacobson will serve a term consistent with the Class I Trustees, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). 
PCI. With respect to PCI, the term of office of the Class III Trustees and David N. Fisher will expire at the Meeting; the term of office of the Class I Trustees will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020); and the term of office of the Class II Trustees will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). Currently Sarah E. Cogan, Deborah A. DeCotis and John C. Maney are Class III Trustees, William B. Ogden, IV is a Class I Trustee and David N. Fisher is a Class II Trustee. The Nominating Committee has recommended to the Board that Ms. Cogan be nominated for election as a Class III Trustee by the Common Shareholders, that William B. Ogden, IV, who currently serves as a Class I Trustee, and Ms. DeCotis be   nominated for re-election by the Common Shareholders as Class III Trustees, that Mr. Maney, who currently serves as a Class III Trustee, be nominated for re-election as a Class I Trustee by the Common Shareholders, and that David N. Fisher be nominated for election as a Class II Trustee by the Common Shareholders at the Meeting. Consistent with the Fund's Declaration, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, the nominees shall hold office for terms coinciding with the Classes of Trustees to which they have been designated. Therefore, if elected or re-elected, as applicable, at the Meeting, Mses. Cogan and DeCotis and Mr. Ogden will serve terms consistent with the Class III Trustees, which will expire at the Fund's annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2021-2022 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022), Mr. Maney will serve a term consistent with the Class I Trustees, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2019-2020 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020), and Mr. Fisher will serve a term consistent with the Class II Trustees, which will expire at the annual meeting of Shareholders held during the 2020-2021 fiscal year (i.e., the annual meeting held during the fiscal year running from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021). 
All members of the Board of each of PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI are and will remain, if elected, "Continuing Trustees," as such term is defined in the Declaration of the applicable Fund, having either served as Trustee since the inception of the Fund or for thirty-six months, or having been nominated by at least a majority of the Continuing Trustees then members of the Board. Pursuant to the Declaration of PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI, certain corporate actions and/or transactions involving the Fund outside of the ordinary course of business (including, among others, mergers, consolidations, significant dispositions of Fund assets, any shareholder proposals as to specific investment decisions and the conversion of the Fund to an open-end fund) would require the approval of 75% of the Fund's outstanding shares, unless approved by both a majority of the Board of Trustees and 75% of the Continuing Trustees (in which case shareholders have only the voting rights required by the 1940 Act with respect to such transaction or corporate action, if any). 
At any annual meeting of Shareholders, any Trustee elected to fill a vacancy that has arisen since the preceding annual meeting of Shareholders (whether or not such vacancy has been filled by election of a new Trustee by the Board) shall hold office for a term that coincides with the term (or any remaining term) of the Class of Trustees to which such office was previously assigned, if such vacancy arose other than by an increase in the number of Trustees, and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify. In the event such vacancy arose due to an increase in the number of Trustees, any Trustee so elected to fill such   vacancy at an annual meeting shall hold office for a term which coincides with that of the Class of Trustee to which such office has been apportioned and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify. 
The following table summarizes the nominees who will stand for election or re-election at the Meeting, the respective Classes of Trustees to which they have been designated and the expiration of their respective terms if elected or re-elected, as applicable:

*  A Trustee elected or re-elected at an annual meeting shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in  which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.

[END TABLE]
Under this classified Board structure, generally only those Trustees in a single Class may be replaced in any one year, and it would require a minimum of two years to change a majority of the Board under normal circumstances. This structure, which may be regarded as an "anti-takeover" provision, may make it more difficult for a Fund's Shareholders to change the majority of Trustees of the Fund and, thus, promotes the continuity of management. 
Unless authority is withheld, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy for a Fund to vote each proxy for the persons listed above for that Fund. Each of the nominees has indicated he or she will serve if elected, but if he or she should be unable to serve for a Fund, the proxy holders may vote in favor of such substitute nominee as the Board may designate (or, alternatively, the Board may determine to save a vacancy).  Trustees and Officers 
The business of each Fund is managed under the direction of the Fund's Board. Subject to the provisions of each Fund's Declaration or Articles, its Bylaws and applicable state law, the Trustees have all powers necessary and convenient to carry out their responsibilities, including the election and removal of the Fund's officers. 
Board Leadership Structure — Currently, and assuming the nominees are elected as proposed, the Board of Trustees of each Fund consists and will continue to consist of nine Trustees, seven of whom are Independent Trustees. An Independent Trustee serves as Chair of the Board and is selected by a vote of the majority of the Independent Trustees. The Chair of the Board presides at meetings of the Board and acts as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys and other Trustees generally between meetings, and performs such other functions as may be requested by the Board from time to time. 
The Board of each Fund meets regularly four times each year to discuss and consider matters concerning the Funds, and also holds special meetings to address matters arising between regular meetings. The Independent Trustees regularly meet outside the presence of management and are advised by independent legal counsel. Regular meetings generally take place in-person; other meetings may take place in-person or by telephone. 
The Board has established six standing Committees to facilitate oversight of the management of the Funds: the Audit Oversight Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Valuation Oversight Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Contracts Committee and the Performance Committee. The functions and role of each Committee are described below under "Board Committees and Meetings." The membership of each Committee consists of all of the Independent Trustees, which the Board believes allows them to participate in the full range of the Board's oversight duties. In addition, the Performance Committee consists of all the Trustees. 
The Board reviews its leadership structure periodically and has determined that this leadership structure, including an Independent Chair, a supermajority of Independent Trustees and Committee membership limited to Independent Trustees (with the exception of the Performance Committee), is appropriate in light of the characteristics and circumstances of each Fund. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered, among other things, the predominant role of the Manager in the day-to-day management of Fund affairs, the extent to which the work of the Board is conducted through the Committees, the number of portfolios overseen by the Board that are advised by the Manager or have an investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the Manager (the "Fund   Complex"), the variety of asset classes those portfolios include, the assets of each Fund and the other portfolios overseen by the Board in the Fund Complex and the management and other service arrangements of each Fund and such other portfolios. The Board also believes that its structure, including the presence of two Trustees who are executives with the Manager or Manager-affiliated entities, facilitates an efficient flow of information concerning the management of each Fund to the Independent Trustees. 
Risk Oversight — Each of the Funds has retained the Manager to provide investment advisory services and administrative services. Accordingly, the Manager is immediately responsible for the management of risks that may arise from Fund investments and operations. Some employees of the Manager serve as the Funds' officers, including the Funds' principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, chief compliance officer and chief legal officer. The Manager and the Funds' other service providers have adopted policies, processes, and procedures to identify, assess and manage different types of risks associated with each Fund's activities. The Board oversees the performance of these functions by the Manager and the Funds' other service providers, both directly and through the Committee structure it has established. The Board receives from the Manager a wide range of reports, both on a regular and as-needed basis, relating to the Funds' activities and to the actual and potential risks of the Funds. These include reports on investment and market risks, custody and valuation of Fund assets, compliance with applicable laws, and the Funds' financial accounting and reporting. In addition, the Board meets periodically with the individual portfolio managers of the Funds or their delegates to receive reports regarding the portfolio management of the Funds and their performance, including their investment risks. In the course of these meetings and discussions with the Manager, the Board has emphasized the importance of the Manager maintaining vigorous risk-management programs and procedures with respect to the Funds. 
In addition, the Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"). The CCO oversees the development of compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to minimize the risk of violations of the federal securities laws ("Compliance Policies"). The CCO reports directly to the Independent Trustees, interacts with individuals within the Manager's organization and provides presentations to the Board at its quarterly meetings and an annual report on the application of the Compliance Policies. The Board periodically discusses relevant risks affecting the Funds with the CCO at these meetings. The Board has approved the Compliance Policies and reviews the CCO's reports. Further, the Board annually reviews the sufficiency of the Compliance Policies, as well as the appointment and compensation of the CCO. 
The Board recognizes that the reports it receives concerning risk management matters are, by their nature, typically summaries of the relevant   information. Moreover, the Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Funds can be identified in advance; that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks; that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) in seeking to achieve the Funds' investment objectives; and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness.

Trustee Qualifications — The Board has determined that each Trustee is qualified to serve as such based on several factors (none of which alone is decisive). Each Trustee, with the exception of Mr. Fisher and Ms. Cogan, has served in such role for several years. Mr. Fisher is a Managing Director and Head of Traditional Product Strategies at PIMCO and Ms. Cogan is Of Counsel, and formerly served as a Partner, at the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which served as counsel to the Independent Trustees of the Funds until December 31, 2018. Accordingly, each Trustee is knowledgeable about the Funds' business and service provider arrangements and, with the exception of Ms. Cogan and Mr. Fisher, has also served for several years as trustee or director to a number of other investment companies advised by the Manager and/or its affiliates. Among the factors the Board considered when concluding that an individual is qualified to serve on the Board were the following: (i) the individual's business and professional experience and accomplishments; (ii) the individual's ability to work effectively with other members of the Board; (iii) the individual's prior experience, if any, serving on the boards of public companies (including, where relevant, other investment companies) and other complex enterprises and organizations; and (iv) how the individual's skills, experiences and attributes would contribute to an appropriate mix of relevant skills and experience on the Board. 
In respect of each current Trustee, the individual's substantial professional accomplishments and prior experience, including, in some cases, in fields related to the operations of the Funds, were a significant factor in the determination by the Board that the individual is qualified to serve as a Trustee of the Funds. The following is a summary of various qualifications, experiences and skills of each Trustee (in addition to business experience during the past five years set forth in the table above) that contributed to the Board's conclusion that an individual is qualified to serve on the Board. References to qualifications, experiences and skills are not intended to hold out the Board or individual Trustees as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.

Board Committees and Meetings. 
Audit Oversight Committee. The Board of each Fund has established an Audit Oversight Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee currently consists of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden, Rappaport and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan, each of whom is an Independent Trustee. Mr. Jacobson serves as Chair of each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee. Each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee provides oversight with respect to the internal and external accounting and auditing procedures of the Fund and, among other things, determines the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund and considers the scope of the audit, approves all audit and permitted non-audit services proposed to be performed by those auditors on behalf of the Fund, and approves non-audit services to be performed by the auditors for certain affiliates, including the Manager and entities in a control relationship with the Manager that provide services to the Fund where the engagement relates directly to the operations and   financial reporting of the Fund. The Committee considers the possible effect of those services on the independence of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. Each member of each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee is "independent," as independence for audit committee members is defined in the currently applicable listing standards of the NYSE, on which the Common Shares of each Fund are listed. 
The Board of each Fund has adopted a written charter for its Audit Oversight Committee. A copy of the written charter for each Fund, as amended through December 13, 2018, is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A. A report of the Audit Oversight Committee of PCM, PKO and PCI, dated August 23, 2018, is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit C-1. A report of the Audit Oversight Committee of PCN and PTY, dated September 25, 2018, is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit C-2. 
Nominating Committee. The Board of each Fund has established a Nominating Committee composed solely of Independent Trustees, currently consisting of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden, Rappaport and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan. Ms. DeCotis serves as Chair of each Fund's Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending qualified candidates to the Board in the event that a position is vacated or created or when Trustees are to be re-elected. The Nominating Committee of each Fund has adopted a charter, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit B. 
Each member of each Fund's Nominating Committee is "independent," as independence for nominating committee members is defined in the currently applicable listing standards of the NYSE, on which the Common Shares of each Fund are listed. 
Qualifications, Evaluation and Identification of Trustees/Nominees. The Nominating Committee of each Fund requires that Trustee candidates have a college degree or equivalent business experience. When evaluating candidates, each Fund's Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors including, but not limited to: (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) ability, judgment and expertise and (v) overall diversity of the Board's composition. The process of identifying nominees involves the consideration of candidates recommended by one or more of the following sources: (i) the Fund's current Trustees, (ii) the Fund's officers, (iii) the Fund's investment adviser, (iv) shareholders of the Fund, and (v) any other source the Committee deems to   be appropriate. The Nominating Committee of each Fund may, but is not required to, retain a third party search firm at a Fund's expense to identify potential candidates. 
Consideration of Candidates Recommended by Shareholders. The Nominating Committee of each Fund will review and consider nominees recommended by Shareholders to serve as Trustees, provided that the recommending Shareholder follows the "Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates for the PIMCO Sponsored Closed-End Funds," which are set forth as Appendix B to the Funds' Nominating Committee Charter, attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit B. Among other requirements, these procedures provide that the recommending Shareholder must submit any recommendation in writing to the Fund, to the attention of the Fund's Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Fund and that such submission must be received at such offices not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at which the nominee would be elected. Any recommendation must include certain biographical and other information regarding the candidate and the recommending Shareholder, and must include a written and signed consent of the candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. The foregoing description of the requirements is only a summary. Please refer to Appendix B to the Nominating Committee Charter for each Fund, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit B for details. 
The Nominating Committee has full discretion to reject nominees recommended by Shareholders, and there is no assurance that any such person properly recommended and considered by the Committee will be nominated for election to the Board of each Fund. 
Diversity. The Nominating Committee takes diversity of a particular nominee and overall diversity of the Board into account when considering and evaluating nominees for Trustee. While the Committee has not adopted a particular definition of diversity, when considering a nominee's and the Board's diversity, the Committee generally considers the manner in which each nominee's professional experience, education, expertise in matters that are relevant to the oversight of the Funds (e.g., investment management, distribution, accounting, trading, compliance, legal), general leadership experience, and life experience are complementary and, as a whole, contribute to the ability of the Board to oversee the Funds. 
Valuation Oversight Committee. The Board of each Fund has established a Valuation Oversight Committee currently consisting of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden and Rappaport and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan.   Mr. Ogden serves as Chair of each Fund's Valuation Oversight Committee. The Valuation Oversight Committee has been delegated responsibility by the Board for overseeing determination of the fair value of each Fund's portfolio securities and other assets on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Funds' valuation procedures. The Valuation Oversight Committee of each Fund reviews and approves procedures for the fair valuation of the Fund's portfolio securities and periodically reviews information from the Manager regarding fair value determinations made pursuant to Board-approved procedures, and makes related recommendations to the full Board and assists the full Board in resolving particular fair valuation and other valuation matters. In certain circumstances as specified in the Funds' valuation policies, the Valuation Oversight Committee may also determine the fair value of portfolio holdings after consideration of all relevant factors, which determinations shall be reported to the full Board. 
Compensation Committee. The Board of each Fund has established a Compensation Committee currently consisting of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden, Rappaport and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan. Ms. DeCotis serves as Chair of each Fund's Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee meets as the Board deems necessary to review and make recommendations regarding compensation payable to the Trustees of the Funds who are not directors, officers, partners or employees of the Manager or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Manager. 
Contracts Committee. The Board of each Fund has established a Contracts Committee currently consisting of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden, Rappaport and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan.

The Contracts Committee meets as the Board deems necessary to review the performance of, and the reasonableness of the fees paid to, as applicable, the Funds' investment adviser(s) and any sub-adviser(s), administrators(s) and principal underwriters(s) and to make recommendations to the Board regarding the approval and continuance of each Fund's contractual arrangements for investment advisory, sub-advisory, administrative and distribution services, as applicable. 
Performance Committee. The Board has established a Performance Committee, which consists of Messrs. Gallagher, Jacobson, Kertess, Ogden, Rappaport, Maney and Fisher and Mses. DeCotis and Cogan.

Shareholder Communications with the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees of each Fund has adopted procedures by which Shareholders may send communications to the Board. Shareholders may mail written communications to the Board to the attention of the Board of Trustees, [name of Fund], c/o Fund Administration, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019. Shareholder communications must (i) be in writing and be signed by the Shareholder and (ii) identify the class and number of Shares held by the Shareholder. The Secretary of each Fund or her designee is responsible for reviewing properly submitted shareholder communications. The Secretary shall either (i) provide a copy of each properly submitted shareholder communication to the Board at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting or (ii) if the Secretary determines that the communication requires more immediate attention, forward the communication to the Trustees promptly after receipt. The Secretary may, in good faith, determine that a shareholder communication should not be provided to the Board because it does not reasonably relate to a Fund or its operations, management, activities, policies, service providers, Board, officers, shareholders or other matters relating to an investment in a Fund or is otherwise routine or ministerial in nature. These procedures do not apply to (i) any communication from an officer or Trustee of a Fund, (ii) any communication from an employee or agent of a Fund, unless such communication is made solely in such employee's or agent's capacity as a shareholder, or (iii) any shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or any communication made in connection with such a proposal. A Fund's Trustees are not required to attend the Fund's annual shareholder meetings or to otherwise make themselves available to shareholders for communications, other than by the aforementioned procedures. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Each Fund's Trustees and certain officers, investment adviser, certain affiliated persons of the investment adviser and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of any class of outstanding securities of a Fund (i.e., a Fund's Common Shares or Preferred Shares) are required to file forms reporting their affiliation with the   Fund and reports of ownership and changes in ownership of the Fund's securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the NYSE. These persons and entities are required by SEC regulation to furnish each Fund with copies of all such forms they file. Based solely on a review of these forms furnished to each Fund during the most recently concluded fiscal year, each Fund believes that each of the Trustees and officers, investment adviser and relevant affiliated persons of the investment adviser and the persons who beneficially own more than 10% of any class of outstanding securities of the Fund has complied with all applicable filing requirements during each Fund's respective fiscal year. 
Required Vote. The election of Ms. Cogan and Mr. Fisher, and the re-election of Messrs. Jacobson, Ogden and Maney, to the Board of Directors of PCM will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the Common Shareholders of the Fund cast in the election of Directors at the Meeting, in person or by proxy.

Maney and Ogden, to the Board of Trustees of PTY will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of the Common Shareholders and Preferred Shareholders (voting together as a single class) of the Fund cast in the election of Trustees at the Meeting, in person or by proxy. The re-election of Mr. Rappaport to the Board of Trustees of PTY will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of the Preferred Shareholders (voting as a separate class) of the Fund cast in the election of the Preferred Shares Trustee at the Meeting, in person or by proxy.

Each of the Funds' executive officers is an "interested person" of each Fund (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) as a result of his or her position(s) set forth in the table above. 
Investment Manager. The Manager serves as the investment manager of each of the Funds. Subject to the supervision of the Board of each Fund, the Manager is responsible for managing the investment activities of the Funds and the Funds' business affairs and other administrative matters. The Manager is located at 650 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, CA, 92660. The Manager is a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Allianz SE, a publicly traded European insurance and financial services company. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Oversight Committee of each Fund's Board and the full Board of each Fund unanimously selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019 for PKO, PCM and PCI and July 31, 2019 for PTY and PCN. PwC served as the independent registered public accounting firm of each Fund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 for PCM, PKO and PCI and July 31, 2018 for PTY and PCN and also serves as the independent registered public accounting firm of various other   investment companies for which the Manager serves as investment adviser. PwC is located at 300 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017. None of the Funds knows of any direct financial or material indirect financial interest of PwC in the Funds. A representative of PwC, if requested by any Shareholder, will be present at the Meeting via telephone to respond to appropriate questions from Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she chooses to do so. 
Pre-approval Policies and Procedures. Each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee has adopted written policies relating to the pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Under the policies, on at least an annual basis, a Fund's Audit Oversight Committee reviews and pre-approves proposed audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm on behalf of the Fund. 
In addition, each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee pre-approves at least annually any permitted non-audit services (including audit-related services) to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Manager and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Manager that provides ongoing services to the Fund (together, the "Accounting Affiliates"), provided, in each case, that the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. Although the Audit Oversight Committee does not pre-approve all services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to Accounting Affiliates (for instance, if the engagement does not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund), the Committee receives an annual report from the independent registered public accounting firm showing the aggregate fees paid by Accounting Affiliates for such services. 
Each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee may also from time to time pre-approve individual non-audit services to be provided to the Fund or an Accounting Affiliate that were not pre-approved as part of the annual process described above. A member of the Audit Oversight Committee to whom this responsibility has been delegated (a "Designated Member") may also pre-approve these individual non-audit services, provided that the fee for such services does not exceed a pre-determined dollar threshold. Any such pre-approval by the Designated Member is reported to the full Audit Oversight Committee for ratification at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
The pre-approval policies provide for waivers of the requirement that the Audit Oversight Committee pre-approve permitted non-audit services provided to the Funds or their Accounting Affiliates pursuant to de minimis exceptions described in Section 10A of the Exchange Act and applicable regulations (referred to herein as the "de minimis exception").  Audit Fees. Audit Fees are fees related to the audit and review of the financial statements included in annual reports and registration statements, and other services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. For each Fund's last two fiscal years as reflected below, the Audit Fees billed by PwC to the Fund or to PIMCO with respect to the Fund are shown in the table below:

The table below shows, for each Fund's last two fiscal years as reflected below, the Audit-Related Fees billed by PwC to the Fund or to PIMCO with respect to the Fund. During those fiscal years, there were no Audit-Related Fees billed by PwC to the Funds' Accounting Affiliates for audit-related services related directly to the operation and financial reporting of the Funds.

The table below shows a breakdown of the fees billed by PwC to each Fund, or to PIMCO with respect to each Fund, for the most recently completed fiscal year attributable the following categories: 1) Audit Fees, 2) Audit-Related Fees, 3) Tax Compliance/Preparation fees and 4) All Other Fees, as well as the percentage of the total fees billed attributable to the "All Other Fees" category. 
Each Fund's Audit Oversight Committee has determined that the provision by PwC of non-audit services to the Fund's Accounting Affiliates that were not pre-approved by the Committee was compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC as the Fund's principal auditors. 
Other Business. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, each Fund's officers and the Manager know of no business to come before the Meeting other than as set forth in the Notice. If any other business is properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote in their sole discretion. 
Quorum, Adjournments and Methods of Tabulation. A quorum for each of PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI at the Meeting will consist of the presence in person or by proxy of thirty percent (30%) of the total Shares of the Fund entitled to   vote at such Meeting, except that, where the Preferred Shares or Common Shares will vote as separate classes, then 30% of the shares of each class entitled to vote will be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that class. For PCM, the presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of Shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. If the quorum required for a Proposal has not been met, the persons named as proxies may propose adjournment of the Meeting with respect to such Proposal and, if adjournment is proposed, will vote all Shares that they are entitled to vote in favor of such adjournment. Any adjournments with respect to the Proposal for a Fund will require, with respect to PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast upon the question for the relevant Fund, and, with respect to PCM, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares of PCM entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be adjourned. However, where the Preferred Shares or Common Shares will vote as separate classes, the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares of the applicable class present in person or by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be adjourned will be necessary to adjourn the Meeting with respect to that class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to PCM, any officer present entitled to preside or act as Secretary of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting with respect to a proposal. The costs of any additional solicitation and of any adjourned session will be borne by PIMCO under its investment management agreement with the Funds. Any proposals properly before the Meeting for which sufficient favorable votes have been received by the time of the Meeting will be acted upon and such action will be final regardless of whether the Meeting is adjourned to permit additional solicitation with respect to any other proposal with respect to which a quorum has not been reached. In certain circumstances in which a Fund has received sufficient votes to approve a matter being recommended for approval by the Fund's Board, the Fund may request that brokers and nominee entities, in their discretion, withhold or withdraw submission of broker non-votes in order to avoid the need for solicitation of additional votes in favor of the proposal. 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be counted by persons appointed by PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI as tellers and by PCM as inspectors (collectively, the "Tellers/Inspectors") for the Meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for each Fund, the Tellers/Inspectors will include the total number of Shares present at the Meeting in person or by proxy, including Shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have the discretionary voting power on a particular matter). For a proposal requiring approval of a plurality of votes cast, such as the   election of Trustees, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted towards the achievement of a plurality of votes cast for a nominee and will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.

Shareholder Proposals for the Annual Meeting held during the 2019-2020 Fiscal Year. It is currently anticipated that each Fund's next annual meeting of Shareholders after the Meeting addressed in this Proxy Statement will be held in April 2020. Proposals of Shareholders intended to be presented at that annual meeting of each Fund must be received by each Fund no later than November 12, 2019 for inclusion in each Fund's proxy statement and proxy cards relating to that meeting. The submission by a Shareholder of a proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials does not guarantee that it will be included. Shareholder proposals are subject to certain requirements under the federal securities laws and must be submitted in accordance with the applicable Fund's Bylaws. Shareholders submitting any other proposals (including proposals to elect Trustee nominees) for each Fund intended to be presented at the annual meeting held during the 2018-2019 fiscal year (i.e., other than those to be included in the Fund's proxy materials) must ensure that such proposals are received by each Fund, in good order and complying with all applicable legal requirements and requirements set forth in each Fund's Bylaws. PCN's, PTY's, PKO's and PCI's Bylaws each provide that any such proposal must be received in writing by each Fund not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days prior to the first anniversary date of the date on which each Fund first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's shareholder meeting; provided that, if, in accordance with applicable law, the upcoming shareholder meeting is set for a date that is not within 30 days from the anniversary of each Fund's prior   shareholder meeting, such proposal must be received by the later of the close of business on (i) the date 45 days prior to such upcoming shareholder meeting date or (ii) the 10th business day following the date such upcoming shareholder meeting date is first publicly announced or disclosed. PCM's Bylaws provide that any such proposal must be received in writing by the Fund not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the prior year; provided that, if, in accordance with applicable law, the annual meeting is not set for a date that is within 30 days from the anniversary of the Fund's prior shareholder meeting, such proposals must be received by the later of the close of business on (i) the date 60 days prior to such upcoming shareholder meeting date or (ii) the 14th business day following the date such upcoming shareholder meeting date is first publicly announced or disclosed. Assuming the next annual meeting is ultimately scheduled to be within 30 days of the April 26 anniversary of this year's meeting, such proposals must be received no earlier than January 11, 2020 and no later than January 26, 2020 for PCN, PTY, PKO and PCI and no earlier than January 27, 2020 and no later than February 26, 2020 for PCM. If a Shareholder who wishes to present a proposal fails to notify the Fund within these dates described above, the proxies solicited for the meeting will be voted on the Shareholder's proposal, if it is properly brought before the meeting, in accordance with the judgment of the persons named in the enclosed proxy card(s). If a Shareholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may still exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances consistent with the SEC's proxy rules. Shareholder proposals should be addressed to the attention of the Secretary of the applicable Fund, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Fund, with a copy to David C. Sullivan, Ropes & Gray LLP, Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02199-3600.

March 8, 2019  Exhibit A to Proxy Statement 
PIMCO Sponsored Closed-End Funds 
Audit Oversight Committee Charter 
(Adopted as of January 14, 2004, as amended through December 13, 2018) 
The Board of Trustees (each a "Board") of each of the registered investment companies listed in Appendix A hereto (each, a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds"), as the same may be periodically updated, has adopted this Charter to govern the activities of the Audit Oversight Committee (the "Committee") of the particular Board with respect to its oversight of the Fund. This Charter applies separately to each Fund and its particular Board and Committee, and shall be interpreted accordingly. This Charter supersedes and replaces any audit committee charter previously adopted by the Board or a committee of the Board. 
Statement of Purpose and Functions 
The Committee's general purpose is to oversee the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices and its internal controls, including by assisting with the Board's oversight of the integrity of the Fund's financial statements, the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the Fund's independent auditors, and the performance of the Fund's internal control systems and independent auditors. The Committee's purpose is also to prepare reports required by Securities and Exchange Commission rules to be included in the Fund's annual proxy statements, if any. 
The Committee's function is oversight. While the Committee has the responsibilities set forth in this Charter, it is not the responsibility of the Committee to plan or conduct audits, to prepare or determine that the Fund's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or to assure compliance with laws, regulations or any internal rules or policies of the Fund. Fund management is responsible for Fund accounting and the implementation and maintenance of the Fund's internal control systems, and the independent auditors are responsible for conducting a proper audit of the Fund's financial statements. Members of the Committee are not employees of the Funds and, in serving on this Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors. As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. 
A-1 
Each member of the Committee shall be entitled to rely on (i) the integrity of those persons and organizations within management and outside the Fund from which the Committee receives information and (ii) the accuracy of financial and other information provided to the Committee by such persons or organizations absent actual knowledge to the contrary. 
Membership 
The Committee shall be comprised of as many trustees as the Board shall determine, but in any event not less than three (3) Trustees. Each member of the Committee must be a member of the Board. The Board may remove or replace any member of the Committee at any time in its sole discretion. One or more members of the Committee may be designated by the Board as the Committee's chairman or co- chairman, as the case may be. 
Each member of the Committee may not be an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and must otherwise satisfy the standards for independence of an audit committee member of an investment company issuer as set forth in Rule 10A-3(b) (taking into account any exceptions to those requirements set forth in such rule) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and under applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). Each member of the Committee must be "financially literate" (or must become so within a reasonable time after his or her appointment to the Committee) and at least one member of the Committee must have "accounting or related financial management expertise," in each case as the Board interprets such qualification in its business judgment under NYSE listing standards. 
Responsibilities and Duties 
The Committee's policies and procedures shall remain flexible to facilitate the Committee's ability to react to changing conditions and to generally discharge its functions. The following describe areas of attention in broad terms. The Committee shall: 
1. Determine the selection, retention or termination of the Fund's independent auditors based on an evaluation of their independence and the nature and performance of the audit and any permitted non-audit services. Decisions by the Committee concerning the selection, retention or termination of the independent auditors shall be submitted to the Board for ratification in accordance with the requirements of Section 32(a) of the Investment Company Act. The Fund's independent auditors must report directly to the Committee, which shall be responsible for resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditors relating to financial reporting. 
A-2 
2. To consider the independence of the Fund's independent auditors at least annually, and in connection therewith receive on a periodic basis formal written disclosures and letters from the independent auditors as required by the applicable rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"). 
3. To the extent required by applicable regulations, pre-approve (i) all audit and permitted non-audit services rendered by the independent auditors to the Fund and (ii) all non-audit services rendered by the independent auditors to the Fund's investment advisers (including sub-advisers) and to certain of the investment advisers' affiliates. 
The Committee may implement policies and procedures by which such services are approved other than by the full Committee. 
4. Review and approve the fees charged by the independent auditors to the Fund, the investment advisers and certain affiliates of the investment advisers for audit, audit- related and permitted non-audit services. 
5. If and to the extent that the Fund intends to have employees, set clear policies for the hiring by the Fund of employees or former employees of the Fund's independent auditors. 
6. Obtain and review at least annually a report from the independent auditors describing (i) the accounting firm's internal quality-control procedures and (ii) any material issues raised (a) by the accounting firm's most recent internal quality-control review or peer review or (b) by any governmental or other professional inquiry or investigation performed within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to address any such issues. 
7. Review with the Fund's independent auditors arrangements for and the scope of the annual audit and any special audits, including the form of any opinion proposed to be rendered to the Board and shareholders of the Fund. 
8. Meet with management and the independent auditors to review and discuss the Fund's annual audited financial statements, including a review of any specific disclosures of management's discussion of the Fund's investment performance; and, with respect to the Fund's audited financial statements, discuss with the independent auditors matters required by the applicable rules of the PCAOB and any other matters required to be reported to the Committee under applicable law; and provide a statement whether, based on its review of the Fund's audited financial statements, the Committee recommends to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report. 
A-3 
Meet with management to review and discuss the Fund's unaudited financial statements included in the semi-annual report, including, if any, a review of any specific disclosure of management's discussion of the Fund's investment performance. 
9. Discuss with management and the independent auditors the Fund's unaudited financial statements. 
10. Review with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties encountered in the course of their audit work and management's responses thereto. 
11. Review with management and, as applicable, with the independent auditors the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies, practices and internal controls, management's guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including the effect on the Fund of any recommendation of changes in accounting principles or practices by management or the independent auditors. 
12. Discuss with management any press releases discussing the Fund's investment performance and other financial information about the Fund, as well as any financial information provided by management to analysts or rating agencies. The Committee may discharge this responsibility by discussing the general types of information to be disclosed by the Fund and the form of presentation (i.e., a case-by-case review is not required) and need not discuss in advance each such release of information. 
13. Establish procedures for (i) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Fund regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters; and (ii) the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Fund, the Fund's investment advisers, administrator, principal underwriter (if any) or any other provider of accounting-related services for the investment advisers of concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. 
14. Investigate or initiate the investigation of any improprieties or suspected improprieties in the Fund's accounting operations or financial reporting. 
15. Review with counsel legal and regulatory matters that have a material impact on the Fund's financial and accounting reporting policies and practices or its internal controls. 
16. Report to the Board on a regular basis (at least annually) on the Committee's activities. 
A-4 
17. Perform such other functions consistent with this Charter, the Agreement and Declaration of Trust, Articles of Incorporation and/or Bylaws applicable to the Fund, and applicable law or regulation, as the Committee or the Board deems necessary or appropriate. 
The Committee may delegate any portion of its authority and responsibilities as set forth in this Charter to a subcommittee of one or more members of the Committee. 
Meetings 
At least annually, the Committee shall meet separately with the independent auditors and separately with the representatives of Fund management responsible for the financial and accounting operations of the Fund. The Committee shall hold other regular or special meetings as and when it deems necessary or appropriate. 
Outside Resources and Assistance from Management 
The appropriate officers of the Fund shall provide or arrange to provide such information, data and services as the Committee may request. The Committee shall have the authority to engage at the Fund's expense independent counsel and other experts and consultants whose expertise the Committee considers necessary to carry out its responsibilities. The Fund shall provide for, or arrange for the provision of, appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, for the payment of: (i) compensation of the Fund's independent auditors for the issuance of an audit report relating to the Fund's financial statements or the performance of other audit, review or attest services for the Fund; (ii) compensation of independent legal counsel or other advisers retained by the Committee; and (iii) ordinary administrative expenses of the Committee that are necessary or appropriate in fulfilling its purposes or carrying out its responsibilities under this Charter. 
Annual Evaluations 
The Committee shall review and reassess the adequacy of this Charter at least annually and recommend any changes to the Board. In addition, the performance of the Committee shall be reviewed at least annually.

Nominating Committee Charter 
PIMCO Managed Accounts Trust and 
PIMCO Sponsored Closed-End Funds 
PIMCO Sponsored Interval Funds 
The Boards of Directors/Trustees (the "Boards") of each Trust and respective series thereof (each Trust or series, a "Fund") have adopted this Charter to govern the activities of the Nominating Committee (the "Committee") of each Board. 
Statement of Purpose and Responsibility 
The primary purpose and responsibility of each Committee is the screening and nomination of candidates for election to the Board as independent Directors/Trustees. 
Organization and Governance 
Each Committee shall be comprised of as many Directors/Trustees as the Board shall determine, but in any event not fewer than two (2) Directors/Trustees. Each Committee must consist entirely of Board members who are not "interested persons" of the relevant Funds, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Board may remove or replace any member of the Committee at any time in its sole discretion. 
One or more members of a Committee may be designated by the Board as the Committee's chairman or co-chairman, as the case may be. 
A Committee will not have regularly scheduled meetings. Committee meetings shall be held as and when the Committee or the Board determines necessary or appropriate in accordance with the Fund's Bylaws. 
Qualifications for Director/Trustee Nominees 
A Director/Trustee candidate must have a college degree or equivalent business experience. The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Director/Trustee candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) ability, judgment and expertise and (v) overall diversity of the Board's composition. 
B-1 
Identification of Nominees 
In identifying potential nominees for a Board, the Committee may consider candidates recommended by the following sources: (i) the Fund's current Directors/Trustees; (ii) the Fund's officers; (iii) the Fund's investment adviser or sub- advisers; (iv) shareholders of the Fund (see below); and (v) any other source the Committee deems to be appropriate. The Committee may, but is not required to, retain a third party search firm at the Fund's expense to identify potential candidates. 
Consideration of Candidates Recommended By Shareholders 
A Committee will consider and evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by shareholders on the same basis as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. Appendix A (for PIMCO Managed Accounts Trust and PIMCO Sponsored Interval Funds) and Appendix B (for the PIMCO Sponsored Closed-End Funds) to this Charter, as they may be amended from time to time by a Committee, set forth procedures that must be followed by shareholders to submit properly a nominee candidate to the Committee (recommendations not properly submitted in accordance with Appendix A or Appendix B (as applicable) will not be considered by the Committee). 
Recommendation of Candidates to the Board 
A Committee will recommend to the Board the Directors/Trustees candidates that it deems qualified to serve as independent directors/trustees on the Board. To the extent practicable, the Committee will rank such potential nominees for the Board in order of preference. 
B-2 
Appendix A 
Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates for PIMCO Managed Accounts Trust and PIMCO Sponsored Interval Funds 
A shareholder of a Fund must follow the following procedures in order to submit properly a nominee recommendation for the Committee's consideration. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  The shareholder must submit any such recommendation (a "Shareholder Recommendation") in writing to a  Fund, to the attention of the Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Fund. Once each quarter, if any Shareholder Recommendations have been received by the Secretary during the quarter, the Secretary will inform the  Committee of the new Shareholder Recommendations. Because the Fund does not hold annual or other regular meetings of shareholders for the purpose of electing Trustees, the Committee will accept Shareholder Recommendations on a continuous basis.   
[END TABLE]

2.  All Shareholder Recommendations properly submitted to a Fund will be held by the Secretary until such time as  (i) the Committee convenes to consider candidates to fill Board vacancies or newly created Board positions (a "Trustee Consideration Meeting") or (ii) the Committee instructs the Secretary to discard a Shareholder Recommendation  following a Trustee Consideration Meeting or an Interim Evaluation (as defined below).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  At a Trustee Consideration Meeting, the Committee will consider each Shareholder Recommendation then held by  the Secretary. Following a Trustee Consideration Meeting, the Committee may instruct the Secretary to discard any or all of the Shareholder Recommendations currently held by the Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  A Committee may, in its discretion and at any time, convene to conduct an evaluation of validly submitted  Shareholder Recommendations (each such meeting, an "Interim Evaluation") for the purpose of determining which Shareholder Recommendations will be considered at the next Trustee Consideration Meeting. Following an Interim Evaluation, the  Committee may instruct the Secretary to discard any or all of the Shareholder Recommendations currently held by the Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  The Shareholder Recommendation must include: (i) a statement in writing setting forth (A) the name,  date of birth, business address, residence address and nationality of the person recommended by the shareholder (the "candidate"); (B) the number of shares of (and class, if any) of the Fund(s) owned of record or beneficially by the  candidate, as reported to such shareholder by the candidate; (C) any other information regarding the

Dated August 23, 2018 
The Audit Oversight Committees (the "Committee") oversee the Funds' financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Trustees/Directors of each Fund (the "Board") and operate under a written Charter adopted by the Board. The Committee meets with each Fund's management ("Management") and independent registered public accounting firm and reports the results of its activities to the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. In connection with the Committee's and independent accountant's responsibilities, Management has advised that the Funds' financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with Management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Statements on Auditing Standard No. 61 (SAS 61). SAS 61 requires the independent registered public accounting firm to communicate to the Committee matters including, if applicable: 1) methods used to account for significant unusual transactions; 2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus; 3) the process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates and the basis for the auditor's conclusions regarding the reasonableness of those estimates; and 4) disagreements with Management over the application of accounting principles and certain other matters. 
With respect to each Fund, the Committee has received the written disclosure and the letter from PwC required by Rule 3526 of the Public Company

 Accounting Oversight Board (requiring registered public accounting firms to make written disclosure to and discuss with the Committee various matters relating to the auditor's independence), and has discussed with PwC their independence. The Committee has also reviewed the aggregate fees billed by PwC for professional services rendered to each Fund and, to the extent applicable with respect to each Fund's reporting period, for non-audit services provided to Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), the Funds' investment manager, and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with PIMCO that provided services to each Fund during its reporting period. As part of this review, the Committee considered, in addition to other practices and requirements relating to selection of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, whether the provision of such non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. 
Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Committee presents this Report to the Board and recommends that (1) the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 be included in the Funds' Annual Report to shareholders for such fiscal year, (2) such Annual Report be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, if applicable, the New York Stock Exchange, and (3) PwC be reappointed as the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

Exhibit C-2 to Proxy Statement 
Report of Audit Oversight Committees of the Boards of Trustees of 
PIMCO Corporate & Income Strategy Fund (PCN) 
PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund (PTY) 
PIMCO High Income Fund (PHK) 
PIMCO Income Strategy Fund (PFL) 
PIMCO Income Strategy Fund II (PFN) 
(each, a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") 
Dated September 25, 2018 
The Audit Oversight Committees (the "Committee") oversee the Funds' financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Trustees of each Fund (the "Board") and operate under a written Charter adopted by the Board. The Committee meets with each Fund's management ("Management") and independent registered public accounting firm and reports the results of its activities to the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. In connection with the Committee's and independent accountant's responsibilities, Management has advised that the Funds' financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 were prepared in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with Management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Statements on Auditing Standard No. 61 (SAS 61). SAS 61 requires the independent registered public accounting firm to communicate to the Committee matters including, if applicable: 1) methods used to account for significant unusual transactions; 2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus; 3) the process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates and the basis for the auditor's conclusions regarding the reasonableness of those estimates; and 4) disagreements with Management over the application of accounting principles and certain other matters. 
With respect to each Fund, the Committee has received the written disclosure and the letter from PwC required by Rule 3526 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (requiring registered public accounting firms to 
C-2-1 
 make written disclosure to and discuss with the Committee various matters relating to the auditor's independence), and has discussed with PwC their independence. The Committee has also reviewed the aggregate fees billed by PwC for professional services rendered to each Fund and, to the extent applicable with respect to each Fund's reporting period, for non-audit services provided to Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), the Funds' investment manager and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with PIMCO that provided services to each Fund during its reporting period. As part of this review, the Committee considered, in addition to other practices and requirements relating to selection of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, whether the provision of such non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC. 
Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Committee presents this Report to the Board and recommends that (1) the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 be included in the Funds' Annual Report to shareholders for such fiscal year, (2) such Annual Report be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, and (3) PwC be reappointed as the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019.
