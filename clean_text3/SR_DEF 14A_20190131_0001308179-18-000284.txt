Dear fellow shareholders and employees,
Thank you for your investment in Spire and for the confidence you have placed in the Board to oversee your interests in the Company.
Strategy
The Board considers it a privilege to be stewards of this Company, playing an essential role in overseeing Spire's long-term growth strategy. At our annual Board strategy session and at meetings throughout the year, we leverage our diverse backgrounds, broad-based experience and unique insights into strategy development and execution to guide Spire's strategic imperatives, key priorities and long-range plans. We are steadfastly focused on achieving results and delivering on our promises.
Diversity of thought, experience and background
As Spire's long-term strategy evolves, so do the skills, qualifications and experience our Board looks for in its director nominees. We regularly review the mix of skills, qualifications and experience of our current directors and seek to identify individuals who can help us shape Spire's long-term growth strategy.
As part of this effort, we strive to maintain an appropriate balance of experience, tenure and diversity on the Board. Refreshing the Board is a priority, because new directors bring new perspectives and ideas. At the same time, the Board believes it is equally important to benefit from the valuable experience and continuity that longer-serving directors bring.
"We strive to maintain an appropriate balance of experience, tenure and diversity on the Board."
Commitment to strong corporate governance
Our Board has adopted comprehensive corporate governance standards and policies to govern our activities and practices and to facilitate accountability for our actions. We believe strong corporate governance and an ethical culture are important drivers of financial integrity and sustainable performance that, in turn, lead to investor confidence. As directors, we are fully accountable to you, the shareholders, and ultimately, we believe that this accountability is integral to our success.
On behalf of our Board of Directors, thank you again for your investment and for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Edward L. Glotzbach
Chairman of the Board   Spire Inc.

Spire's fiscal year 2018 corporate performance
The following table provides information on the Company's performance in the last two fiscal years, which was a critical consideration in the Company's determination of appropriate executive compensation. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company reported an increase in consolidated net income to $214.2 million from $161.6 million for fiscal year 2017. Net income and earnings per share are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP"). Management also uses the non-GAAP measures of net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share when internally evaluating and reporting results of operations as discussed on pages 29 and 30 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 (the "2018 10-K"). Net economic earnings for 2018 were $183.7 million, up from $167.6 million for 2017.
The increase in net income was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and much stronger results from the Gas Marketing segment. The net economic earnings improvement reflects increases for both the Gas Marketing segment and the Gas Utility segment. The results are discussed further beginning on page 32 of the 2018 10-K.
Our 2018 results
Executive compensation
The Company is committed to its pay-for-performance philosophy. Basic net economic earnings per share is the key metric used to determine funding under our Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") in 2018. The Company also emphasizes pay-for-performance by placing most of the executives' target total direct compensation ("TTDC") at risk through the annual and equity incentive plans. TTDC includes the current base salary, the 2018 target AIP opportunity and the market value of the equity awards made during fiscal year 2018. Further, the largest portion of incentive pay, which is represented by the equity incentive award, focuses on long-term performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Corporate social    responsibility During fiscal year 2017, we established our Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") Council, which supports the implementation of the Company's promise to answer every challenge, advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy. In last year's proxy statement, we noted that we planned to issue our first-ever CSR report in 2018 and that our report would summarize our activities and performance in the area of sustainability, including how we are operating responsibly from an environmental, social and governance perspective. So that we may issue a report that includes fiscal 2018 information, we have pushed back our planned issuance to the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

Governance
Corporate governance at a glance
Board and committee structure
Our Board currently consists of nine directors, eight of whom are independent. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the chair may be an officer or may be an independent member of the Board, at the discretion of the Board. The Board believes it should be free to use its business judgment to determine what it believes is best for the Company in light of all the circumstances. Mr. Glotzbach is currently chairman of the Board.
Ms. Sitherwood, as chief executive officer, focuses on setting the strategy for the Company, overseeing daily operations, developing our leaders and promoting employee engagement throughout the Company. As chairman, Mr. Glotzbach leads the Board in the performance of its duties by working with the chief executive officer to establish meeting agendas and content, engaging with the leadership team between meetings and providing overall guidance as to the Board's views and perspective.
During the 2018 fiscal year, there were seven meetings of our Board of Directors. All directors attended 75 percent or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and applicable committee meetings, and all directors attended the last annual meeting of shareholders.
The standing committees of the Board of Directors include the audit, compensation, corporate governance and strategy committees.
Qualifications required of all directors
The Board requires that each director be a person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field and have the ability to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company. Generally, the Board looks for persons who evidence personal characteristics of the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values; an inquiring and independent mind and practical wisdom and mature judgment; and expertise that is useful to the Company and complementary to the background and experience of other Board members.
In addition, the Board conducts interviews of potential director candidates to assess intangible qualities, including the individual's ability to ask difficult questions and to work collegially and collaboratively. The Board does not have a specific diversity policy, but considers diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, cultural background and professional experience in evaluating candidates for Board membership. Diversity is important because the Board believes that a variety of points of view contribute to a more effective decision-making process.
When recommending director nominees for election by shareholders, the Board and the corporate governance committee focus on how the experience and skill set of each director nominee complements those of fellow directors to create a balanced Board with diverse viewpoints and deep expertise.
Board evaluation process
How we evaluate our Board and committee performance
Questionnaire Each director completes and submits a written questionnaire for the Board and each committee on which the director serves, providing numeric ratings and feedback regarding various aspects of the composition and performance of the Board and the committees. Results shared The results are reviewed and assembled into documents for the Board and for each committee by the corporate secretary and included in the Board and committee meeting materials. Feedback incorporated The Board and each committee reviews and discusses its respective results and determines whether it is appropriate to make membership or process changes. 
How we evaluate our directors
Each year, the corporate governance committee and Board engages in discussions regarding whether the Board possesses the skills and experiences that it needs to provide oversight and direction to the business. As part of this discussion, the directors are asked to provide specific input regarding the individual directors whose terms expire at the next annual meeting.
The feedback is shared with the individual directors and serves as the basis for the Board determining whether to include these directors as a nominee in the proxy statement.
Board committees and their membership

Risk oversight
Management is responsible for assessing and managing risk exposures on a day-to-day basis, and the Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk management. In its oversight role, the Board and its committees ensure that the Company promotes a risk-aware culture and decision-making process. Several of the Board's committees assist the Board in its risk oversight: the audit committee oversees the financial reporting, cybersecurity and related risks; the compensation committee oversees the compensation and pension plan funding risks; and the strategy committee oversees the Company's long-range plan, investment strategies, capital structure and financial needs, including leverage, liquidity and funding sources and related matters in the context of the corporate strategy and the risks related to the Company's corporate development strategies, capital structure and financial needs.
At the management level, the Company has an officer charged with overseeing the implementation of the enterprise risk management process at the Company. Her efforts are supported by a disclosure committee that meets at least quarterly and assists in identifying, prioritizing and monitoring risks. Because of the use of commodity-based derivatives by three of the Company's subsidiaries, there is also a smaller risk committee that focuses on the risks and exposures in the commodity-based derivatives markets.
Compensation risk assessment
During the past year, management, with oversight by the compensation committee, conducted a risk assessment of its overall compensation program. This risk assessment included consideration of the mix and amount of compensation:
The assessment also considered the risk mitigation impact of stock ownership guidelines and retention requirements, the use of multiple types of metrics, the caps set on incentive compensation, the role of the compensation committee and its independent consultant as well as the use of the internal audit department to assess documentation of performance on the incentive-based metrics. Management regularly assesses risks related to our compensation programs, including our executive compensation programs. At the compensation committee's direction, its independent compensation consultant Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC and management provide ongoing information regarding compensation factors that could mitigate or encourage excessive risk-taking.
Management determined, and the committee agreed, that the risks relative to the Company's compensation policies and practices would not result in a material adverse effect on the Company.
Director independence
The Board of Directors believes that a majority of the directors should be independent and determined that the following members were independent: Borer, Fogarty, Glotzbach, Jones, Newberry, Schwartz, Stupp and Van Lokeren. Ms. Sitherwood, president and chief executive officer, is the only non-independent member of the Board. In determining the independence of directors, the Board found that none of the directors, other than Ms. Sitherwood, have any material relationship with the Company other than as a director. In making these determinations, the Board considers all facts and circumstances as well as certain prescribed standards of independence, which are included with our Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.SpireEnergy.com in the Investors/Governance section. The Director Independence Standards adopted by the Board largely reflect the New York Stock Exchange standards, except that our adopted standards provide that the Board need not consider material the provision of natural gas service to any director or immediate family member of the director or director-related company pursuant to the tariffed rates of the Company's utilities.
The independent members of the Board meet in executive session at least quarterly, which sessions are led by Mr. Glotzbach, the current chairman of the Board. Each quarter, the chairman solicits from other Board members topics for discussion in those sessions. Topics include, from time to time, the performance of the chief executive officer, executive succession planning, executive compensation matters and the Company's strategy.
All of the members of the audit, compensation and corporate governance committees are independent under our Director Independence Standards as well as under the standards of the New York Stock Exchange.
Corporate governance documents
Our key corporate governance documents include:
All of these documents, other than the Policy Regarding the Approval of Independent Registered Public Accountant Provision of Audit and Non-Audit Services, are available at www.SpireEnergy.com in the Investors/ Governance section, and a copy of any of these documents will be sent to any shareholder upon request.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board generally conducts itself in accordance with its Corporate Governance Guidelines. The guidelines, among other matters, provide:
Related Party Transaction Policy and Procedures
We have adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy and Procedures, which is used by our corporate governance committee to determine whether to pre-approve transactions involving more than $100,000 with our directors, executive officers, five percent or greater shareholders, and their immediate family members. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the committee will decide whether or not to approve the transaction and will approve only those transactions that it determines to be in the best interest of the Company. If the Company becomes aware of an existing transaction with a related party that has not been approved under the policy, the matter will be referred to the committee. The committee will evaluate all options available including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. While the committee generally reviews and considers approval or ratification of related party transactions, the Board has delegated to the corporate governance committee chair the authority to pre-approve or ratify, as applicable, any related party transaction involving an aggregate amount of less than $100,000. The policy also includes certain transactions that are deemed pre-approved because they do not pose a significant risk of a conflict of interest. Such pre-approved transactions include the provision of natural gas service to any of the related parties by our utility subsidiaries in accordance with their respective tariffed rates and those transactions at such a level as not to be material to the Company or the related party. There were no related party transactions in fiscal year 2018 requiring committee action.
Policy regarding the approval of independent registered public accountant provision of audit and non-audit services
Consistent with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements regarding accountant independence, the audit committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence, in fact and appearance, of our independent registered public accountant. To this end, the audit committee adopted a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent accountant. Under the policy, the committee or its designated member must pre-approve services prior to commencement of the specified service. Any pre-approvals by the designated member between meetings will be reported to the audit committee at its next meeting. The requests for pre-approval are submitted to the audit committee or its designated member, as applicable, by both the independent accountant and the Company's chief financial officer or designee and must include (a) a written description of the services to be provided in detail sufficient to enable the audit committee to make an informed decision with regard to each proposed service and (b) a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's ("PCAOB") rules on auditor independence. The pre-approval fee levels are established and reviewed by the audit committee periodically, primarily through a quarterly report provided to the audit committee by management. Any proposed services exceeding these levels require specific pre-approval by the audit committee. Generally, after review of the pre-approved services incurred each quarter, the audit committee resets the pre-approval dollar level. At each regularly scheduled audit committee meeting, the audit committee shall review the following:
Shareholder nominee recommendations and nominee qualifications
Shareholders who wish to recommend nominees to the corporate governance committee should make their submission to the committee by October 2 preceding the annual meeting by submitting it to:
Corporate Governance Committee Chair  c/o Spire Inc.  700 Market Street  St. Louis, MO 63101  Attn: Corporate Secretary
Candidates properly recommended by shareholders will be evaluated by the committee using the same criteria as applied to other candidates as described on page 14.
Correspondence with the Board
Those who desire to communicate with the independent directors should send correspondence addressed to:
Chairman of the Board  c/o Spire Inc.  700 Market Street  St. Louis, MO 63101  Attn: Corporate Secretary
All appropriate correspondence is forwarded directly to the chairman of the Board. The Company does not, however, forward spam, sales, marketing or mass mailing materials; product or service complaints or inquiries; new product or service suggestions; resumes and other forms of job inquiries; or surveys. However, any filtered information is available to any director upon request.
Directors' compensation
The corporate governance committee periodically reviews director compensation relative to data of the Company's comparator group provided by the compensation committee's independent consultant, which was Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC during fiscal year 2018. The basic retainers and fees payable in fiscal year 2018 are set forth below. No retainers or fees are paid to directors who are executives or employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Board and committee fees and retainers
The amount and form of the annual Board retainer are fixed from time to time by vote of the Board. For 2018, the annual retainer was $185,000, of which $85,000 was payable in cash and $100,000 was payable in shares of our common stock. The number of shares is determined by dividing $100,000 by the average closing stock price of our common stock during the 30-day period preceding the grant date and rounding to the nearest ten shares. There are no additional per-meeting fees. Beginning February 1, 2019, the annual Board retainer will be $205,000, of which $95,000 will be payable in cash and $110,000 will be payable in shares of our common stock; the Board chair annual retainer will be $100,000; and the compensation committee chair retainer will be $12,500. The Board has imposed a limit of $400,000 per director on the annual amount of the restricted stock retainer that could be approved by the Board for payment to independent directors. The table below discloses the compensation paid or earned by all those who served as Company directors in fiscal year 2018. Not included in the table is the Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors in which participation and benefits have been frozen since November 1, 2002. Under that plan, a non-employee director who had at least five years of service as a director as of November 1, 2002 qualified for an annual payment after retirement in an amount equal to the Board retainer at November 1, 2002 ($18,000), with such payments being made for the longer of 10 years or life. The only current director eligible for benefits under the plan is Ms. Van Lokeren.
The table below provides more details relative to the restricted stock awards made under the Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that have not yet vested:
Stock awards to directors were made under the Company's Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, amended and approved by shareholders in January 2009, until February 1, 2012. Under these awards, participants receive cash dividends on the Company's common stock and may vote the shares awarded even while the shares are restricted, but the restricted shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred, except in accordance with the terms of the plan. Directors Glotzbach, Stupp and Van Lokeren are fully vested in their awards under the plan. The table below shows the vesting schedule for Director Newberry's shares.
The directors are eligible to participate under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and no further grants have been or will be made under the Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. As noted above, currently each non-employee director is awarded an annual fixed-value stock grant in the amount of $100,000. This amount will increase to $110,000 in 2019.
Beneficial ownership of Spire common stock
The following table shows, as of November 1, 2018, the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by (i) each person known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Company's common stock, (ii) each current director and director nominee, (iii) each named executive officer listed in the "Summary compensation table" and (iv) all directors, nominees and executive officers as a group.
Amount and nature of ownership
*Less than one percent.
The following table sets forth aggregate information regarding the Company's equity compensation plan as of September 30, 2018.
Information on the above-referenced equity incentive plan is set forth in Note 2, Stock-based Compensation, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2018 10-K.
Stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements for non-employee directors and executive officers
To provide a direct link between director, executive officer and shareholder interests, the Company adopted a stock ownership policy. The table below indicates the number of shares directors and executive officers are expected to own under the policy.
Directors must retain 90 percent and executive officers must retain 75 percent of the net shares awarded to them under Company plans until they meet the stock ownership requirements. All directors and executive officers are currently in compliance with the stock ownership policy.
Stock ownership guidelines
Section 16(a) beneficial ownership reporting compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors and executive officers to file reports of holdings and transactions in Spire shares with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Based on our records and information, in fiscal year 2018, our directors and executive officers met all applicable SEC reporting requirements.
Proposal 2: Advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are seeking your approval of the Company's compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. Although the vote on this proposal is advisory and nonbinding, the compensation committee and Board will review the results of the vote and consider the collective views of our shareholders in future determinations concerning our executive compensation program generally and the compensation of our named executive officers in particular.
As noted in the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), the Company's philosophy is to pay for performance by making compensation decisions based on what promotes our corporate strategy, creates shareholder value and remains equitable for the Company, its employees and its shareholders. In the process of making these decisions, we also consider the types and levels of compensation in the marketplace. We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, which discusses in more detail our compensation policies and procedures. Throughout the year, our compensation committee assesses our compensation programs to ensure they are consistent with our pay philosophy. In determining how to vote on this proposal, please consider our compensation governance and pay structure:
The Board of Directors is asking shareholders to support the Company's named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement. The compensation committee and the Board of Directors believe the compensation program effectively implements the Company's compensation principles and policies, achieves the Company's compensation objectives, and aligns the interests of the executives and shareholders. Accordingly, the Board asks shareholders to cast a nonbinding vote "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and other related disclosures."

Executive summary
2018 Company performance
The compensation committee ("Committee") believes that the actions taken by the Company's chief executive officer ("CEO") and management team throughout fiscal year 2018 positively impacted the Company's results and positioned the Company for continued success.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company reported an increase in consolidated net income to $214.2 million from $161.6 million for fiscal year 2017. Net economic earnings for 2018 were $183.7 million ($3.73 per basic share), up from $167.6 million for 2017 ($3.57 per basic share).
Net income and earnings per share are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Management also uses the non-GAAP measures of net economic earnings and net economic earnings per share when internally evaluating and reporting results of operations as discussed on pages 29 and 30 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 (the "2018 10-K").
The increase in net income was primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and much stronger results from the Gas Marketing segment. The net economic earnings improvement reflects increases for both the Gas Marketing segment and the Gas Utility segment. The results are discussed further beginning on page 31 of the 2018 10-K.
Alignment of pay and performance
The graph below evidences the Company's commitment to the pay-for-performance philosophy as it compares the Company's basic net economic earnings per share to the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") amounts earned by the NEOs. Given that Mr. Geiselhart became an NEO for the first time for fiscal year 2017, the graph excludes his AIP amounts for the performance periods prior to such dates. However, the graph reflects AIP amounts for the NEO that preceded him in fiscal years 2013 through 2016.
Basic net economic earnings per share is the key metric used to determine funding under the Company's AIP. It is calculated like GAAP basic earnings per share except net income is replaced by net economic earnings and the weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted to exclude the impact, in the fiscal year of issuance, of shares issued to finance acquisitions that have yet to be included in net economic earnings. The earnings in the graph are based on operations for the respective years reflected in the graph. Further explanation of net economic earnings is provided on pages 31 and 32 of this proxy statement.
The Company also emphasizes pay for performance by placing a majority of the NEOs' target total direct compensation ("TTDC") at risk through the annual and long-term incentive plans. TTDC includes base salary at the end of fiscal year 2018, the 2018 target AIP opportunity, and the market value (target shares multiplied by grant date stock price) of awards made under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan ("EIP") during fiscal year 2018. Furthermore, the equity incentive award, the largest portion of incentive pay, focuses on long-term performance. The graph to the right shows the mix of fixed (base pay) and at-risk (annual and long-term incentive) pay.
Compensation overview and philosophy
The Committee establishes the executive compensation philosophy and assists the Board in the development and oversight of all aspects of executive compensation.
Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy promotes our corporate strategy and creates shareholder value, while remaining equitable for the Company, its executives and its shareholders. The Committee believes that its compensation practices reflect a responsible pay-for-performance culture. The Committee seeks to deliver a total compensation package that balances short-term and longer-term compensation opportunities to ensure that the Company meets short-term objectives while continuing to produce value for its shareholders over the long term.
The Committee also promotes a competitive compensation program to attract, motivate and retain key executives. Each year, the Committee reviews the Company's pay program for its executive officers to evaluate total compensation in relation to the Company's peer group. The Company's compensation philosophy is to target total compensation in the median range of its peer comparator data, with actual pay dependent on Company results and the executive's performance, skills and experience.
Pay-for-Performance The compensation program should promote our corporate strategy and create shareholder value. Balance Annual and long-term incentive opportunities should reward the appropriate balance of short- and long-term financial, strategic and operational business results. Competitiveness The compensation program should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate a leadership team capable of maximizing Company performance.
The Committee considered the results of the advisory "say-on-pay" proposal in January 2018 when making compensation decisions. A majority (98 percent) of the votes cast approved the compensation program described in the Company's proxy statement. The considered judgment of the Committee, which included taking into account the support from the shareholder vote, was that no significant changes to the executive compensation program were warranted.
Best practices in executive compensation
Our executive compensation program reflects the following best practices, which ensure effective compensation governance and align interests between shareholders and executives.
Components of executive compensation
The table below provides the components and objectives of the Company's executive compensation program.

After reviewing market and peer group data, as well as other analysis from the Committee's independent compensation consultant, and considering the role, experience and expertise of each executive officer, the Committee determines the appropriate balance among the components of executive compensation in the total compensation package. Generally, the Committee determines whether to make certain market adjustments to base salaries and sets target opportunities under the annual and long-term incentive programs that, when combined, produce TTDC that is consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy.

Analysis of 2018 compensation decisions and actions
Base salary
In November 2017, the Committee approved merit increases to NEO salaries for fiscal year 2018. The Committee also approved a market adjustment to Mr. Geiselhart's salary. The salary increases for the NEOs are detailed above in the "Summary of 2018 compensation decisions for NEOs." The Committee determined that these salary adjustments properly reflected the NEOs' contributions to the successful business growth while continuing to focus within the NEOs' functional areas.
Annual incentive compensation
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board reviews and sets key performance metrics for the AIP based on the Company's business and strategic plan for the upcoming year. Actual payments to executives are then based on the fiscal year results of the Company and the business unit, if applicable, for which the executive performs services, as well as the executive's individual performance. The Committee, in collaboration with management, sets the targets for each metric described below, based on an analysis of prior years' performance and an intention to achieve growth in future years. Individual objectives are set for each NEO, with such objectives relating to the executive's functional area of responsibility and aligning with corporate strategy.
The following chart sets forth the 2018 AIP targets as a percentage of base salary and the weightings of the various metrics for each NEO:
Corporate metric
The corporate metric used in determining the AIP awards evaluates the Company's financial success for the fiscal year. The metric used is basic net economic earnings per share ("NEEPS"). Net economic earnings exclude from net income the after-tax impacts of fair value accounting and timing adjustments associated with energy-related transactions, the impacts of acquisitions, divestiture and restructuring activities, and the largely non-cash impacts of other non-recurring or unusual items, such as certain regulatory, legislative or GAAP standard-setting actions.
Management believes that excluding these items provides a useful representation of the economic impact of actual settled transactions and overall results of ongoing operations. These internal non-GAAP operating metrics should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP measures. More information regarding net economic earnings can be found in the 2018 10-K in the Non-GAAP Measures section of our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The table below shows the level of performance for the corporate metric for fiscal year 2018.
Business unit metric
The business unit metric relates to the portion of the business over which an executive has the most control and influence. Mr. Lindsey, as president and chief executive officer of Spire Missouri Inc. and chief executive officer of Spire Alabama Inc., Spire Gulf Inc., and Spire Mississippi Inc., was assigned the Gas Utility business unit. The other NEOs have not been assigned a business unit metric for AIP purposes.
The metric used to measure Gas Utility performance is operating income. Business unit operating income for AIP purposes removes the impacts related to acquisition, divestiture and restructuring activities and other non-recurring items. The table below shows the level of performance for the business unit metric for fiscal year 2018.
Individual performance metric
Individual performance measures are generally subjective and relate to the manner in which the executive accomplishes the individual objectives set for that executive during the year. This allows for assessment of the executive's leadership role in furthering the values and culture of the Company as well as contributing to its long-term success.
Performance status is reviewed periodically during the year, and the Committee reviews the final evaluation shortly after the end of the fiscal year but awaits the audit results before approving the final payouts. Some discretionary adjustments may be applied, where appropriate, and there are instances where objectives may be modified during the year, when warranted.
Fiscal year 2018 AIP results
After evaluating the performance of the Company and the NEOs in fiscal year 2018, the Committee approved annual incentive awards. The awards for the NEOs reflected that the 2018 fiscal year was another successful and transformative year for the Company. Performance remains high across our leadership team, as evidenced by their leadership in the Company's continued execution of its strategy.
As a result of the performance on the metrics described herein, the NEOs earned the following amounts under the AIP.
Long-term incentive compensation
The Committee approves equity grants with approximately 75 percent of the value of long-term incentives being awarded in performance-contingent stock units ("PCSUs") and approximately 25 percent of the value being awarded in time-based restricted shares ("TBRSs").
Grants made in fiscal year 2018
On November 8, 2017, the Committee authorized the grants of TBRSs ("2018 TBRSs") and PCSUs ("2018 PCSUs") to 25 officers, including all of the NEOs. The grants were made on November 15, 2017. Both the 2018 TBRSs and the 2018 PCSUs are included in the "Grants of plan-based awards" table in this proxy statement.
The 2018 TBRSs fully vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if the recipient continues employment with the Company through that date. Quarterly dividends are paid on TBRSs during the vesting period.
The 2018 PCSUs consist of stock units that become eligible to vest after a three-year performance period is complete and the Company's average NEEPS over the performance period exceed the annualized declared dividend per share for the common stock as of the award date ("Dividend Related Earnings"). If there are no Dividend Related Earnings, the units and related dividend equivalents are forfeited. If the Company meets the Dividend Related Earnings metric, the actual number of units that vest is determined by the Committee based on the factors described below.
The factors that dictate the vesting levels of the 2018 PCSUs are average NEEPS over fiscal years 2018-2020 and a Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") metric that compares the Company's TSR performance to its peer group (described herein on page 34), with these metrics each weighted at 50 percent.
Performance under the NEEPS metric is measured by calculating the three-year average of the Company's NEEPS. In the first year of the performance period, NEEPS was $3.73 on a non-diluted basis. NEEPS for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 will be added to the 2018 NEEPS amount for calculating the three-year average NEEPS to determine if performance at any level has been achieved.
These metrics may be achieved at threshold, target or high performance levels, as evaluated by the Committee. The threshold level produces vesting of 50 percent of the target level of stock units for each metric. The high performance level produces vesting of 200 percent of the target level of stock units for each metric.
Dividend equivalents on PCSUs will accrue throughout the performance period and will only be paid to the participants in proportion to the number of shares actually earned at vesting. No interest is paid on the accrued dividends.
The performance targets set for EIP grants are considered to be confidential and competitive information, particularly to the extent the performance targets relate to projected Company financial data and strategy, neither of which the Company publicly discloses. The Committee believes that targeted levels of performance for the EIP grants are challenging and will not be achieved all of the time. High performance levels will be difficult to achieve and will require exceptional performance. The following chart shows the vesting levels for prior fiscal years as a percentage of target.
With regard to the Committee's certification of performance, the Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, reviews and discusses the calculations of the metrics to verify compliance with the terms of the award agreement and determines the level of performance achieved and the number of shares earned. The Committee then approves a resolution that reflects the Committee's determinations. The PCSUs will vest only upon the Committee's certification as to performance.
Grants that vested in 2018
On November 18, 2015, the Committee authorized the grant of TBRSs and PCSUs to 23 current officers, including all NEOs. The grants were made on December 1, 2015. These TBRSs vested on December 1, 2018.
The PCSUs were granted for the performance period of fiscal years 2016-2018. The vesting of those awards was based upon the three-year average NEEPS metric and the TSR metric based on the peer group in place at the time of grant. TSR for the Company and peer group was calculated as follows:
Total share value at the end of the performance period is calculated as the average share price for the last quarter of the performance period (July 1, 2018-September 30, 2018) plus the value of reinvested dividends. Average share price immediately prior to the grant is calculated using the average share price for the last quarter immediately prior to the grant (July 1, 2015-September 30, 2015).
In reviewing the Company's performance over the period and in accordance with the terms of the EIP, the Committee evaluated the NEEPS metric by averaging the NEEPS for each of fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The metrics and actual performance for the 2018 PCSUs were as follows:
TSR performance for the three-year period was low due to the consolidating nature of the natural gas industry. The Company's peer group has reduced in size each year due to acquisitions, which may cause results that do not fully reflect the financial success achieved by the Company and its shareholders.
On November 7, 2018, the Committee certified these performance outcomes, resulting in a total of 20,138 PCSUs vesting (representing 51 percent of target) for the NEOs. A total of 13,290 TBRSs also vested for the NEOs over the last year. The table below shows the number of PCSUs and TBRSs that vested for each NEO.
Grants that vested December 1, 2018
Executive compensation governance
Roles in executive compensation
The Committee implements and administers the Company's compensation philosophy and engages an independent compensation consultant to provide market reference perspective and to serve as an advisor. The compensation consultant serves at the request of, and reports directly to, the Committee and does not perform other significant services for the Company.
The Committee determined that the compensation consultant is independent, and its work has not raised any conflicts of interest.
In fiscal year 2018, the Committee continued its retention of Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC ("Semler Brossy") to serve as its consultant. Semler Brossy is an independent firm, providing executive compensation consulting services to the Committee. Semler Brossy also provides consulting services to the corporate governance committee regarding non-employee director compensation. Semler Brossy reports to the Committee and attends all Committee meetings either in person or by telephone.
While the Committee receives advice on executive compensation from its compensation consultant, the Committee and the Board retain all decision-making authority to ensure that the decisions reflect the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy.
The table below outlines the roles and responsibilities of the various parties in determining and deciding executive compensation.

Compensation committee actions in 2018
The Committee's review of the Company's executive pay practices has continued to improve the integrity of our pay-for-performance philosophy, align the interests of our executive officers and shareholders and strengthen our governance commitment. In 2018, the Committee:
Competitive market compensation analysis
Each year, the Committee evaluates certain comparative data when determining executive compensation levels to help ensure that compensation opportunities being delivered to our executive officers are competitive within the industry markets in which the Company competes for talent. Although the Committee reviews the data to see how the Company's executive compensation levels compare to the median range of the Company's comparator peer group, decisions are not guided solely by such data, as the Committee's focus is to make compensation decisions uniquely appropriate for the Company and the individual executive officer.
To assist the Committee in its annual market review of executive officer compensation, the independent compensation consultant prepares an analysis of the market competitiveness of compensation for each executive officer. The independent compensation consultant's analysis includes a combination of survey and peer company pay information to establish competitive market rates for base salary and annual and long-term incentives for the executive officer positions. This allows the Committee to ensure our competitive market data is robust, reliable and objective on an ongoing basis. In making compensation decisions, the Committee uses:
Of the sources listed above, the Committee places more emphasis on the WTW Survey.
The WTW Survey is a proprietary third-party survey, and the specific identity of respondents for any given position is not provided to the Company. Because of the large variance in size among participating companies within the survey, the independent compensation consultant conducts analyses, including regression, to adjust the compensation data for differences in revenue and size. These adjustments are necessary to allow for appropriate size comparisons between our Company and the participating companies in the survey.
For each executive, the Committee determines whether target total compensation is sufficient to retain and motivate the executive. If adjustments are needed to create greater alignment with the Company's compensation philosophy, or to reflect unique circumstances at the Company, the Committee evaluates each component of compensation (base salary, short-term incentive and long-term incentive targets) to determine where such adjustments may be required. In addition, the Committee considers other subjective factors in its compensation decisions, such as individual performance, experience, future potential and expertise.
Use of peer group
Annually, the independent compensation consultant, along with the Company's finance leadership, reviews our peer group members and recommends a group composition that considers industry-appropriateness, business size and changes necessitated due to acquisitions and divestitures. This peer group is used as a secondary data point to assess executive compensation, as well as to evaluate the relative TSR metric for vesting of PCSUs. The table below shows our peers for fiscal year 2018, as well as a comparison of peer group members for fiscal years 2015-2017.
TSR has historically been determined by benchmarking the Company's performance against a specific set of gas utility peer companies. Over time, there has been a reduction in the numbers of peers in the peer set due to the consolidating nature of the natural gas industry.
The peer group used to determine the TSR results for the PCSUs that vested in 2018 has decreased as illustrated in the table below.
The text in orange below signifies companies that have been added to or removed from the peer group each year. These changes to the peer group are taken into account by the Committee at the time of vesting.

[END TABLE]
Termination and change in control
The Company believes it is important to provide officers certain compensation in the event of a termination after a change in control, particularly since it does not enter into employment agreements. In addition to the payments described below, the annual and long-term incentive benefits payable to the NEOs upon termination with or without a change in control are described in the "Potential payments upon termination or change in control" section later in this proxy statement.
Executive Severance Plan
Ms. Sitherwood and Mr. Lindsey participate in the Company's Executive Severance Plan. The Executive Severance Plan provides for a severance benefit if a participant's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the participant for good reason (such terms being defined in the plan). No payment will be made on account of a participant's death or disability.
The severance benefit is a lump sum payment equal to the participant's applicable percentage (200 percent for Ms. Sitherwood and 100 percent for Mr. Lindsey) of the participant's base salary, plus a cash payment equal to the estimated cost of continued medical, dental and vision benefits for a period of 24 months for Ms. Sitherwood and 12 months for Mr. Lindsey.
In the event of a qualifying termination following a change in control, the severance benefit will be a lump sum payment equal to the participant's applicable percentage (300 percent for Ms. Sitherwood and 200 percent for Mr. Lindsey) of the participant's base salary plus the participant's AIP target, plus a cash payment equal to the estimated cost of continued medical, dental and vision benefits for a period of 36 months for Ms. Sitherwood and 24 months for Mr. Lindsey.
The plan defines a change in control as (i) one or more persons acquiring 30 percent or more of the Company's outstanding shares; (ii) replacement of a majority of the Board by individuals whose nominations were not approved by a majority of the Board; (iii) consummation of a reorganization, merger or consolidation that results in the Company's shareholders no longer owning more than 50 percent of the voting power of the surviving entity's outstanding securities; or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or a sale of at least 80 percent of the Company's assets.
A participant must sign a Confidentiality, Non-Disparagement, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreement and must execute a release in order to receive a payment under the Executive Severance Plan.
Management Continuity Protection Plan
The Management Continuity Protection Plan ("MCPP") was adopted in 1991 and was most recently restated in 2005. Effective January 1, 2015, no new participants will enter the MCPP.
Of the NEOs, Messrs. Darrell, Rasche and Geiselhart were covered by the MCPP at fiscal year-end. The MCPP provides for the payment of benefits to officers in certain termination events after a change in control, which is defined as occurring when a person acquires more than 50 percent of the voting power of securities of the Company or if a person acquires between 30 percent and 50 percent of the voting power and the Board determines that a de facto change in control has occurred.
The MCPP provides for a lump-sum payment in an amount equal to the average W-2 compensation paid to a participant for the five-year period immediately preceding cessation of employment, multiplied by 2.99 for an executive vice president or 2.00 for the other officers.
The MCPP does not provide benefit payments to those participants who have reached normal retirement age of 65 and provides no benefits if the officer is terminated for cause. The MCPP limits the amount of the benefit payable to an amount equal to the participant's average monthly compensation for the five-year period immediately preceding the cessation of employment multiplied by the number of months until the date the participant would reach normal retirement age of 65.
If, after a change in control, a participant in the MCPP is terminated other than for cause, resigns or retires within 54 months in the case of any executive vice president, or within 42 months in the case of all other officers, then the participant is entitled to the lump sum amount described above. However, the amount is reduced for each month the participant remains employed by the Company starting with the seventh month after the change in control. The amount of the reduction is 1/48 per month for an executive vice president and 1/36 per month for all other officers.
Other Company-provided benefits
The Company believes retirement, health and welfare benefits serve an important role in the total compensation and benefits package offered to employees to assist in attracting and retaining key talent. The Company provides both Company-paid and voluntary health and welfare programs. The programs are reviewed periodically pursuant to the Company's intent to be competitive within the industry in terms of total compensation.
Retirement plans
The Company offers its employees a defined contribution 401(k) plan that provides a Company match for all employees, including the NEOs. All of the NEOs participated in the Spire Employee Savings Plan in 2018.
The NEOs participate in a qualified defined benefit retirement plan sponsored by Spire Missouri Inc. for its employees. Spire Missouri Inc. also provides NEOs with non-qualified supplemental retirement plan benefits. More details relative to these plans are included in the "Pension plan compensation" section later in this proxy statement.
Life insurance
The Company provides a life insurance benefit for Ms. Sitherwood in an amount equal to $500,000 while employed by the Company, and the Company provides a life insurance benefit for Messrs. Rasche, Lindsey, Darrell and Geiselhart equal to 200 percent of base salary, subject to a maximum of $1,500,000 while employed by the Company. Following retirement, the Company provides a life insurance benefit equal to: 50 percent of the employee's active life insurance benefit, subject to a maximum of $250,000, if under age 70; or 25 percent of the employee's active life insurance benefit, subject to a maximum of $125,000, if age 70 or older. The costs for this coverage are included in the "All other compensation" column of the "Summary compensation table".
Deferred income plans
Since 1986, the Company has offered its directors, officers and certain key employees the opportunity to defer income under deferred income plans. More details on the plans are provided in the "Non-qualified deferred compensation" section later in this proxy statement.
Perquisites
As a matter of business philosophy, the Company provides limited perquisites or personal benefits to executive officers (including the CEO). These limited perquisites include spousal travel to industry associations that encourage spousal attendance, executive financial and tax planning, and executive wellness benefits. When an executive must relocate, perquisites may also include the payment of relocation expenses as well as the associated tax obligations.
Tax implications of the Committee's compensation decisions
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") generally limits tax deductibility of compensation paid by a public company to its chief executive officer and certain other executive officers in any year to $1 million in the year compensation becomes taxable to the executive. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, certain compensation was exempt from the deduction limit to the extent it met the requirements to be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" as previously defined in Section 162(m). Certain arrangements entered into prior to November 2, 2017 are considered ''grandfathered'' and compensation paid under such arrangements will continue to be deductible until the arrangements are materially modified.
The Committee has historically considered Section 162(m) in the design of incentive plans to preserve the corporate tax deductibility of compensation. However, in light of the changes to Section 162(m), the Committee anticipates that a larger portion of future compensation paid to our NEOs will be subject to a tax deduction disallowance under Section 162(m). The Committee recognizes that factors other than tax deductibility should be considered in determining the forms and levels of executive compensation most appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Annually, the Committee reviews all compensation programs and payments, including the tax impact on the Company.
Accounting information
The Company accounts for equity incentive grants under FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of stock-based awards is estimated using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date or, for those with the total shareholder return modifier, using a Monte Carlo simulation model that assesses probabilities of various outcomes of market conditions. Each year, an independent third party runs the Monte Carlo simulation, which is subject to the audit procedures of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. During fiscal year 2018, the Company did not make any modifications to equity grants that resulted in a re-measurement of expense under the accounting rules.
Compensation committee report
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with Company management the CD&A section included in this proxy statement. Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that this CD&A be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in the 2018 10-K.

Executive compensation tables
Summary compensation table
The table that follows presents information about compensation for the Company's NEOs for the last three completed fiscal years.
Salary
Salary includes amounts earned in each fiscal year. In fiscal year 2018, the Committee approved adjustments to salaries of officers at its November 2017 meeting after the appointment of officers. The amounts in this column also include any amounts of salary that the NEO may have deferred under the Spire Employee Savings Plan and the deferred income plan. Salary deferred under the deferred income plan also appears in the "Executive contributions in last FY" column of the "Non-qualified deferred compensation table" later in this proxy statement.
Bonus
The amounts in this column represent sign-on or discretionary bonuses. No such bonuses were made in fiscal year 2018. Amounts under the Company's AIP are reported in the "Non-equity incentive plan compensation" column.
Stock awards
The amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value calculated using the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718 exclusive of the estimate of forfeitures. For those shares subject to performance-based conditions, the value reflects the probable outcome as of the grant date.
Non-equity incentive plan compensation
This column includes incentive payments earned by the NEOs under the AIP. Further details relative to the AIP can be found in the CD&A.
Change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings
This column includes the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the NEOs' accumulated benefits under the Spire Missouri Employees' Retirement Plan and the supplemental retirement plans, as well as the above-market or preferential earnings in fiscal year 2018 on deferrals in the deferred income plan.
Summary compensation table
The amounts for stock awards are presented excluding any actual or estimated forfeitures.
Grants of plan-based awards
The plans under which grants in the table below were made are generally described in the CD&A in the "Annual incentive compensation" and "Long-term incentive compensation" sections.
Under the AIP, performance metrics and potential targets for awards are typically approved in November, with the determinations of earned award amounts made the following November, based upon corporate, business unit, if applicable, and individual performance in the most recently completed fiscal year.
Equity awards are generally considered for grant in November each year, with the grant date occurring approximately one week after the November Committee meeting. Under the EIP, the Committee may grant performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, stock options, restricted stock shares or restricted stock units.
In November 2017, EIP awards were made to Ms. Sitherwood and Messrs. Rasche, Lindsey, Darrell and Geiselhart. These awards included PCSUs that vest upon the attainment of multi-year performance objectives. Under the terms of the awards, these units may vest if certain corporate performance metrics for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance period are met or exceeded. The performance metrics for the units granted in fiscal year 2018 are the cumulative three-year average NEEPS over fiscal years 2018-2020 and relative TSR, which are weighted at 50 percent each. If the performance criteria are not satisfied for the fiscal years 2018-2020 performance period, the awards will be forfeited. At the conclusion of the performance period, payouts can range from 0 percent to 200 percent of target for each metric. After vesting, executives are expected to retain 75 percent of vested shares until their stock ownership requirements are met. In the event of a change in control, vesting may accelerate at the target level on a pro rata basis if the awards have not already been forfeited and the successor does not assume the award or provide a comparable award, provided that the assumed or replacement award must provide that the vesting will be accelerated if the participant is terminated without cause within 24 months of the change in control. If a participant leaves the Company due to death, disability or retirement, the participant's award may vest on a pro rata basis if the performance metrics are met. Dividend equivalents on PCSUs are accrued throughout the performance period and paid to the participant in proportion to the amount of shares actually earned at vesting. No interest is paid on the accrued dividends. More details on these awards are included in the "Long-term incentive compensation" section of the CD&A.
Outstanding equity awards at fiscal year end table
Option exercises and stock vested in fiscal 2018 table
None of the NEOs had any stock options to exercise in fiscal year 2018, so those columns do not appear in the table below. The value column reflects the shares acquired on vesting multiplied by the closing price on the vesting date.
Pension plan compensation
The NEOs participate in the Spire Missouri Employees' Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit plan sponsored by Spire Missouri Inc.
Grandfathered pension benefit
Effective January 1, 2009, Spire Missouri Inc. amended its plan to change the way benefits are calculated. Prior to that date, the Plan provided benefits based on a final pay formula that used a participant's years of credited service and average final compensation. The average final compensation is the highest consecutive three-year average of the final 10 years of employment. Participants' years of credited service under the plan were frozen as of December 31, 2008; however, the average final pay was not frozen and will continue to be based on the highest three-year average in the final 10 years of employment. Benefits under the plan formula in effect prior to January 1, 2009 are referred to as "grandfathered benefits." With respect to annual incentive compensation paid on or after January 1, 2013, average final compensation will exclude such incentive compensation for purposes of the grandfathered benefit. Of the NEOs, only Mr. Darrell and Mr. Geiselhart have grandfathered benefits.
While normal retirement age under the plan is age 65, participants may retire at age 60 with 10 or more years of service without reduction of the grandfathered benefit for early retirement. Retirement at age 60 is assumed in calculating the grandfathered benefits for Mr. Darrell and Mr. Geiselhart.
Cash balance benefit
On and after January 1, 2009, the plan uses a cash balance formula that provides: (i) a cash balance credit between 4 and 10 percent of compensation (base salary and annual incentive compensation) depending on the participant's age, and (ii) interest credits using a rate equal to an average of corporate bond rates published by the Internal Revenue Service. Benefits under the plan formula in effect on and after January 1, 2009 are referred to as "current benefits." The cash balance credit and interest credit are applied as of December 31 of each year, on an average monthly basis, with interest compounded monthly. During fiscal year 2018, cash balance credits were as follows:
The early retirement amount of the current benefits will be the amount credited in the participant's cash balance account in the case of a lump sum payment. If an annuity is taken at early retirement, the benefit will be the actuarial equivalent of the lump sum amount.
Supplemental retirement benefits
The Code generally places a limit on the amount of the annual pension that can be paid from a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as well as on the amount of annual earnings that can be used to calculate a pension benefit. Since 1977, Spire Missouri Inc. has maintained a Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan that covers benefits that accrued through December 31, 2004 and that pays eligible employees the difference between the amount payable under the tax-qualified plan and the amount they would have received without the limits on the qualified plan or without any deferred income plan contributions. Spire Missouri Inc. adopted the Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan II to comply with Code Section 409A, which covers grandfathered benefits accrued on and after January 1, 2005. It also adopted the Cash Balance Supplemental Retirement Benefit Plan to provide similar supplemental benefits for those that accrue on and after January 1, 2009 under the current benefit formula.
Please note the following relating to the benefits shown in the table below:
The pension benefits in the table below were calculated using:
Pension benefits table
Non-qualified deferred compensation
Executives are eligible to participate in the deferred compensation plans offered by the Company.
Spire Deferred Income Plan
The Spire Inc. Deferred Income Plan covers participant deferrals made on and after January 1, 2005 and is intended to comply with Code Section 409A.
Executive deferrals
Effective January 1, 2015, the Deferred Income Plan allows participants, including the NEOs, to defer up to 50 percent of annual salary, and up to 90 percent of Annual Incentive Plan compensation.
Prior to 2015, participants could defer up to 15 percent of annual salary.
Plan investments
Effective January 1, 2016, the Spire Deferred Income Plan provides participant investment options that mirror returns in certain 401(k) plan investment funds and Company stock. Participants may also elect an annual fixed interest rate based on Moody's Corporate Bond Rate not to exceed 120 percent of the Applicable Federal Rate.
Deferrals made prior to 2016 earn investment income equal to the greater of: 
Plan benefits
The Spire Deferred Income Plan provides retirement benefits payable in annual installments over a 15-year period based on the deferred account balance as of the date of retirement.
In the event of any other termination of employment prior to age 55, the executive will receive the deferred account balance reduced by any additional interest credits payable in a lump sum.
The Spire Deferred Income Plan provides:
For participant deferrals made after calendar 2015, the disability and change in control termination benefits are equal to the deferred account balance at the date of disability or termination.
For participant deferrals made after calendar year 2015, the death benefits are equal to the deferred account balance plus participant deferrals projected from the date of death to the end of the plan year in which death occurred.
For participant deferrals made prior to calendar year 2016, the disability deferred account balance is credited with investment income through the end of the plan year in which disability occurs.
The benefits payable for participant deferrals prior to calendar year 2016 upon death, disability and change in control termination are equal to the greater of:
Laclede Gas Company Deferred Income Plan II
The Laclede Gas Company Deferred Income Plan II ("Deferred Income Plan II") covers participant deferrals prior to January 1, 2005.
The Deferred Income Plan II provides similar benefits as the Spire Deferred Income Plan with the following exceptions:
The amounts in the table below include contributions by the executive and investment earnings under both deferred compensation plans.
Non-qualified deferred compensation table
Potential payments upon termination or change in control
This section describes the potential payments and benefits to which the NEOs would have been entitled upon termination of employment, including termination of employment following a change in control, as if such termination had occurred on the last trading day of our fiscal year (September 30, 2018) using the New York Stock Exchange closing price of $73.55 per share of the Company's stock on that date. The discussion does not include payments and benefits to the extent they are generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried employees upon termination of employment. The following table sets forth the potential payments to the NEOs upon the termination of their employment with the Company, including a termination of employment following a change in control. The table does not include retirement plan benefits payable to the executives shown in the "Pension benefits table".
CEO pay ratio
Under Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to provide the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. Sitherwood, president and chief executive officer, to the annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company.
For fiscal year 2018, the median annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than the president and chief executive officer) was $89,539. Ms. Sitherwood's total annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 was $4,016,839. Based on this information, the ratio of the compensation of the chief executive officer to the median annual total compensation of all other employees was estimated to be 45 to 1.
To identify the median employee, and to determine the total annual compensation of such employee, we used the following methodology. We identified our median employee as of the end of the fiscal year, September 30, 2018, using our entire workforce of 3,366 employees, and base pay, plus annual and long-term incentive compensation, for the period of October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. With respect to the annual total compensation of Ms. Sitherwood, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the "Summary compensation table".
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by the Company may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.
Proposal 3: Ratification of appointment of independent registered public accountant
The Board of Directors, upon recommendation of its audit committee, recommends that you ratify the appointment of Deloitte independent registered public accountant, to audit the books, records and accounts of Spire Inc. and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. A representative of Deloitte will be present at the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Audit committee report
The audit committee of the Board of Directors is composed of five directors who are independent as required by and in compliance with the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and the rules of the SEC. The names of the committee members as of the date of this proxy statement appear at the end of this report. The committee operates under a written charter.
The primary function of the audit committee is oversight. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements. Management is also responsible for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting practices and policies; for establishing internal controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Company is in compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations; and for assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Deloitte, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for planning and performing an independent audit of the financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and to issue reports expressing an opinion, based on its audit (i) as to the conformity of the audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and (ii) on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of Deloitte.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the 2018 10-K with management and Deloitte, which included a discussion of the critical accounting policies and practices used by the Company. The committee also discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed under the applicable PCAOB standards.
Deloitte has provided the committee with the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the committee has discussed with Deloitte its independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the 2018 10-K.

Fees of independent registered public accountant
The following table displays the aggregate fees for professional audit services for the audit of the financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, and fees incurred for other services during those periods by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte.
The total fees for fiscal year 2018 were slightly higher than 2017. The increase in the audit-related fees is the result of increased fees related to the adoption of the new revenue standard and PCAOB standard. This increase was partially offset by lower fees for comfort letters and consents. The audit committee pre-approved all of the fees for fiscal years 2018 and 2017. The Policy Regarding the Approval of Independent Registered Public Accountant Provision of Audit and Non-Audit Services is described earlier in this proxy statement.

Questions and answers about the annual meeting
Who is soliciting my vote?
The Board of Directors of the Company is soliciting your vote for the Company's annual meeting of shareholders.
When will the meeting take place?
The annual meeting will be held on Thursday, January 31, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time at the Company's principal offices at 700 Market Street, St. Louis, MO 63101.
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting?
If you owned Company stock at the close of business on November 30, 2018, you may attend and vote at the annual meeting.
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a paper copy of proxy materials?
Under the "Notice and Access" rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are permitted to furnish proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, to our shareholders, by providing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Most shareholders will not receive printed copies unless they request them. The Notice instructs you as to how you may access proxy materials on the internet and how you may submit your proxy via the internet. If you would like to receive a paper or electronic copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. Any request to receive proxy materials by mail or electronically will remain in effect until you revoke it.
If more than one shareholder lives in my household and I have elected to receive printed copies of the proxy materials, how can I obtain an extra copy of the proxy materials?
For those shareholders that have elected to receive printed copies of our proxy materials, under the rules of the SEC, we are permitted to deliver a single copy of the Notice or this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K to multiple shareholders that share the same address, unless we have received contrary instructions from any such shareholder. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. Upon written or oral request, we will mail a separate copy of this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K to any shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of each document was delivered. You may call, toll free, 866-540-7095, or write to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 to request a separate copy.
Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the notice?
No, the Notice identifies the items to be voted on at the annual meeting; you cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to: (i) vote by internet, (ii) vote by telephone and (iii) request and return a paper proxy card or voting instruction card.
Why didn't I receive a notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials?
If you previously elected to access proxy materials over the internet, you will not receive a Notice in the mail. You should have received an email with links to the proxy materials and online proxy voting. Also, if you previously requested paper copies of the proxy materials or if applicable regulations required delivery of the proxy materials, you will not receive the Notice.
If you received a paper copy of the proxy materials or the Notice by mail, you can eliminate paper mailings in the future by electing to receive an email that will provide internet links to these documents. Opting to receive future proxy materials online will save us the cost of producing and mailing documents and help us conserve natural resources. Enrollment for electronic delivery is effective until canceled.
Who is a shareholder of record?
You are a shareholder of record if your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare. You will receive a Notice or these proxy materials by delivery directly to you. You are entitled to vote your shares by internet, telephone, in person at the meeting, or, if you have requested printed proxy materials, by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card.
Who is a beneficial owner?
You are a beneficial owner if you hold your stock in a stock brokerage account, or through a bank or other nominee. Your shares are held in "street name" and the Notice or these proxy materials are being sent to you by your broker, bank or nominee, who is considered the shareholder of record. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote. You may attend the annual meeting, but you will need to bring a letter or statement from that firm that shows you were a beneficial owner of Company shares on November 30, 2018. You may not vote these shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request, complete and deliver a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee. If you requested printed proxy materials, your broker, bank or nominee provided a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee on how to vote your shares.
How many shares must be present to hold the annual meeting?
A majority of our issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting as of the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy to have a quorum. As of November 30, 2018, there were 50,706,614 shares outstanding. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining quorum.
How many votes are required for each item of business?
Election of directors
The election of directors requires the affirmative vote FOR each nominee of a majority of those shares entitled to vote and present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy. Withheld votes and abstentions will have the effect of votes against the nominee, while broker non-votes will not be considered represented and will have no effect on the outcome.
Advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers
This proposal, which is non-binding, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting to be approved. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the proposal, while broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome.
Ratification of appointment of independent registered public accountant
This proposal requires an affirmative vote FOR of a majority of those shares entitled to vote and present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy to be approved. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the proposal.
Voting matters
How do I vote?
You may vote on the internet, by telephone, by mail, or by attending the annual meeting and voting by ballot. The internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate that you are a shareholder by use of a control number. The procedures allow you to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone or internet, you do not need to mail back your proxy card or voting instruction card.
By internet
If you have internet access, you may submit your proxy by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested printed proxy materials, by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card or voting instruction card. On the internet voting site, you can confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote on the internet, you can also request electronic delivery of future proxy materials.
By telephone
You can vote by telephone by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested printed proxy materials, by following the instructions provided with your proxy materials and on your proxy card or voting instruction card.
By mail
If you elected to receive printed proxy materials by mail, you may choose to vote by mail by marking your proxy card or voting instruction card, dating and signing it, and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Please allow sufficient time for mailing if you decide to vote by mail.
At the annual meeting
The method or timing of your vote will not limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you attend the annual meeting and vote in person. However, if your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or the nominee, you must obtain a legal proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record to be able to vote at the annual meeting. You should allow yourself enough time prior to the annual meeting to obtain this proxy from the holder of record.
The shares voted electronically, by telephone or represented by proxy cards received, properly marked, dated, signed and not revoked, will be voted at the annual meeting.
If you hold your shares through a broker, please note that your broker will not be permitted to vote on your behalf for the first two proposals unless you provide instructions as to how to vote your shares. Voting your shares is important to ensure that you are represented at the meeting. If you have any questions about the voting process, please contact the broker where you hold your shares.
Can I vote my shares that are held in the Company's dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or any of the Company's 401(k) plans?
If you participate in the Company's dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan or in the Company Stock Fund of the Spire Employee Savings Plan, you are entitled to vote those shares. If you do not give voting instructions for shares owned by you through this plan, none of your shares held in the plan will be voted. To allow sufficient time for voting by the administrator and trustee of the plan, your voting instructions must be received by January 29, 2019.
How can I revoke or change my vote?
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the meeting by:
How many votes do I have?
You are entitled to one vote for each share that you owned on November 30, 2018.
What happens if I don't give specific voting instructions?
Shareholders of record
If you are a shareholder of record and you either indicate that you want to vote as recommended by the Board of Directors or you return a signed proxy card but do not indicate how you want to vote, then your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion regarding any other matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. If you indicate a choice for any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions.
Beneficial owners
If you hold shares in street name and do not provide instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes" on certain proposals. Generally, broker non-votes occur on a non-routine proposal where a broker is not permitted to vote on that proposal without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. Broker non-votes are considered present at the annual meeting, but not as voting on a matter. Thus, broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, but are not counted for purposes of determining whether a matter has been approved. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the votes on the first two proposals. If you do not provide instructions to your broker, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, your broker will not be authorized to vote the shares it holds for you with respect to the first two proposals. Your broker has the discretion, however, to vote the shares it holds for you on the ratification of the independent registered public accountant.
Who counts the votes?
We hired Broadridge Investor Communications as an independent tabulator of votes to ensure confidentiality of the voting process. However, if you write comments on your proxy card, the comments will be shared with us. We also have hired IVS Associates, Inc. to serve as independent inspector of elections.
