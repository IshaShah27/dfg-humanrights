PROPOSAL 3 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the Exchange Act"), we are asking you to provide an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation awarded to our named executive officers, as we have described it in the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement. 
As described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") oversees the program and compensation awarded; adopts changes to the program; and awards compensation as appropriate to reflect the Company's circumstances and to promote the main objectives of the program. These objectives include: attracting and retaining top-level, talented leaders in a highly competitive environment; rewarding increased shareholder returns and profitable growth; and aligning pay to performance. 
We are asking you to indicate your support for our named executive officer compensation. We believe that the information we have provided in this Proxy Statement demonstrates that our compensation program is designed appropriately and works to ensure that the interests of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, are aligned with your interest in long-term value creation. 
Accordingly, we ask you to approve the following resolution at the annual meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of the Company approve the compensation awarded to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed, pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the accompanying compensation tables and related narrative in this Proxy Statement for the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
This advisory resolution is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although non-binding, the Board and the Committee will review the voting results and consider your concerns in their continued evaluation of the Company's compensation program. Because this vote is advisory in nature, it will not affect any compensation already paid or awarded to any named executive officer; it will not be binding on or overrule any decisions by the Board of Directors; and it will not restrict or limit the ability of the shareholders to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy of providing for annual advisory votes to approve executive compensation. Unless the Board of Directors modifies its policy, the next such advisory vote will occur at the Company's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 
PROPOSAL 4 
AMENDMENT OF STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
In September 1998, your Board of Directors adopted the Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Plan" ), covering the issuance of up to 13,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The adoption of the Plan was approved by shareholders in November 1998. In November 2002, November 2005, November 2008, and November 2013, shareholders approved amendments to the Plan to, among other things, increase the number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan. Where applicable, the number of shares noted in this proposal has been adjusted to reflect the stock splits in November 2001 and November 2006. 
The purpose of the Plan is to strengthen our ability to attract and retain key team members and to provide an incentive to team members who will be responsible for the Company's future growth and continued success. The Plan allows the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock awards to eligible participants. At the annual meeting, you are being asked to approve an amendment to the Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available for options and Stock Awards under the Plan by an additional 1,350,000 shares. 
When approving the amendment to the Plan, the Board of Directors considered, among other things, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the continued importance of motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees;  
• potential dilution to its current stockholders as measured by burn rate and overhang (as described in Key Data  below); and  
• the guidelines published by stockholder advisory firms like Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services  ("ISS").  
[END TABLE]
Reasons for the Proposal 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the Company's shareholders approve the amendment to the Plan. The primary goal of the amendment is to provide us with a sufficient reserve of Common Stock to offer appropriate incentives to eligible participants. Our ability to grant an appropriate number of equity-based awards continues to be crucial in allowing us to effectively compete for key employee talent. It is in the long-term interest of the Company and our shareholders to strengthen the ability to attract, motivate and retain eligible participants, and to provide additional incentive for those persons through stock ownership and other incentives to improve operations, increase profits and strengthen the mutuality of interest between those persons and our shareholders. Our equity program is a key component of our strategy to attract and retain key individuals, and the share requirements of our equity program have grown with us. Each year, the Committee and our management review our overall compensation strategy and determine the allocations of cash and equity compensation in light of our pay-for-performance philosophy. We continue to believe that equity compensation is critical in motivating key employees and that it effectively aligns employee compensation with shareholder interests. The Plan is the sole plan available for granting equity compensation to our employees. 
If the amendment to the Plan is not approved, the number of shares currently available under the Plan may not be sufficient to cover projected awards for an additional year. Thus, if the amendment to the Plan is not approved, we may not be able to provide persons eligible for awards with compensation packages that are necessary to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. If we are unable to grant equity compensation in the future, we may need to consider other compensation alternatives, such as increasing cash compensation. 
Key Data 
The Committee is committed to effectively managing the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan while minimizing shareholder dilution. The 1,350,000 share increase requested to be approved by shareholders would increase potential dilution as of September 25, 2018 from 11.92% to 14.93%. The Committee has considered this potential dilution level in the context of competitive data from its peer group, and believes that the resulting dilution levels would be within normal competitive ranges. 
When recommending the amendment to the Plan, the Committee considered the burn rate with respect to the equity awards granted by the Company. The burn rate is equal to the total number of equity awards we granted in a fiscal year divided by the weighted average common stock outstanding during the year. We endeavor to achieve a burn rate that approximates the average rate for our peer group companies and to achieve burn rates within the limits published by independent shareholder advisory groups, such as ISS. Our three-year average burn rate as of the last day of fiscal year 2018 was approximately 3.26%. The Committee believes that this burn rate has been within the range granted by its peer companies, is reasonable from a competitive standpoint and falls within the guidelines published by ISS. 
When considering the number of additional shares to add to the Plan, the Committee also reviewed, among other things, projected future share usage and projected future forfeitures. The projected future usage of shares for long-term incentive awards under the amended Plan was reviewed under scenarios based on a variety of assumptions. Depending on assumptions, the 1,350,000 shares to be added to the amended Plan, in combination with the remaining authorized shares and shares added back to the Plan from forfeitures of awards previously granted, is expected to satisfy, assuming no significant acquisitions of other companies, our equity compensation needs for 3 years of similar levels of awards. 
The following table sets forth certain information about all of our Plans:

(1)  On August 31, 2017, the Company granted 203,347 stock options to Mr. Roberts as part of his annual compensation, and  500,000 Performance-Based Options as an Executive Special Equity Award. Pursuant to the Plan, the maximum number of options that may be granted to an individual in a fiscal year is 500,000. Collectively, these grants exceeded this limit. The

     Company has therefore determined, and Mr. Roberts has acknowledged, that 203,347 of the Performance-Based Options ("Excess Options") are null and void. The Committee, assisted by its  independent compensation consultant, has reaffirmed in its business judgment that the Excess Options were an integral part of Mr. Roberts' compensation and were aligned with the interests of the Company's shareholders. Therefore, in order  to satisfy the original intent with respect to Mr. Roberts' compensation, the Committee intends to grant Mr. Roberts appropriate equity incentive compensation awards at similar or comparable levels to the value of the Excess Options, taking  into account the interests of the Company's shareholders and all relevant factors.

Improved Shareholder Protection and Good Corporate Governance Practices 
The Plan, as amended, provides for the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock options and stock appreciation rights may not have a term in excess of ten years, may not be repriced without  shareholder approval and may not be granted at a discount to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date;  
• no evergreen or liberal share recycling feature;  
• double-trigger change in control vesting;  
• authority to claw back awards in accordance with any clawback policy maintained by us; and  
• does not permit any tax gross up for excise taxes assessed against any excess parachute payments in connection with a  change in control.  
[END TABLE]
The complete text of the Plan, as amended, is set forth on Appendix A hereto. We have provided below a summary description of the material terms of the amended Plan, but please note the summary is subject in all respects to the terms of the amended Plan. 
Summary of the Plan 
Stock Options 
The Plan is designed to permit the granting of options to all of our team members (of which there were 58,478 team members as of June 27, 2018), although we have historically granted options only to certain of our salaried team members. The administration of the Plan is provided by the Committee which has the authority to determine the terms on which options are granted under the Plan. The Committee determines the number of options to be granted to eligible participants, determines the exercise price, vesting period, the objective performance goals, if any, that must be met, and option period at the time the option is granted, and administers and interprets the Plan. The Plan provides that no option and no SAR (hereinafter defined) shall be granted with a time period for exercise greater than 10 years from the date of grant. Our recent option grants have been for time periods less than 10 years. 
The exercise price of options is payable in cash or the holder of an option may request approval from the Committee to exercise an option or a portion thereof by tendering shares of Common Stock at the fair market value per share on the date of exercise in lieu of cash payment of the exercise price. 
Both incentive stock options ("ISOs") and non-qualified stock options may be granted under the Plan. The Plan requires that the exercise price of an option will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant of the option. No ISO may be granted under the Plan to anyone who owns more than 10% of the outstanding Common Stock unless the exercise price is at least 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the option is not exercisable more than five years after it is granted. There is no limit on the fair market value of ISOs that may be granted to a team member in any calendar year, but no team member may be granted ISOs that first become exercisable during a calendar year for the purchase of stock with an aggregate fair market value (determined as of the date of grant of each option) in excess of $100,000 and no team member may be granted more than 500,000 options and SARs in a fiscal year. An option (or an installment thereof) counts against the annual limitation only in the year it first becomes exercisable. 
Tax Status of Stock Options 
Pursuant to the Plan, the Committee determines whether an option will be either an "ISO" or a "nonqualified option." In general, no taxable income will be recognized by the optionee, and no deduction will be allowed to us, upon the grant of an option. 
Incentive Stock Options. All stock options that qualify under the rules of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code will be entitled to ISO treatment. To receive ISO treatment, an optionee is not permitted to dispose of the acquired stock (i) within two years after the option is granted, or (ii) within one year after exercise. In addition, the individual must have been a team member of the Company for the entire time from the date of granting of the option until three months (one year if the team member is disabled) before the date of the exercise. The requirement that the individual be a team member and the two-year and one-year holding periods are waived in the case of death of the team member. If all such requirements are met, no tax will be imposed upon exercise of the option, and any gain upon sale of the stock will be entitled to capital gain treatment. The team member's gain on exercise (the excess of fair market value at the time of exercise over the exercise price) of an ISO is a tax preference item and, accordingly, is included in the computation of alternative minimum taxable income. 
If a team member does not meet the two-year and one-year holding requirements, but does meet all other requirements, tax will be imposed at the time of sale of the stock, but the team member's gain on exercise will be treated as ordinary income rather than a capital gain and we will receive a corresponding deduction at the time of sale. Any remaining gain on sale will be short-term or a long-term capital gain, depending on the holding period of the stock. 
An optionee's stock option agreement may permit payment for stock upon the exercise of an ISO to be made with other shares of Common Stock. In such a case, in general, if a team member uses stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO to acquire other stock in connection with the exercise of an ISO, it may result in ordinary income if the stock so used has not met the minimum statutory holding period necessary for favorable tax treatment as an ISO. 
Non-Qualified Stock Options. Upon exercise of a non-qualified option, an optionee will recognize ordinary income (and we will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction if applicable withholding requirements are satisfied) in an amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date exceeds the exercise price. Any additional gain or loss after exercise realized by an optionee on subsequent disposition of such shares generally is a capital gain or loss and does not result in a tax deduction to us. 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits a publicly traded company's federal income tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the next three highest-paid executive officers. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, compensation that satisfied conditions set forth under Section 162(m) to qualify as "performance-based compensation" was not subject to the limitation, and the limitation did not apply to compensation paid to the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the performance-based compensation exception but provided a transition rule with respect to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified after that date. With the elimination of the exemption for performance-based compensation, we expect that we will be unable to deduct all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and our other named executive officers covered by the new tax law, other than previously granted awards that comply with the transition rules. The Committee intends to administer any awards granted prior to November 2, 2017, which qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including certain awards made under the Plan that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation, in accordance with the transition rules applicable to binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. With respect to such awards, in order for the award to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), restrictions imposed by the Committee were based on a specified list of performance goals and certain other requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules and regulations under Section 162(m) and the transition rule are complicated and subject to change and as such there can be no guarantee that any compensation intended to qualify as performance-based compensation will so qualify. 
Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Awards 
The Plan also permits, among other things, (i) the grant of stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and (ii) restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares (collectively, "Stock Awards") (SARs and Stock Awards are collectively referred to as "Awards"). All of our employees are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, although it is anticipated that only certain salaried team members will receive Awards. When an Award is made, the Committee will specify (a) the amount and form of the Award, (b) the objective performance goals, if any, that must be met in order for amounts to be payable pursuant to the Award, (c) the period, if any, during which the performance goals must be met, and (d) the period, if any, during which the participant must remain employed by the Company or a subsidiary as a condition of the Award ("Vesting Period"). The Committee may specify additional terms as it deems appropriate. 
The Committee may establish objective performance goals for Awards as more particularly described below. The objective performance goals may relate to the performance of a team member's department or restaurant brand or the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries as a whole, or any combination of the preceding groups. The Committee may use any objectively determinable performance goals to measure performance. At the end of each performance period for which an Award relates, the Committee will determine whether and to what extent the performance goals have been met. Awards will not be paid to the extent that the performance goals are not met. If any performance goal, business criteria or target for an Award is affected by special factors, subject to any limitations in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code as applicable to any Awards that comply with the transition rules described above, the Committee may make special adjustments in the performance goal, business criteria or target. 
Performance Goals. For Awards that were intended to satisfy the conditions for deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code as "performance based compensation," the performance goals were selected from among the following criteria, which may be applied to the Company as a whole, or to an individual recipient, or to a department, brand, unit, division or function within the Company or an affiliate, or any combination of the preceding groups, and they could apply on a pre- or post-tax basis, either alone or relative to the performance of other businesses or individuals (including industry or general market indices): (a) earnings (either in the aggregate or on a per share basis, reflecting dilution of shares as the Committee deems appropriate and, if the Committee so determined, net of or including dividends) before or after interest and taxes (sometimes called EBIT), before or after interest, taxes and rent (sometimes called EBITR), or before or after interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (sometimes called EBITDA); (b) gross or net revenue or changes in annual revenues; (c) cash flow(s) (including either operating or net cash flows); (d) financial return ratios; (e) total shareholder return, shareholder return based on growth measures or the attainment by the shares of a specified value for a specified period of time, share price, or share price appreciation; (f) earnings growth or growth in earnings per share; (g) total business return, or return measures, including return or net return on assets, net assets, equity, capital, investment, or gross sales; (h) adjusted pre-tax margin; (i) pre-tax profits; (j) operating margins; (k) operating profits; (l) operating or capital expenses; (m) dividends; (n) net income or net operating income; (o) growth in operating earnings; (p) value of assets; (q) market share or market penetration with respect to specific designated products or product groups and/or specific geographic areas; (r) aggregate product price and other product measures; (s) expense or cost levels, in each case, where applicable, determined either on a company-wide basis or in respect of any one or more specified divisions; (t) reduction of losses, loss ratios or expense ratios; (u) reduction in fixed costs; (v) operating cost management; (w) cost of capital; (x) debt reduction; (y) productivity improvements; (z) inventory turnover; (aa) satisfaction of specified business expansion goals or goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures; (bb) customer satisfaction based on specified objective goals or a customer survey; (cc) diversity goals; (dd) turnover; (ee) specified objective social goals; (ff) safety record; (gg) retention of high-potential team members; (hh) flow through of cash, sales, earnings, profits or other financial measures; (ii) growth in franchised locations; (jj) culinary product pipeline goals; (kk) brand positioning goals; or (ll) development pipeline goals. 
Subject to any limitations in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, for awards that comply with the transition rules described above, the Committee may include or exclude items to measure specific objectives, such as losses from discontinued operations, extraordinary gains or losses, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, tax law changes, acquisitions or divestitures, foreign exchange impacts, any unusual non-recurring gain or loss, and other items as the Committee determines to be required so that the operating results of the Company, or any business unit, division or affiliate of the Company shall be computed on a comparative basis from performance period to performance period. 
Awards may also be subject to vesting requirements under which the participant must remain a full-time active team member of the Company or a subsidiary throughout a "Vesting Period" in order for the Award to be payable. No team member may be granted more than 500,000 Stock Awards in a fiscal year. The Committee has previously established the Performance Share Plan, the Restricted Stock Unit Plan, the Performance-Based Options Plan, and the Career Equity Plan under the Committee's authority to grant Awards under the Plan and such plans are subject to, among other items, the overall and annual limitations on grants of Stock Awards. Any awards under those plans will not result in additional dilution to the shareholders because those plans utilize shares reserved for issuance under the Plan. 
Tax Status of SARs and Stock Awards 
Under the Internal Revenue Code, except as described below, if Awards are made in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, or performance shares, no income will be realized by the team member upon grant of such Award unless the Award fully vests upon the date of grant of the Award or the Award is restricted stock with no risk of substantial forfeiture. When restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance shares vest, the team member will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the then fair market value of the shares or units. With regard to Awards of restricted stock, a team member may elect to make a "Section 83(b) election" under the Internal Revenue Code, in which case the team member will recognize income on the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time the shares are granted. A Section 83(b) election must be made within 30 days after the restricted stock is granted. We generally will be entitled to a federal income tax deduction at the time the team member recognizes income on the restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance shares. 
If Awards are made in the form of SARs, no income will be realized by the team member upon the award of SARs. When the SARs vest, the team member will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the cash value of the SARs. We generally will be entitled to a federal income tax deduction at the time the team member recognizes income on the SARs. 
Further, the Plan and any Awards granted under it are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, or will be structured to not cause a team member to be subject to taxes and interest under Section 409(A). 
Acceleration of Exercisability and Vesting 
Full or partial acceleration of vesting may occur in the event of death, disability or involuntary termination. The Committee may accelerate vesting, in whole or in part, under such circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate, but subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the transition rule, if applicable. 
Beginning with awards granted in fiscal 2017, we removed single-trigger provisions that would result in the automatic full vesting of awards upon a change in control. The provisions were refined as detailed below with respect to awards granted in fiscal 2018 and beyond: 
Restricted Stock Units, Stock Options and Performance-Based Stock Options: 
Outstanding awards of restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based stock options do not become fully vested upon a change in control (as defined in the applicable award agreement) unless the awards are not assumed or replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring entity or cease to remain outstanding immediately following the change in control. If a participant is terminated without Cause within 24 months following a change in control or terminates for Good Reason within 24 months following a change in control, all outstanding restricted stock units, stock options and performance-based stock options become fully vested (and, in the case of stock options and performance-based options, exercisable) upon such termination. 
Performance Share Plan: 
Performance share awards under our fiscal 2018 Performance Share Plan do not vest upon a change in control (as defined in the plan) unless the awards are not assumed or replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring entity in such a change in control, or cease to remain outstanding immediately following the change in control. Otherwise, upon a change in control, the applicable measurement period (but not the performance period) will end and the performance calculations will be modified to account for the shortened measurement period. A participant must remain employed through the end of the performance period to earn such award, unless the participant is terminated without Cause or terminates for Good Reason following the change in control, in which case the participant will fully vest upon termination in the number of achieved shares determined based on performance through the change in control date. 
Cessation of Employment 
Each individual grant agreement sets forth the rights and restrictions of the team member as to continued vesting and exercise of options after the team member's cessation of employment with the Company. Under the terms of the current individual grant agreement, subject to exceptions set forth in the grant agreement, if a team member ceases to be employed by the Company, then, in general, the team member shall have the lesser of the original option period or 90 days to exercise any vested stock options, and all unvested options, restricted stock units, and performance shares immediately expire. The current grant agreement also provides for vesting and exercise in the event of retirement by a team member. Early retirement is defined as age plus years of service equal 70, with a minimum age of 55. Normal retirement is defined as age plus years of service equal 70, with a minimum age of 60, or age 65 (regardless of service). The following table outlines the current retirement rules: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Stock Options     Unvested options accelerated and the shorter of 12 months or the expiration date to exercise.       Unvested options accelerated and the shorter of 36 months or the expiration date to exercise. 
 Performance-Based Options     Unvested options are forfeited       Unvested options are forfeited 
 Performance Shares     Pro-rated and paid at the end of measurement period based on actual results.       The full award is paid at the end of the measurement period based on actual results. 
 Restricted Stock Units     Pro-rated and paid upon retirement       The full award is paid upon retirement 
[END TABLE]
Effectiveness and Term; Amendments and Termination 
The amended Plan will become effective upon approval by the Company's shareholders at the annual meeting. The amended Plan may be amended, altered or discontinued by the Committee without the approval of the shareholders, except that the Committee does not have the power or authority to adversely affect the rights of any participant or beneficiary of any stock options or Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date such amendment is adopted by the Committee in the absence of written consent to the change by the affected participant or beneficiary. The Committee, however, may make appropriate adjustments in the number of shares covered by the Plan, the number of outstanding options, option prices, and any restrictions on outstanding Awards to reflect any stock dividend, stock split, share combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin off, liquidation, change in control, or the like, of or by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment to the Plan may be made without approval of the Company's shareholders that would materially increase the number of shares available under the Plan (except as noted in the preceding sentence), change the types of Awards available under the Plan, materially expand the class of persons eligible to receive Awards under or otherwise participate in the Plan, materially extend the term of the Plan, materially change the method of determining the strike price of the options under the Plan, permit repricing of an option or SAR, or permit the grant of an option or SAR for, or in connection with, the cancellations or surrender of an option, SAR or Stock Award granted under the Plan having a higher option or exercise price. 
Current Information Regarding Plan 
Information about options and Awards granted during our 2018 fiscal year under the Plan to the named executive officers can be found in the tables under the headings Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table, and Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table following the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy Statement. During the 2018 fiscal year, options covering 866,324 shares were granted to current named executive officers as a group under the Plan and options covering 231,803 shares were granted under the Plan to all other eligible team members (excluding current named executive officers) as a group. Also during the 2018 fiscal year, 138,507 shares of restricted stock units were granted to current named executive officers as a group under the Plan and 285,030 shares of restricted stock units were granted under the Plan to all team members (excluding current named executive officers) as a group. The benefits that will be awarded or paid in the future under the amended Plan are not currently determinable. Such Awards are within the discretion of the Committee, and the Committee has not determined future Awards or who might receive them. 
Plan Amendment 
As of August 31, 2018, stock options and Stock Awards covering 3,318,568 shares were outstanding and 1,800,784 shares were available for grant under the Plan. If you approve the amendment to the Plan, the estimated maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan for options and Stock Awards would be increased to 3,150,784 shares. This number represents shares available for, but not yet subject to, a grant or award as of the date of this Proxy Statement1, assuming (i) no grants or awards were made under the Plan between August 31, 2018 and such date, and (ii) no grants or awards previously made under the Plan are canceled between August 31, 2018 and such date, plus the additional 1,350,000 shares authorized by the amendment to the Plan. 
Any shares that are represented by awards granted under any prior plan of the Company in which employees are eligible to participate which are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of shares or which result in the forfeiture of shares back to the Company will also be available for grant under the amended Plan. Further, any shares granted under the amended Plan that are forfeited because of the failure to meet an award contingency or condition will again be available for delivery pursuant to new awards granted under the amended Plan. To the extent any shares covered by an award are not delivered to a participant or beneficiary because the award is forfeited or canceled, or the shares are not delivered because the award is settled in cash, such shares will not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares available for delivery under the amended Plan. Shares delivered under the amended Plan in settlement, assumption or substitution of outstanding awards (or obligations to grant future awards) under the plans or arrangements of another entity will not reduce the maximum number of shares available for delivery under the amended Plan, to the extent that such settlement, assumption or substitution is a result of the Company or an affiliate acquiring another entity (or an interest in another entity). 
Either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares of Common Stock may be issued in connection with grants and awards under the Plan. In addition, any shares subject to an award which are forfeited or not issued because the terms and conditions of the grant or award are not met may be re-used for a new grant or award. 
Required Vote; Recommendation 
The favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present and entitled to vote at the annual meeting in person or by proxy is required to approve the amendment of the Plan. Abstentions are counted as votes cast and have the same effect as votes against the proposal. 
The Board of Directors believes that approval of the amendment of the Plan is in the best interest of the Company and that the additional shares will strengthen our ability to attract and retain key team members and furnish additional incentives to such persons by encouraging them to become owners of the Common Stock of the Company. 
YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE AMENDMENT TO THE STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   On August 31, 2017, the Company granted 203,347 stock options to Mr. Roberts as part of his annual compensation, and  500,000 Performance-Based Options as an Executive Special Equity Award. Pursuant to the Plan, the maximum number of options that may be granted to an individual in a fiscal year is 500,000. Collectively, these grants exceeded this limit. The Company  has therefore determined, and Mr. Roberts has acknowledged, that 203,347 of the Performance-Based Options ("Excess Options") are null and void. The Committee, assisted by its independent compensation consultant, has reaffirmed in its  business judgment that the Excess Options were an integral part of Mr. Roberts' compensation and were aligned with the interests of the Company's shareholders. Therefore, in order to satisfy the original intent with respect to Mr.  Roberts' compensation, the Committee intends to grant Mr. Roberts appropriate equity incentive compensation awards at similar or comparable levels to the value of the Excess Options prior to the shareholder meeting, taking into account the  interests of the Company's shareholders and all relevant factors.

INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND 
GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY 
Director Independence 
The Board reviews the independence of each non-employee director annually to confirm that the director continues to meet our standards, as well as the applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and rules of the SEC. No member of the Board will be considered independent unless the Board determines that he or she has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). The Board will not determine any director to be independent if he or she has or has had any of the relationships set forth in the NYSE rules during the time periods specified in such rules. The Board will describe in this Proxy Statement the basis for determining whether any relationship is immaterial. 
The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined each of the following directors is an "independent" director as such term is defined, and as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the requirements of the SEC and NYSE. 
Additionally, Gerardo I. Lopez was independent for the entire period he served on the Board until his retirement on July 23, 2018. The only member of the Board who is not independent is Wyman T. Roberts. Mr. Roberts, as President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Company, is the only employee member of the Board. The Board has further determined that no material relationship exists between the Company and each non-employee director outside of their service as a member of the Board of Directors. In this Proxy Statement we may refer to these directors individually as an "Independent Director" and collectively as the "Independent Directors." 
Board Structure 
Each director serves for a one-year term and is subject to re-election by you each year. Prior to recommending a director for nomination for re-election, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers many things, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality of past director service and attendance at Board of Directors and Committee meetings;  
• whether the director continues to possess the qualities and capabilities considered necessary or desirable for director  service;  
• input from other members of the Board of Directors concerning the performance of that director through the Board's  periodic peer review process, if applicable;  
• the independence of the director; and  
• whether the director has met any age limits for continued service.  
[END TABLE]
Board Committees 
The charters for each of the committees, as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are available at no charge to you in the Corporate Governance section of our website (http://brinker.com/corp_gov) or by written request directed to us at 6820 LBJ Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each member of the Audit, Compensation, and Governance and Nominating Committees meets the independence requirements of the NYSE and the SEC applicable to those committees. 
Audit Committee 
The role of the Audit Committee is described in the Report of the Audit Committee later in this Proxy Statement. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Giles is an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined in the SEC's Regulation S-K. Further, the Board of Directors has determined the members of the Audit Committee are "financially literate" as such term is defined by the NYSE and the Audit Committee satisfies the "financial management expertise" standard required by the NYSE. 
Compensation Committee 
A discussion of the specific nature of the Compensation Committee's responsibilities and compensation philosophy as they relate to our executive officers is provided to you in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Report of the Compensation Committee later in this Proxy Statement. 
Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Governance and Nominating Committee performs the following functions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommends to the Board of Directors potential members to be added as new or replacement members to the Board of  Directors;  
• recommends to the Board of Directors the nominees for election to the Board of Directors at the annual shareholders  meeting;  
• reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation paid to  non-management Board members;  
• reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors matters regarding CEO succession plans;  
• reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the Corporate Governance Guidelines;   
• reviews the applicable legal standards for "independence" and the criteria applied to determine "audit  committee financial expert" status; and  
• reviews the answers to annual questionnaires completed by each of the Independent Directors.  
[END TABLE]
On the basis of this year's review, the Governance and Nominating Committee delivered a report to the full Board of Directors, and the Board made its "independence" and "audit committee financial expert" determinations. 
Board Member Meeting Attendance 
During the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, the Board of Directors held eight meetings. Each incumbent director, except Mr. Katzman, attended at least 75% of the aggregate total of meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees on which he or she served. Mr. Katzman attended all meetings of the Board of Directors subsequent to his appointment in January 2018. Also, all members of the Board of Directors except Messrs. Prado and Katzman attended the Company's 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. As set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines (http://brinker.com/corp_gov), directors are expected to attend the annual meeting. Such attendance allows for direct interaction between you and the Board members. 
Chairman of the Board 
The business and affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. Generally, it is management's responsibility to formalize, propose and implement strategic choices and the Board's role to approve strategic direction and evaluate strategic results, including both the performance of the Company and the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. 
The roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO for the Company are separated. Mr. DePinto serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that the current board leadership structure promotes the ability of the Board of Directors to exercise its oversight role over management by having a director who is not an officer or member of management serving in the role of Chairman of the Board, thus ensuring a continued significant role for independent directors in the leadership of the Company. This structure allows Mr. Roberts, as CEO, to focus his time and energy on leading and managing the Company's business and operations. An independent Chairman of the Board also simplifies the Company's corporate governance structure by allowing the Chairman of the Board to convene executive sessions with independent directors. The Chairman presides over all executive sessions. Any decision to change the structure in the future will be based on what the Board believes is the most effective and efficient structure for the Company. 
The Chairman of the Board's duties include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• creating and maintaining an effective working relationship with the CEO and management;  
• managing the relationship between the Board as a whole and the CEO and management;  
• providing significant advice, counsel and guidance to the CEO and management on strategic priorities and execution  strategies;  
• facilitating discussions among the directors inside and outside the Board meetings;  
• driving practices and improvements on Board effectiveness and productivity;  
• briefing the CEO on issues raised in executive sessions;  
• presiding at all meetings of the Board of Directors;  
• in collaboration with committee chairs and the CEO, scheduling Board meetings, setting meeting agendas and strategic  discussions, and providing review of pre-meeting materials delivered to directors;  
• overseeing annual Board and Board Committee evaluations;  
• delivering the annual CEO evaluation;  
• overseeing all governance matters for the Board and shareholders;  
• being available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders; and  
• carrying out other duties requested by the CEO and the Board as a whole.  
[END TABLE]
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risks, including the Company's enterprise risk management process that monitors and manages key business risks facing the Company. Throughout the fiscal year, the Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company's strategic, financial and operational risks. The Committee oversees the management of risks relating to the Company's compensation policies and practices. The Audit Committee oversees the management of risks associated with accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and internal control over financial reporting, as well as the effectiveness of the Company's enterprise risk management process. The Audit Committee also oversees cyber security and data protection issues, receiving quarterly updates from the Company's Chief Digital Officer and reviewing the findings of the Company's annual risk assessment and penetration test. The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the Company's registered public accounting firm, and the performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and internal audit function. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing the guidelines and policies governing the process by which senior management and the internal auditing department assess and manage the Company's exposure to risk, as well as the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees risks associated with the independence of the Board of Directors and the Company's governance structure. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through updates provided at full Board meetings, attendance at committee meetings, and committee reports about such risks. 
Directors' Compensation 
The Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews and periodically benchmarks the Board's compensation to assure that non-employee directors are being fairly and reasonably compensated in relation to the restaurant industry and to comparable U.S. companies. The same proxy peer group used for the Board is used for our named executive officers ("NEOs") (identified in more detail in the Benchmarking section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this Proxy Statement). For fiscal 2018, non-employee directors of the Company received the following compensation in addition to reimbursement for costs incurred in attending meetings of the Board: 
Annual Retainer 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-employee Chairman of the Board:  
[END TABLE]
An annual retainer of $250,000 was granted in restricted stock units, as elected. 
A 25% match in restricted stock units was granted for the annual compensation taken in restricted stock units. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All other non-employee directors:  
[END TABLE]
An annual retainer of $60,000 was paid or granted in a combination of cash or restricted stock units, as elected. 
A 25% match in restricted stock units was granted for the portion of annual compensation taken in restricted stock units. 
Annual Grant (all non-employee directors, including Chairman) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual grant of restricted stock units at a target value of approximately $100,000 was made.  
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Unit Distribution Timing 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors elected, prior to the grant, one of four distribution timing options for their restricted stock units:  (i) four years after date of grant, (ii) the director's departure from the Board, (iii) one year following the director's departure from the Board, or (iv) two years following the director's departure from the  Board. Directors also have the ability to defer receipt of restricted stock units that would otherwise be distributed for additional 5-year period(s), provided they elect to defer those units at least 12  months before the previously-scheduled distribution date.  
[END TABLE]
Providing a combination of equity and cash provides incentive for our directors to focus on long-term performance and shareholder value while still recognizing their energy and effort throughout the year. Each director has a choice among cash and restricted stock units for the annual retainer, thus allowing each director to receive compensation in a manner that best fits individual needs. However, both the Board and management believe it is important that each director maintain an equity stake in the Company therefore, an incentive is provided for any portion of the annual retainer taken in equity. 
Equity grants are made on the first business day of the calendar year following the annual shareholders meeting. For fiscal 2018, directors received restricted stock units for all of their equity compensation with variable distribution dates ranging from four years after grant to two years following departure from the Board (as described above in this section). 
Board Committee Retainers 
Committee members receive the following supplementary annual retainer for accepting their responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each member of the Audit Committee received $20,000 (paid in quarterly installments);  
• Each member of the Compensation Committee received $12,500 (paid in quarterly installments); and  
• Each member of the Governance and Nominating Committee received $10,000 (paid in quarterly installments).   
[END TABLE]
Additionally, the Committee Chairs received a further supplementary retainer for accepting the additional Chair responsibilities as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chair of the Audit Committee received an annual retainer of $15,000;  
• Chair of the Compensation Committee received an annual retainer of $12,000;  
• Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee received an annual retainer of $10,000; and  
• Lead Director (if Chairman of the Board is an employee director) received an annual retainer of $25,000.   
[END TABLE]
Directors are expected to attend the Board and their respective Committee meetings. No additional compensation was paid for attendance at these meetings. 
The stock ownership guidelines applicable to our Directors are set forth in the Stock Ownership Guidelines table of this Proxy Statement.

• Mr. DePinto, as Chairman of the Board, was also granted 3,167 restricted stock units, representing $125,000 of his  annual retainer required to be taken in restricted stock units;  
• A 25% match in kind was granted on any portion of the annual retainer converted to restricted stock units. Ms. Boltz  and Messrs. DePinto, George, Giles, Lopez, Mrkonic and Prado elected to receive their entire annual retainers in restricted stock units.

Communications with the Board of Directors 
If you or any other interested party wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors as a group or with an individual director, you or the interested party may direct such communications to the intended recipient in care of the General Counsel, 6820 LBJ Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75240. The communication must be clearly addressed to the specific group or director. Your Board of Directors has instructed the General Counsel to review and forward any such correspondence to the appropriate person or persons for response. 
Qualifications to Serve as Director 
Each candidate for director must possess at least the following specific minimum qualifications: 
1. Each candidate shall be prepared to represent the best interests of all the Company's shareholders and not just one particular constituency. 
2. Each candidate shall have demonstrated integrity and ethics in both personal and professional settings and have established a record of professional accomplishment in their chosen field. 
3. No candidate shall have any material personal, financial or professional interest in any present or potential competitor of the Company. 
4. Each candidate shall be prepared to participate fully in activities of the Board of Directors, including active membership on at least one Committee of the Board of Directors and attendance at, and active participation in, meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committee(s) of the Board of Directors of which he or she is a member, and not have other personal or professional commitments that would, in the Governance and Nominating Committee's sole judgment, interfere with or limit their ability to do so. 
5. In addition, the Governance and Nominating Committee also desires that candidates possess the following qualities or skills: 
(a) Each candidate shall contribute to the overall diversity of the Board of Directors—diversity being broadly construed to mean a variety of opinions, perspectives, personal and professional experiences and backgrounds, such as gender, race and ethnicity differences, as well as other differentiating characteristics. 
(b) Each candidate should contribute positively to the existing chemistry and collaborative culture among the members of the Board of Directors. 
(c) Each candidate should possess professional and personal experiences and expertise relevant to the Company's business. Relevant experiences may include, among other things, large company CEO experience, senior level multi-unit restaurant or retail experience, and relevant senior level experience in one or more of the following areas: finance, accounting, sales and marketing, organizational development, strategic planning, information technology and public relations. 
Although not an automatic disqualifying factor, the inability of a candidate to meet the independence and other governing standards of the NYSE or the SEC will be a significant factor in any assessment of a candidate's suitability. 
Board Assessments 
Our Board conducts an annual evaluation of itself and its committees to determine the Board's effectiveness and to identify ways in which to enhance effectiveness. Additionally, the Board conducts periodic evaluations of each of its members. The Board utilizes the feedback and results from these evaluations to determine the need for board refreshment, and the Governance and Nominating Committee utilizes the evaluation process as part of its determination of nominees recommended for election by shareholders at our annual meeting. 
Internal Process of Identifying Candidates 
The Governance and Nominating Committee uses a variety of means for identifying potential nominees for director, including the use of outside search firms and recommendations from current members of the Board of Directors and shareholders. In determining whether to nominate a candidate, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the current composition and capabilities of serving directors, as well as additional capabilities considered necessary or desirable in light of existing and future Company needs. One or more of the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee may interview, or have an outside search firm interview, a prospective candidate who is identified as having high potential to satisfy the expectations, requirements, qualities and responsibilities for membership on the Board of Directors. Prospective candidates may also be interviewed by other directors who are not members of the Governance and Nominating Committee. Reports from those interviews or from Governance and Nominating Committee members with personal knowledge and experience with the candidate, résumés, information provided by other contacts, and other information deemed relevant by the Governance and Nominating Committee are then considered in determining whether a candidate shall be nominated. The Governance and Nominating Committee also exercises its independent business judgment and discretion in evaluating the suitability of a candidate for nomination. 
Nomination Rights of Shareholders 
As a shareholder, you may recommend one or more candidates to be considered by the Governance and Nominating Committee as a nominee or nominees for election as director of the Company at an annual meeting of shareholders. To do so, you must comply with the notice, information, and consent provisions contained in the Company's Bylaws (current copies of the Company's Bylaws are available at no charge from the Secretary of the Company and may also be found in our public filings with the SEC). In order for the candidate recommendation to be timely for the Company's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, your notice to the Secretary of the Company must be delivered to our principal executive offices no later than May 29, 2019. Any such recommendations received by the Secretary will be presented to the Governance and Nominating Committee for consideration. Suitable candidates (whether identified internally or by a shareholder) who, after evaluation based upon the criteria and process described in "Internal Process of Identifying Candidates" above, are then recommended by the Governance and Nominating Committee and, if approved by the Board of Directors, will be included in our recommended slate of director nominees in our Proxy Statement. 
Current Nominations 
The Governance and Nominating Committee conducted an evaluation and assessment of all of the current directors, for purposes of determining whether to recommend them for nomination for re-election to the Board of Directors. After reviewing the assessment results, the Governance and Nominating Committee recommended to the Board that Messrs. DePinto, George, Giles, Katzman, Mrkonic, Prado and Roberts and Ms. Edelman be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. The Board accepted the recommendations and nominated such persons. The Governance and Nominating Committee did not receive any recommendations from shareholders proposing candidates for election to the Board at the annual meeting. 
Code of Ethics 
Our Code of Conduct and Ethical Business Policy applies to all members of the Board of Directors and our team members. The Code of Conduct and Ethical Business Policy is reviewed by the Governance and Nominating Committee annually and revised as appropriate. You may obtain a copy of the code free of charge in the Corporate Governance section of our website (http://brinker.com/corp_gov) or by written request directed to us at 6820 LBJ Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: General Counsel.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary 
Our compensation programs are structured to reinforce our strategies and company culture—to be a premier and progressive company with a balanced approach towards growing sales, increasing profits, bringing back guests and engaging team members. Our strategies and culture are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets around the world. 
Our fiscal 2018 compensation programs were designed to grow sales and profits while improving the guest experience through incentives based on adjusted net income ("Adjusted Net Income"), comparable same-restaurant sales ("Comp Sales") and food preparation speed ("Cook Times") in the case of the Profit Sharing Plan, and our compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") in adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") in the case of the Performance Share Plan. During the year, we cut our menu offerings by approximately a third compared to the prior year and focused on our core equities of burgers, ribs, fajitas and margaritas. This initiative improved kitchen efficiency and allowed our managers and cooks to deliver our food hotter and faster to our guests. We also invested in the quality of our food and brought bigger burgers and meatier ribs and fajitas to our guests. Additionally, we launched a margarita of the month platform that featured a new margarita every month at an every-day value price of $5.00. As fiscal 2018 ended, our average delivery time in the dining room had improved by approximately one minute compared to the year before, and our burger, fajita and margarita offerings were all growing. 
We remain competitive with our value offerings at both lunch and dinner and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a compelling every day value. We will continue to seek opportunities to reinforce value and create interest for the Chili's brand with new and varied offerings to further enhance sales and drive incremental traffic. 
Our progress this year enabled us to deliver against our goals with Adjusted Net Income of $166.7 million, Cook Times above target, and Comp Sales achievement below threshold, resulting in a short-term incentive payout of 89.6% of target to our CEO, CFO and the next three most highly compensated NEOs. 
2018 Compensation Highlights 
Following are some of the highlights of our fiscal 2018 executive compensation programs:

Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation programs are structured to reinforce our strategic principles—to be a premier and progressive company with a balanced approach towards growing sales, increasing profits, bringing back guests and engaging team members. Our programs also reflect the competitive environment in which we operate and align with a pay-for-performance philosophy. More specifically we: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use variable compensation plans to make up the majority of potential total compensation, placing significant amounts of  compensation "at risk;"  
• Establish incentive plan payout levels that provide an opportunity for participants to earn compensation above median  levels when performance goals are exceeded and our stock price increases, and significantly reduce compensation when our financial performance is below expectations or our stock price decreases;  
• Utilize both cash and equity elements with varying time horizons and financial metrics to motivate and reward sustained  performance that is aligned with shareholder interests but is not tied to a single financial measure or measurement period that could result in unintended consequences;  
• Provide competitive levels of compensation to attract and retain the best qualified executive talent. Both the Committee  and our Brinker leadership team strongly believe that the caliber of our overall officer team makes a significant difference in our sustained success over the long-term; and  
• Link our officers' interests with the sustained performance of the Company by having executives satisfy stock  ownership guidelines; and  
• Allow actual compensation to vary based on performance.  
[END TABLE]
Structure and Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Directors. The Board has also determined that each Committee member meets the qualifications as a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and as an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Committee is responsible for aligning our compensation programs with our compensation philosophy of rewarding performance. Specifically, the Committee reviews and approves any compensation decisions regarding our key leadership group which includes our CEO and his direct executive reports and other key officers, including the Executive Officers (the "Brinker Leadership Team") identified in this Proxy Statement (with input from the CEO). The CEO does not provide input on his own compensation. Further information about the duties of the Committee can be found in the 
 Committee Charter, which is located on our website at http://brinker.com/corp_gov. To ensure the Committee is able to effectively carry out its responsibilities, it takes the following actions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retains an independent consultant (currently Pearl Meyer & Partners) ("Pearl Meyer") to advise on  executive compensation;  
• Benchmarks data, with the assistance of an independent third party, to determine competitive compensation levels based  on a peer group that represents both restaurant companies and those companies with whom we compete for talent. The peer group for each officer may vary depending on the nature and scope of their individual responsibilities;  
• Approves the design and performance metrics used in our incentive plans;  
• Reviews annually detailed compensation tally sheets for the NEOs;  
• Submits recommendations on the CEO's compensation to the full Board of Directors for approval and ratification;   
• Holds executive sessions (without our management present) at every Committee meeting; and  
• Provides recommendations on compensation-related proposals to be considered at the Company's annual meeting to the  full Board of Directors for approval.  
[END TABLE]
Say-on-Pay Feedback from Shareholders 
At the annual shareholder meeting in 2017, we submitted our executive compensation program for an advisory vote to you, our shareholders, and it received the support of over 98% of the total votes cast on the proposal. The Committee reviewed the results of the advisory vote while completing its annual review of each pay element and total compensation packages for our NEOs with respect to next fiscal year. As shareholder support for our current programs is strong, no changes were made based on the results of the advisory vote. 
Pay for Performance 
The Company's executive compensation programs are aligned with our business initiatives and have been designed to pay commensurate with the level of performance generated. This philosophy is most evident in the mix of pay used to compensate our executives. 
Our fiscal 2018 compensation packages for our CEO and other NEOs were heavily weighted towards variable compensation. The variable compensation awarded in fiscal 2018 included below target payment of an annual incentive under our short-term incentive plan, and the economic value of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance RSUs (at target) and one-time performance-based stock options. 
As the graphs below show, long term incentives constitute the largest portion of target total direct compensation for our CEO and other NEOs: 
Roles of the Compensation Committee, Consultants and Management 
The Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of the Brinker Leadership Team, including the NEOs. All compensation recommendations are reviewed and approved by the independent directors of the full Board. The Committee utilizes three sources during their evaluation process: (1) Pearl Meyer, the Board's independent consulting firm; (2) Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"); and (3) management. The Committee annually reviews the performance of all consultants. The Committee has also affirmatively determined that Pearl Meyer and Meridian are "independent" as required by the SEC and NYSE. 
Pearl Meyer has been retained by and reports directly to the Committee. Pearl Meyer does not have any other consulting engagements with management. The Committee regularly asks Pearl Meyer to provide independent advice on current trends in compensation design, including compensation levels, the merits of particular forms of compensation, relative weighting of compensation elements and compensation best practices. 
Meridian is also retained by the Committee and provides detailed benchmarking data based on our benchmarking peer group. Meridian does not have any other consulting engagements with management. Meridian generates an independent report that is utilized in determining compensation levels for the Brinker Leadership Team. A more detailed discussion of the benchmarking process is provided in the Benchmarking section below. Based on the benchmark data and individual performance, the CEO provides input and recommendations to the Committee in setting total compensation for the Brinker Leadership Team, excluding his own compensation. The Committee considers these data sources and applies its own independent judgment in establishing a total compensation program, comprised of base salary, short-term incentives targeted as a percentage of base pay and long-term incentives, which aligns the interests of the executives with those of our shareholders. 
Benchmarking 
Meridian provides market data regarding base salary, short-term incentive targets, long-term incentive values and total compensation. The benchmarking proxy peer group is carefully selected based on criteria including restaurant and brand product industries, operating structure, location and size. We were near the median in terms of revenue size as compared to our benchmarking proxy peer group. Proxy data from our benchmarking proxy peer group was blended with data from Meridian's database, as well as data from other restaurant companies that participate in the Chain Restaurant Total Rewards Association (CRTRA) Compensation Survey, to provide us with benchmark information that we believe accurately reflects the market in which we compete for executive talent. The following table lists the companies used in fiscal 2018 as our benchmarking proxy peer group: 
Benchmarking Proxy Peer Group 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BJ's Restaurants, Inc.   The Cheesecake Factory, Inc.   Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.

 CBRL Group, Inc.   McDonalds Corporation   The Wendy's Company 
 Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.   Panera Bread Company   Yum! Brands, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
Meridian's benchmark information was used to establish ranges for total compensation (base salary + short-term cash incentives + long-term equity incentives). We strive to be competitive in the marketplace by appropriately balancing all elements of compensation (short-term versus long-term and fixed versus variable) while recognizing our performance, as well as the individual's performance, criticality, experience, and internal equity. There is no fixed percentage which determines the mix between cash and non-cash compensation, but compensation is significantly weighted towards variable compensation (short- and long-term). The table below shows the percentage of fixed versus variable compensation elements for targeted total compensation.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation and Benefit Components 
For the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018, the principal components of compensation and benefits for our NEOs were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary  
• Short-Term Incentives  
• Long-Term Incentives  
• Retirement Benefits  
• Health and Welfare Benefits  
• Perquisites  
[END TABLE]
In the sections that follow we detail how each component of compensation is evaluated. It is important to note that, while each individual component is reviewed, all decisions are made in a total compensation context. 
Base Salary 
Base salaries provide our executives with a level of certainty about their compensation. Annually, we review base salaries during our benchmarking process. An individual's base salary is dependent on the size and scope of the position, his or her experience and, most importantly, his or her performance. 
For fiscal 2018, our CEO received no increase to his base salary. The other NEOs received a 4% merit increase on average. 
Short-Term Incentives 
Our Profit Sharing Plan is a non-qualified annual incentive arrangement in which all RSC team members, including the NEOs, and certain team members who work for a particular restaurant brand ("brand team member") participate. The plan measures both financial performance and achievement of key performance indicators ("KPIs"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At target, two-thirds of the award is based on financial performance and one-third of the award is based on KPIs.  
• The financial portion of the plan measures actual Adjusted Net Income versus target Adjusted Net Income. These targets  are established within the first quarter of our fiscal year by the Board and are designed to reinforce our focus on profitability and enhancement of long-term shareholder value.  
• KPIs are established during the first quarter of the fiscal year and align with our strategic goals. KPIs can include  such items as project implementations, guest satisfaction or employee engagement.  
[END TABLE]
For all of our NEOs, the financial performance portion of the short-term incentive is based on actual Adjusted Net Income. The maximum award that any individual can receive is 200% of his or her individual short-term incentive target, but minimum thresholds must be achieved to earn a payout. The table below details the actual short-term incentive payout versus target for the NEOs:

[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018 Profit Sharing Plan 
Financial Measure (2/3 Weighting): 
For fiscal 2018, the Committee established an Adjusted Net Income target which was consistent with our long-term goal of annual growth. The Company's net income was calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Consistent with prior years, and as permitted under the terms of the relevant underlying plan documents, the Committee can make adjustments to the Company's net income in order to include or exclude specified items, for example, restructuring and impairment costs, as determined by the Committee in it's sole discretion. During 2018 the committee adjusted the target net income to neutralize the impact of a decreased corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For 2018, the Actual Adjusted Net Income for the Profit Sharing Plan was $166.7 million compared to a target Adjusted Net Income for the Profit Sharing Plan of $168.9 million, resulting in partial (93.6%) achievement under the financial measure. 
KPI Measure (1/3 Weighting): 
For the Brinker Leadership Team, including the NEOs, the individual performance portion was based on two equally weighted KPIs: Cook Times and Comp Sales. The Company utilized the Cook Times metric as a KPI due to the focus at Chili's to enable our Hot and Fast initiative to improve the guest experience. The performance goal for Cook Times achieved above target performance. However, the Brinker Leadership Team did not meet the Comp Sales goal (missing sales by approximately 2%). This performance resulted in a 81.7% achievement under the individual performance metric for the Brinker Leadership Team. 
Payout: 
The resulting payout for NEOs was 89.6% of target based upon the goal achievement listed above and calculated as such: (2/3 x 93.6% actual Adjusted Net Income achievement + 1/3 x 81.7% KPI achievement). The formulas used to calculate both plan and actual performance are further outlined in our Profit Sharing Plan. 
Long-Term Incentives 
We grant a mix of stock options, performance shares and restricted stock units to all of our officers with the belief that meeting our long-term strategic goals will increase our stock price. Target long-term incentive values are determined by the Committee by analyzing benchmark data, performance, program cost and total compensation targets. Once the target value is established, the number of shares granted is based on delivering 50% of the value in performance shares, 25% of the value in stock options and 25% of the value in restricted stock units. Our equity programs give officers a stake in the potential rewards provided to shareholders as a result of officers' efforts. 
All equity-based awards, including stock options, are granted on the last Thursday of each August. The number of shares granted each year fluctuates based on our stock price and other equity unit valuation methods (Black-Scholes for stock options). However, the Committee will not grant equity compensation awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information so the grant date could change if such a case should occur. 
Performance Shares 
To balance out the volatility of stock options while still aligning participants with shareholder interests, we also grant performance shares. We target a certain value for each performance share grant. The number of performance shares granted is determined by the stock price at the date of grant, and is calculated using the formula of (A) targeted value of performance share grant divided by (B) the stock price at grant. 
Performance shares granted in fiscal 2018 will be earned based on our Compound Annual Growth Rate ("CAGR") in Adjusted EPS as compared to a targeted growth of 8.6% over a three-year measurement period. The Company's Adjusted EPS will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the underlying plan document, which allows the Committee to make adjustments to the Company's EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP in order to include or exclude specified items, for example, restructuring and impairment charges. During 2018 the Committee adjusted the fiscal 2018—fiscal 2020 Performance Share Plan to neutralize the impact of a decreased corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
The target award (which is granted near the beginning of the measurement period) is adjusted by the payout percentage which ranges from 0% to 200% (see chart below). To earn 100% of a target award, we must achieve 8.6% CAGR in Adjusted EPS over the measurement period. To determine earned shares, the number of performance shares awarded will be multiplied by the distribution percentage corresponding to the Company's CAGR at the end of the measurement period as compared to the target CAGR of 8.6% equating to a 100% distribution. The distribution percentage is determined using linear interpolation between 0.1% CAGR up to 17.2% CAGR (Ex. 15.1% CAGR = 175% earned share distribution), as demonstrated in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Company Adjusted EPS CAGR     Payout Percentage

    16.34%      190.00%  
 >=17.20%      200.00%  
[END TABLE]
Earned shares are further subject to continued employment through completion of the three-year performance period and are distributed shortly thereafter. Earned shares are not subject to further vesting requirements, although they may need to be retained to meet stock ownership guidelines (see discussion below). 
Prior to fiscal 2017, performance shares were earned based on Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") compared to a select group of publicly traded restaurant companies over a three-year measurement period. The peer group was based on those companies with whom we compete for investor dollars and executive talent (these companies are also used in our executive compensation benchmarking). TSR 
 is the measurement of the appreciation in the stock price for each company, plus dividends, if any. The target award (which was granted near the beginning of the measurement period) was adjusted by the payout percentage, which ranged from 0% to 175%. To earn 100% of an award, we had to rank at least 7th in our peer group. 
For the fiscal 2016—fiscal 2018 Performance Share Plan, participants earned a 20% payout. 
Stock Options 
Stock options are intended to motivate participants to increase our stock price as they only have value if the market price of our stock increases over the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The actual compensation realized from stock options is dependent on both the increase in our stock price and each participant's decision on when to exercise. Our stock options vest 25% per year over four years and have a term of eight years. We target a certain value for each stock option grant. The number of stock options granted is determined by the option fair value at the date of grant, and is calculated using the formula of (A) targeted value of stock option grant divided by (B) the grant date fair value as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation method. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted stock units are intended to align participants to increase our stock price while acting as a retention tool, with shares only vesting with continued employment for three years before cliff-vesting. The number of units granted is determined by the stock price at the date of grant, and is calculated using the formula of (A) the targeted value of the restricted stock unit grant divided by (B) the stock price at grant. 
Career Equity 
Career Equity was a restricted stock unit program that worked as a retention device since the shares only vest upon retirement (detailed information concerning our retirement provisions can be found below in the paragraph titled Retirement Definitions and Payouts). The program was discontinued after fiscal 2016, but some NEOs still have outstanding unvested restricted stock units related to this program. 
Retention and Other One-Time Equity Grants 
Retention Awards are grants of restricted stock units designed as a retention tool, with shares only vesting with continued employment for either three- or five-year cliff-vesting horizons. The number of units granted is determined by the stock price at the date of grant, and is calculated using the formula of (A) the targeted value of the restricted stock unit grant divided by (B) the stock price at grant. 
Executive Special Equity Awards (the "Performance-Based Options") were approved by the Committee to incentivize a select group including the CEO and two NEOs to continue leading the Company during a transformative period in the industry and to further align their compensation with Company performance and increases in shareholder value. All or a portion of the Performance-Based Options may vest in accordance with the following terms and conditions, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date: 
(i) One-half of the Performance-Based Options will vest at the end of the 2021 fiscal year of the Company if the Company achieves EPS (as defined in the Performance-Based Options Award Agreement) equal to or greater than the original target of $4.40 (the "2021 EPS Performance Condition") for the Company's 2021 fiscal year. Subsequent to the grant the Committee adjusted the 2021 EPS Performance Condition to neutralize the impact of a decreased corporate tax rate related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The new target requires achieving EPS equal to or greater than $4.86. 
(ii) One-half of the Performance-Based Options will vest at the end of the 2022 fiscal year of the Company if the Company achieves the original target of EPS equal to or greater than $5.00 for the Company's 2022 fiscal year (the "2022 EPS Performance Condition"). In the event that the 2021 EPS Performance Condition is not met in the Company's 2021 fiscal year, then all of the Performance-Based Options will vest at the end of the 2022 fiscal year of the Company if the 2022 EPS Performance Condition is satisfied during the Company's 2022 fiscal year. Subsequent to the grant the Committee adjusted the 2022 EPS Performance Condition to neutralize the impact of a decreased corporate tax rate related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The new target requires achieving EPS equal to or greater than $5.54. 
The Performance-Based Options have an exercise period of eight years from the date of grant. The Performance-Based Options award also provides for the acceleration of the Performance-Based Options following certain specified terminations of employment, including in connection with a change of control, death and disability. The Performance-Based Options do not allow for acceleration of vesting for early or normal retirement. 
The Committee approved a one-time grant of 100 restricted stock units each as compensation for the CEO and NEOs to sign a non-compete agreement. The shares only vest with continued employment for three years before cliff-vesting. 
Equity Compensation Plan Information 
The following table summarizes, as of June 27, 2018, the equity compensation plans under which we may issue shares of stock to our officers and team members under the Stock Option and Incentive Plan ("1998 Plan") and to directors under the 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Consultants ("1999 Plan"):

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We have stock ownership guidelines for our Board of Directors and our senior vice presidents and above, including the NEOs. Stock ownership aligns the interests of these officers and directors with shareholders and promotes good corporate citizenship. Guidelines are reviewed annually by the Board of Directors, including a comparison of market prevalence and guideline designs. 
The guidelines for all senior vice presidents and above, including all of our NEOs, define stock ownership to include the value of any shares currently owned; vested, in-the-money stock options (which are valued based on the "in the money" value of the stock option); the value of any unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units; and the value of one-third of any unvested performance shares. We include the value of one-third of the unvested performance shares because on average it is expected that at least one-third of the shares will vest over multiple performance cycles. 
The guidelines for our Board of Directors define stock ownership to include the value of any shares currently owned and the value of unvested restricted stock or restricted stock units. 
The guidelines are based on a multiple of base salary (annual retainer in the case of the Board) which is used to calculate the desired value of holdings by position and are as follows: 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Member      5X   
 CEO      6X   
 EVP or Brand President      4X   
 SVP      3X   
[END TABLE]
Officers, including the NEOs subject to the guidelines, have five years to accumulate the necessary shares. The five-year period begins on the date the officer is promoted to the applicable position. If, however, such officer was not previously an employee of the Company, then the officer will be provided six years to meet the guideline. Should any of these officers be below the guidelines after being in the program for five years (or six, as applicable), they may receive half of any short-term incentives in shares until the guidelines are met. Directors have four years to accumulate the necessary shares. Currently, all officers and directors are in compliance with the guidelines or have additional time to meet the guidelines pursuant to the standards described in this paragraph. 
The Company has a written insider trading policy that, among other things, prohibits its directors, officers and employees from engaging in short-sale transactions of Company securities, pledging Company securities, placing Company securities in margin accounts, or engaging in hedging transactions, including trading in any derivative security relating to Company securities. You may obtain a copy of the policy in the Corporate Governance section of our website (http://brinker.com/corp_gov). 
Retirement Benefits 
Savings Plans 
Our 401(k) Plan and Deferred Income Plan ("Deferred Plan") are designed to provide the Company's team members with a competitive tax-deferred long-term savings vehicle. The 401(k) Plan is a qualified 401(k) Plan and the Deferred Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. 
401(k) Plan 
All of our team members, including those who may be classified as highly compensated by the IRS, who have attained the age of 21 and completed both one year and 1,000 hours of service with the Company are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. We will match 100% of each participant's contribution for the first 3% of the participant's base salary and bonus and 50% for the next 2% of the participant's base salary and bonus up to the IRS limits. All Company contributions vest immediately. 
Deferred Plan 
The Deferred Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for all of our officers, including the NEOs. None of our NEOs currently participate in the Deferred Plan. 
Retiree Medical Benefits 
Select officers, including the NEOs, are eligible to receive retiree medical insurance from us if they meet our definition of retirement (described below in the section entitled Retirement Definitions and Payouts). This fully insured policy is paid for by both the retiree and the Company. The cost split between the retiree and the Company mimics that of the cost split for our active employees and their medical benefits. Currently, that percentage is approximately 70% of the cost paid by the Company and 30% of the cost paid by the participant. Participants are eligible to receive this coverage until age 65. 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
All of our salaried employees are eligible for health and welfare benefits, including the NEOs. Our salaried employees, including the NEOs, also receive term life insurance, short-term disability and long-term disability. The level of Company-provided coverage for the senior vice presidents and above, including the NEOs, is at a higher rate than other employees for some Company-provided benefits. We have provided detailed information in the chart below for the NEOs.

[END TABLE]
We provide our officers, including the NEOs, with perquisites that are generally intended to promote their well-being and efficiency. The Committee reviews the perquisites during our annual benchmarking process for reasonableness and consistency with competitive practice. We currently provide our officers (including the NEOs, with the exception of the CEO) with the following perquisites: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Car allowance  
• Financial planning allowance  
• Dining card  
• Annual executive physical  
• Mobile communication allowance  
• Health club reimbursement  
[END TABLE]
The CEO receives only a dining card, an annual executive physical and a mobile communication allowance. 
We do not own or lease any aircraft for the benefit of management. Providing perquisites separately and not rolling them into base salary ensures those dollars are not included in our calculations for benefits such as life insurance, or other programs that use base salary in their calculation such as the Profit Sharing Plan and our 401(k) Plan. 
Fiscal 2019 Considerations 
Consistent with prior years, the Committee recently conducted a detailed review of our compensation programs and benefits in comparison to our operating climate and the market as a whole. The Committee determined that we had an appropriate mix of compensation and benefits in place (cash, short-term incentives, stock awards, perquisites, and retirement plans). 
Tax Implications 
As one of the factors in the review of compensation matters, the Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment to the Company. The deductibility of some types of compensation for the CEO and other NEOs depends upon the timing of the vesting or exercise of previously granted rights. Prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compensation that satisfied conditions set forth under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to qualify as "performance-based compensation" was not subject to a $1 million limit on deductibility, and the limit did not apply to compensation paid to the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"). The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminates the performance-based compensation exception and additionally applies the limit to the CFO and certain former executive officers. However, it provides a transition rule with respect to remuneration which is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and which was not materially modified after that date. With the elimination of the exemption for performance-based compensation, we expect that we will be unable to deduct all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our CEO, CFO and our other NEOs covered by the new tax law, other than previously granted awards that comply with the transition rules. We monitor the application of Section 162(m) and the associated Treasury regulations on an ongoing basis and the advisability of qualifying executive compensation for deductibility. Notwithstanding the repeal of the exemption for "performance-based compensation," the Committee intends to maintain its commitment to structuring the Company's executive compensation programs in a manner designed to align pay with performance. 
Administration of Compensation Program 
The Committee's administration of the executive compensation program is in accordance with the principles outlined at the beginning of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The Committee believes that our compensation programs provide the necessary incentives and flexibility to promote our performance-based compensation philosophy while being consistent with our objectives. Our financial performance supports the compensation practices employed during the past year. No member of the Committee serves or previously served as an employee or officer of the Company. 
Recoupment Provisions 
Our individual plan documents and our grant agreements contain language stating that if the Board of Directors determines any fraud, negligence or intentional misconduct by an officer was a significant contributing factor to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, the Board or Committee shall take, in its discretion, such action as it deems necessary to remedy the misconduct and prevent its recurrence. Further, under Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley, if the Company is required to restate its financials due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct, the CEO and CFO must reimburse the Company for (1) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 36 months following the first public issuance of the non-complying document and (2) any profits realized from the sale of securities of the Company during those 36 months. 
Consideration of Prior Amounts Realized 
In furtherance of the Company's philosophy of rewarding executives for future superior performance, prior stock compensation gains (or the lack thereof) are not considered in setting future compensation levels. 
REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
The Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement. 
Respectfully submitted, 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

Compensation Policies and Practices As They Relate to the Company's Risk Management 
We believe that our compensation policies and practices for all team members, including officers, do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We believe that the Company has appropriate safeguards in place with respect to the compensation programs that assist in mitigating excessive risk-taking that could harm our value or reward poor judgment by our officers and team members. These safeguards include: managing pay opportunities to market levels through peer benchmarking; balancing performance focus between near-term objectives and long-term shareholder value creation; issuing equity awards that vest over multi-year time horizons; capping cash incentive plan payments; maintaining stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers; and no employment agreements. Furthermore, the Committee retains its own independent compensation consultant to provide input on executive pay matters, meets regularly, and approves all performance goals, award vehicles and pay opportunity levels. 
In fiscal 2018, the Committee reviewed the concept of risk as it relates to our compensation programs and determined that our programs do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee noted that long term incentives are predominately equity-based and tied to shareholder returns, market comparisons are used, ownership guidelines are applied, and the majority of variable pay is tied to Company performance.

  (a)  Mr. Roberts' "Other Compensation" only includes amounts for an annual executive physical, mobile  communication allowance and dining discount.  
  (b)  Represents benefit premiums paid to a third party for Company-provided life insurance, executive retiree medical  insurance and long-term care insurance.

(6)  On August 31, 2017, the Company granted 203,347 stock options to Mr. Roberts as part of his annual compensation, and  500,000 Performance-Based Options as an Executive Special Equity Award. Pursuant to the Plan, the maximum number of options that may be granted to an individual in a fiscal year is 500,000. Collectively, these grants exceeded this limit. The Company  has therefore determined, and Mr. Roberts has acknowledged, that 203,347 of the Performance-Based Options

     ("Excess Options") are null and void.

Therefore, in order to satisfy the original intent with respect to Mr. Roberts' compensation, the Committee intends to grant  Mr. Roberts appropriate equity incentive compensation awards at similar or comparable levels to the value of the Excess Options, taking into account the interests of the Company's shareholders and all relevant factors.

(1)  The amounts shown in column (c) reflect the minimum payment level under the Company's Profit Sharing Plan.  The minimum award level is 1% of target (d) and the maximum award (e) is 200% of target (d). Threshold is represented with minimum payout of plan, but zero payout is possible if threshold performance measures are not met.   
(2)  These restricted stock units were granted to NEOs as compensation for signing a  non-compete agreement as detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled Retention and Other One-Time Grants of this Proxy  Statement.  
(3)  These performance shares are detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled  Long-Term Incentives of this Proxy Statement. The amounts in columns (f)–(h) reflect the range of payouts under the plan. The August 31, 2017 date reflects the date the target awards were established for the performance shares. The  actual award will not be earned until the end of fiscal 2020. Threshold is represented with minimum payout of plan, but zero payout is possible if threshold performance measures are not met.  
(4)  These Performance-Based Options are detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section  titled Retention and Other One-Time Grants of this Proxy Statement. The amounts in columns (f)-(h) reflect the range of payouts under the plan. The actual award will not be earned until the end of  fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2022. Threshold is represented with minimum payout of plan, but zero payout is possible if threshold performance measures are not met.  
(5)  These restricted stock units represent a Retention Award as detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis  under the section titled Retention and Other One-Time Grants of this Proxy Statement. These shares vest after three years of continuous employment.  
(6)  The amounts shown represent the fair market value at grant date for financial reporting purposes in fiscal 2018 of  stock awards as determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718.  
(7)  Ms. Valade resigned as Executive Vice President and President of Chili's Grill & Bar on  September 14, 2018, and Mr. Roberts was appointed President of Chili's Grill & Bar on an interim basis on the same day. All of Ms. Valade's unvested stock and option awards were forfeited upon her resignation.   
(8)  On August 31, 2017, the Company granted 203,347 stock options to Mr. Roberts as part of his annual compensation, and  500,000 Performance-Based Options as an Executive Special Equity Award. Pursuant to the Plan, the maximum number of options that may be granted to an individual in a fiscal year is 500,000. Collectively, these grants exceeded this limit. The Company  has therefore determined, and Mr. Roberts has acknowledged, that 203,347 of the Performance-Based Options ("Excess Options") are null and void. The Committee, assisted by its independent compensation consultant, has reaffirmed in its  business judgment that the Excess Options were an integral part of Mr. Roberts' compensation and were aligned with the interests of the Company's shareholders. Therefore, in order to satisfy the original intent with respect to Mr.  Roberts' compensation, the Committee intends to grant Mr. Roberts appropriate equity incentive compensation awards at similar or comparable levels to the value of the Excess Options, taking into account the interests of the Company's  shareholders and all relevant factors.

Retirement Definitions and Payouts 
For those executives who remain with us for their career, we want to ensure they are able to benefit from their contributions to our long-term success. Therefore, we have defined retirement provisions that allow for post-employment benefits. Early retirement is defined as age plus years of service equals 70, with a minimum age of 55. Normal retirement is defined as age plus years of service equals 70, with a minimum age of 60; or age 65 (regardless of service). This definition is applied to all of our equity programs (except for Retention and other one-time equity grants), our retiree medical program, and our Profit Sharing plan.

CEO Severance and Change in Control Agreement 
During fiscal 2017, we entered into the CEO Severance and Change in Control Agreement (the "CEO CIC Agreement") to provide for severance pay in the event of (A) a termination without Cause prior to or more than two years following a change in control, or (B) a termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason within two years following a change in control. "Cause" and "Good Reason" are defined in the CEO CIC Agreement. Under the CEO CIC Agreement, the CEO will be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of: (i) 24 months of base salary (in the event of a termination without Cause prior to or more than two years  following a change in control) or 36 months of base salary (in the event of a termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason within two years following a change in control) plus (ii) an amount equal to the CEO's target bonus for  the year of termination under the applicable Company Profit Sharing Plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued payment by the Company of the CEO's health insurance coverage premiums for 18 months following the  CEO's termination.  
[END TABLE]
Payments under the CEO CIC Agreement are conditioned on the CEO abiding by certain restrictive covenants and executing a separation agreement and release in a form satisfactory to the Company. The treatment of the CEO's outstanding equity awards upon termination is determined in accordance with the applicable equity plan documents. 
NEO Change in Control Severance Agreements and Severance Plan 
During fiscal 2017 and early fiscal 2018, we entered into NEO Change in Control Severance Agreements (the "NEO CIC Agreements") with each of Ms. Valade, Mr. Provost, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Badgley, and adopted the Executive Severance Benefits Plan ("Severance Plan") for eligible executive employees of the Company (capitalized terms used below are defined in the NEO CIC Agreements and Severance Plan, as applicable). The Severance Plan provides certain benefits to Company executive officers who (i) are at the level of senior vice president or higher and are part of the Brinker Leadership Team of the Company (other than the CEO), (ii) have entered into a change in control severance agreement with the Company and (iii) are designated by the Committee to participate in the plan. 
Pursuant to the NEO CIC Agreements, in the event that the NEO is terminated without Cause prior to or more than two years following a change in control, the NEO will be entitled to receive the following severance under the Severance Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 18 months of the NEO's then current base salary;  
• annual bonus for the year of termination that the NEO would have been eligible to earn under the applicable Company  Profit Sharing Plan based on the actual Company performance if the NEO had remained employed; and  
• continued payment by the Company of the NEO's health insurance coverage premiums for 18 months following the  NEO's termination date to the same extent that the Company paid for such coverage immediately prior to the date of termination (the "COBRA Subsidy").  
[END TABLE]
Under the NEO CIC Agreements, in the event that the NEO is terminated without Cause or resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the agreement), in each case within two years following a change in control, the NEO will be entitled to receive, in lieu of any severance benefits under the Severance Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• (i) 24 months of the NEO's then current base salary, and (ii) an amount equal to the NEO's target bonus  for the year of termination under the applicable Company Profit Sharing Plan; and  
• the COBRA Subsidy.  
[END TABLE]
Payments under the NEO CIC Agreements and the Severance Plan are conditioned on the NEO abiding by certain restrictive covenants and executing a separation agreement and release in a form satisfactory to the Company. In the event of any termination or resignation as described in this section, the treatment of the NEO's outstanding equity awards will be determined in accordance with the applicable equity plan documents. 
Equity and Other Incentive Awards 
Beginning with awards granted in fiscal 2017, we removed single-trigger provisions that would result in the automatic full vesting of awards upon a change in control. The provisions were refined as detailed below with respect to awards granted to the NEOs in fiscal 2018 and beyond: 
Restricted Stock Units, Stock Options, and Performance-Based Stock Options: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Outstanding awards of restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based stock options do not become fully  vested upon a change in control (as defined in the applicable award agreement) unless the awards are not assumed or replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring entity or cease to remain outstanding immediately following the change in control.  If a participating NEO is terminated without Cause within 24 months following a change in control or terminates for Good Reason within 24 months following a change in control, all outstanding restricted stock units, stock options and  performance-based stock options become fully vested (and, in the case of stock options and performance-based options, exercisable) upon such termination.  
[END TABLE]
Performance Share Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance share awards under our fiscal 2018 Performance Share Plan do not vest upon a change in control (as defined  in the plan) unless the awards are not assumed or replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring entity in such a change in control, or cease to remain outstanding immediately following the change in control. Otherwise, upon a change in control,  the applicable measurement period (but not the performance period) will end and the performance calculations will be modified to account for the shortened measurement period. A participating NEO must remain employed through the end of the  performance period to earn such award, unless the NEO is terminated without Cause or terminates for Good Reason following the change in control, in which case the NEO will fully vest upon termination in the number of achieved shares determined based  on performance through the change in control date.  
[END TABLE]
Quantification of Termination Payments and Benefits 
The following tables reflect the amount of compensation that would be paid to each of our NEOs in the event of a termination of the executive officer's employment under various scenarios. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of June 27, 2018, and include estimates of the amounts that would be paid to each executive officer upon such executive officer's termination. The tables only include additional benefits that result from the termination and do not include any amounts or benefits earned, vested, accrued or owing under any plan for any other reason.

(1)  Mr. Badgley is not eligible for retirement as of the last day of the fiscal year.  
(2)  Severance payments shown are based on Mr. Badgley's NEO CIC Agreement. His agreement provides for 18 months  of severance upon a termination without cause or 24 months of severance upon a termination with a change in control.  
(3)  The profit sharing award shown was earned for fiscal 2018, but is unpaid as of the last day of the fiscal year.  Mr. Badgley's agreement provides for no less than a target profit sharing award to be paid upon termination related to a change in control, and an earned award to be paid in all other scenarios.  
(4)  In this scenario Mr. Badgley is able to retain a pro-rata portion of his  fiscal 2017 and 2018 option awards, a pro-rata portion of his performance share awards and a pro-rata portion of his restricted stock units. Mr. Badgley is only  able to retain the fiscal 2018 one-time retention award under the change in control, disability and death scenarios.  
(5)  The amounts shown here do not include the value of any vested equity awards. For more information on  Mr. Badgley's equity awards, please see the Fiscal 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table.  
(6)  Under all of the scenarios listed, the fiscal 2017 and 2018 performance shares reflect a target payout.   
(7)  Under our death and disability provisions, Mr. Badgley would retain his unvested equity.  
(8)  The Company provides term life insurance for Mr. Badgley at three times base salary with a maximum benefit of  $3,500,000.  
(9)  Amount shown assumes that Mr. Badgley would be on short-term disability for four months (the coverage allowed  under our plan based on tenure) and then long-term disability for two years.

CEO Pay Ratio 
The Committee believes executive pay must be consistent and equitable to motivate our team members to create shareholder value. The Committee reviewed a comparison of annual total compensation of the CEO to the annual compensation of the median team member who was selected from all team members who were employed (other than the CEO) as of the last day of fiscal 2018. 
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
To identify the median team member, we utilized total cash compensation paid during the year, and we annualized the compensation for any team members that were not employed by us for all of fiscal 2018. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because the substantial portion of our team members only receive cash compensation. The majority of team members work part-time and as such are not eligible for our bonus or equity plans, and don't work enough hours to participate in our company-paid benefit plans. 
After identifying the median team member, we calculated annual total compensation for the team member using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement. 
The compensation for our CEO in fiscal 2018 was approximately 339 times the median pay of our team members, as shown below:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The amounts shown represent all salary, wages or tips received during fiscal 2018. Our salaries are paid on a bi-weekly basis, and wages are paid bi-weekly based on hours worked.  
(2)  The amounts shown represent the fair market value at grant date of equity granted to the CEO in fiscal 2018 as  determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718. These amounts do not include any reduction in value for the possibility of forfeiture. Median Team Member is not eligible to participate in our equity plans.  
(3)  The amounts shown were earned under our fiscal 2018 Profit Sharing Plan. Details about the plan can be found in the  Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled Short-Term Incentives of this Proxy Statement. Median Team Member is not eligible to participate in our Profit Sharing Plan.  
(4)  The amounts shown in this column reflect the value of benefits and perquisites provided to the CEO during the year.  These include: dining discount, annual executive physical, mobile communication allowance, life insurance, executive retiree medical insurance, long-term care insurance, and company matching contributions to the qualified 401(k) plan. Median Team  Member is not eligible for any benefits.  
(5)  On August 31, 2017, the Company granted 203,347 stock options to Mr. Roberts as part of his annual compensation, and  500,000 Performance-based Options as an Executive Special Equity Award. Pursuant to the Plan, the maximum number of options that may be granted to an individual in a fiscal year is 500,000. Collectively, these grants exceeded this limit. The Company  has therefore determined, and Mr. Roberts has acknowledged, that 203,347 of the Performance-based Options are null and void.  
[END TABLE]
The compensation for our CEO in fiscal 2018 included a one-time grant of Performance-Based Options (detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the section titled Retention and Other One-Time Grants of this Proxy Statement) valued at $1,373,503. If that value is excluded from Mr. Robert's fiscal 2018 Total Compensation it provides a more normalized ratio of 271 times the median pay of our team members. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. Our management is responsible for our financial reporting process, including our system of internal control over financial reporting, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing independent audits of our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. The Audit Committee also is responsible for the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is composed solely of independent directors who are qualified for service under NYSE listing standards and SEC rules. 
In this context, the Audit Committee held discussions with our management regarding our audited consolidated financial statements. Our management represented to the Audit Committee that our audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Such discussions also involved an evaluation of the independence of KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with both management and KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB and discussed with KPMG LLP their independence in connection with their audit of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed key initiatives and programs aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of our internal and disclosure control structure. As part of this process, the Audit Committee continued to monitor the scope and adequacy of our internal auditing program, reviewing staffing levels and steps taken to implement recommended improvements in internal procedures and controls. The Audit Committee also reviews and discusses legal and compliance matters with management, and, as necessary or advisable, KPMG LLP. 
Based on the discussions with KPMG LLP concerning the audit, the independence discussions, and the financial statement review, and such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee approved the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year. 
Further, in accordance with its written charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for discussions with management relating to the Company's processes to monitor and minimize significant risks and exposures. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management progress on the Company's enterprise risk management processes, including the evaluation of identified risks and alignment of Company processes to manage the risks within the Company's approved strategies.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Under the securities laws of the United States, our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock are required to report their initial ownership of our common stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the SEC and to furnish us with copies of all such reports. Based on our review of the reports we received and other written communications, we believe that all filing requirements were satisfied during fiscal 2018, except for a Form 4 filing filed on November 13, 2017, reporting the distribution of restricted stock on November 6, 2017 to Charles A. Lousignont. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
It is our policy, where possible, to avoid transactions (except those which are employment related) with officers, directors, and affiliates. If we believe we should enter into any such transactions, we will do so on terms no less favorable to us than we could obtain from third parties, and such transactions will be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Company. Except as noted below, there were no transactions required to be reported. 
During fiscal 2018, we employed one family member of one of our executive officers as a full-time team member at one of our restaurants.

Who pays for the solicitation of proxies and how are they solicited? 
We pay the entire cost of the solicitation of these proxies. This cost includes preparation, assembly, printing, and mailing of this Proxy Statement and any other information we send to you. We may supplement our efforts to solicit your proxy in the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We may contact you using the telephone or electronic communication;  
• Our directors, officers, or other regular employees may contact you personally; or  
• We may hire agents for the sole purpose of contacting you regarding the proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If we hire soliciting agents, we will pay them a reasonable fee for their services. We will not pay directors, officers, or other regular employees any additional compensation for their efforts to supplement our proxy solicitation. 
Can I vote if my shares are held in "street name"? 
If the shares you own are held in "street name" by a bank or brokerage firm, your bank or brokerage firm, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. 
 In order to vote your shares, you will need to follow the directions your bank or brokerage firm provides you. If you do not give instructions to your bank or brokerage firm, it will still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain "routine" items, but will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain "non-routine" items. In the case of non-routine items, the shares will be treated as "broker non-votes," which are not counted as cast and have no effect on the outcome of the vote. Election of directors is not considered a routine matter. We urge you to give your bank or brokerage firm instructions on all proposals in this Proxy Statement. To be able to vote your shares held in street name at the meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from your bank or brokerage firm. 
How do I vote if my shares are held in the Company's 401(k) Plan? 
If all or some of the shares you own are held through the Company's 401(k) Plan, you may vote by phone or online by 11:59 p.m., EST, on November 12, 2018 or the Company's agent must receive your paper proxy card on or before November 12, 2018. 
What is "householding"? 
If you and others in your household own your shares in street name, you may receive only one copy of this Proxy Statement and the annual report. This practice is known as "householding." If you hold your shares in street name and would like additional copies of these materials, please contact us by mail at Brinker International, Inc., 6820 LBJ Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attn: Investor Relations, or by email at Investor.Relations@brinker.com or by phone at 972-980-9917. If you receive multiple copies and would prefer to receive only one set of these materials, please also contact your bank or broker. Brinker does not currently use householding for owners of record and will send notice to all owners of record before using householding. By using this method, we give all owners of record the opportunity to continue to receive multiple copies of these materials in the same household. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
In order for business to be conducted at the meeting, a quorum must be present. A quorum consists of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting. Shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy (including broker non-votes and shares that abstain or do not vote with respect to one or more of the matters to be voted upon) will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists. If a quorum is not present, the meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained. 
What vote is required to approve each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1: Elect Eight Directors  
[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of a majority of shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting is required to elect each of the eight nominees for director. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the voting for each of the nominees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2: Ratify Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the 2019 Fiscal Year   
[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation  
[END TABLE]
The approval, in an advisory, non-binding vote, of the compensation of the NEOs of the Company by a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting is sought. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this advisory, non-binding approval. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 4: Amendment of Company's Stock Option and Incentive Plan  
[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions are counted as votes cast and have the same effect as votes against the proposal. Broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this proposal. 
How will my proxy get voted? 
If you vote over the phone or online, or properly fill in and return a paper proxy card (if requested), the designated Proxies (Wyman T. Roberts and Christopher L. Green) will vote your shares as you have directed. If you submit a paper proxy card, but do not make specific choices, the designated Proxies will vote your shares as recommended by the Board of Directors as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" election of all eight nominees for director;  
• "FOR" ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 Fiscal  Year;  
• "FOR" approval in an advisory, non-binding vote of the compensation of  our NEOs; and  
• "FOR" amendment of Company's Stock Option and Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
How will voting on "any other business" be conducted? 
Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the annual meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement, if any additional business is properly brought before the annual meeting, your signed or electronically transmitted proxy card gives authority to the designated Proxies to vote on such matters in their discretion. 
Who will count the votes? 
We have hired a third party, Donnelley Financial Solutions, to judge voting, be responsible for determining whether or not a quorum is present, and tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Where can I find voting results of the meeting? 
We will announce general voting results at the meeting and publish final detailed voting results in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the meeting. 
May shareholders ask questions at the annual meeting? 
Yes, our representatives will answer your questions after the conclusion of the formal business of the meeting. In order to give a greater number of shareholders an opportunity to ask questions, we may impose certain procedural requirements, such as limiting repetitive or follow-up questions, limiting the amount of time for a question, or requiring questions to be submitted in writing. 
How do I submit a proposal for next year's annual meeting? 
If you have a proposal, other than a nomination for the Board of Directors, that you would like us to consider at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, you must submit your proposal to the Secretary of the Company no later than May 29, 2019 and must comply with the notice, information, and other provisions contained in the Company's bylaws.

BRINKER INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLAN 
SECTION 1 
GENERAL 
1.1 Purpose. The Brinker International, Inc. Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Plan") has been established by Brinker International, Inc. (the "Company") (i) to attract and retain persons eligible to participate in the Plan; (ii) motivate Participants, by means of appropriate incentives, to achieve long-range goals; (iii) provide incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with those of other similar companies; and (iv) further align Participants' interests with those of the Company's other shareholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common stock; and thereby promote the long-term financial interest of the Company and the Related Companies, including the growth in value of the Company's equity and enhancement of long-term shareholder return. 
1.2 Participation. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine and designate, from time to time, from among the Eligible Employees, those persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the Plan, and thereby become "Participants" in the Plan. In the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be granted any Award permitted under the provisions of the Plan, and more than one Award may be granted to a Participant. Awards may be granted as alternatives to or replacement of awards outstanding under the Plan, or any other plan or arrangement of the Company or a Related Company (including a plan or arrangement of a business or entity, all or a portion of which is acquired by the Company or a Related Company). 
1.3 Operation, Administration and Definitions. The operation and administration of the Plan, including the Awards made under the Plan, shall be subject to the provisions of Section 4 (relating to operation and administration). Capitalized terms in the Plan shall be defined as set forth in the Plan (including the definition provisions of Section 7 of the Plan). 
SECTION 2 
OPTIONS AND SARS 
2.1 Definitions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  The grant of an "Option" entitles the Participant to purchase shares of Stock at an Exercise Price  established by the Committee. Options granted under this Section 2 may be either Incentive Stock Options or Non-Qualified Stock Options, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. An  "Incentive Stock Option" is an Option that is intended to satisfy the requirements applicable to an "incentive stock option" described in section 422(b) of the Code. A "Non-Qualified  Option" is an Option that is not intended to be an "incentive stock option" as that term is described in section 422(b) of the Code.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  A stock appreciation right (an "SAR") entitles the Participant to receive, in cash or Stock (as determined  in accordance with subsection 2.5), value equal to all or a portion of the excess of: (a) the Fair Market Value of a specified number of shares of Stock at the time of exercise; over (b) an Exercise Price established by the Committee.   
[END TABLE]
2.2 Exercise Price. The "Exercise Price" of each Option and SAR granted under this Section 2 shall be established by the Committee or shall be determined by a method established by the 
A-1 
 Committee at the time the Option or SAR is granted, except that the Exercise Price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock as of the Pricing Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "Pricing Date" shall be the date on which the Option or SAR is granted. 
2.3 Exercise. An Option and an SAR shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such periods as may be established by the Committee. 
2.4 Payment of Option Exercise Price. The payment of the Exercise Price of an Option granted under this Section 2 shall be subject to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Subject to the following provisions of this subsection 2.4, the full Exercise Price for shares of Stock purchased upon  the exercise of any Option shall be paid at the time of such exercise (except that, in the case of an exercise arrangement approved by the Committee and described in paragraph 2.4(c), payment may be made as soon as practicable after the exercise).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  The Exercise Price shall be payable in cash or by tendering shares of Stock (by either actual delivery of shares or by  attestation, with such shares valued at Fair Market Value as of the day of exercise), or in any combination thereof, as determined by the Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  The Committee may permit a Participant to elect to pay the Exercise Price upon the exercise of an Option by  authorizing a third party to sell shares of Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax  withholding resulting from such exercise.  
[END TABLE]
2.5 Settlement of Award. Distribution following exercise of an Option or SAR, and shares of Stock distributed pursuant to such exercise, shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee may establish (including acceleration of vesting in the event of the Participant's death, disability, or involuntary termination or a change in control of the Company). Settlement of SARs may be made in shares of Stock (valued at their Fair Market Value at the time of exercise), in cash, or in a combination thereof, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, may impose such conditions, restrictions and contingencies with respect to shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option or an SAR as the Committee determines to be desirable. 
SECTION 3 
OTHER STOCK AWARDS 
3.1 Definition. A Stock Award is a grant of shares of Stock or of a right to receive shares of Stock (or their cash equivalent or a combination of both) in the future. The grant of a right to receive shares of Stock (or their cash equivalent or a combination of both) in the future may be done in such form as the Committee determines, including, without limitation, performance shares or restricted stock units. 
3.2 Restrictions on Stock Awards. Each Stock Award shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine. These may include continuous service and/or the achievement of performance measures. The Committee may designate a single goal criterion or multiple goal criteria for performance measurement purposes, with the measurement based on absolute Company or business unit performance and/or on performance as compared with that of other publicly traded companies. If the right to become vested in a Stock Award granted under 
A-2 
 this Section 3 is conditioned on the completion of a specified period of service with the Company and the Related Companies, without achievement of performance measures or other objectives being required as a condition of vesting, then the required period of service for vesting shall be not less than three years (subject to acceleration of vesting, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in the event of the Participant's death, disability, or involuntary termination or a change in control of the Company).

Subject to the overall limitation on the number of shares of Stock that may be delivered under the Plan, the Committee may use available shares of Stock as the form of payment for compensation, grants or rights earned or due under any other compensation plans or arrangements of the Company or a Related Company, including the plans and arrangements of the Company or a Related Company acquiring another entity (or an interest in another entity). 
4.6 Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. An Award may provide the Participant with the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Stock which may be either paid currently or credited to an account for the Participant, and may be settled in cash or Stock as determined by the Committee.

4.7 Payments. Awards may be settled through cash payments, the delivery of shares of Stock, the granting of replacement Awards, or combination thereof as the Committee shall determine. Any Award settlement, including payment deferrals, may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall determine.

4.10 Agreement With Company. At the time of an Award to a Participant under the Plan, the Committee may require a Participant to enter into an agreement with the Company (the "Agreement") in a form specified by the Committee, agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Plan and to such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, prescribe. 
A-5 
4.11 Limitation of Implied Rights. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Neither a Participant nor any other person shall, by reason of the Plan, acquire any right in or title to any assets,  funds or property of the Company or any Related Company whatsoever, including, without limitation, any specific funds, assets, or other property which the Company or any Related Company, in their sole discretion, may set aside in anticipation of a  liability under the Plan. A Participant shall have only a contractual right to the stock or amounts, if any, payable under the Plan, unsecured by any assets of the Company or any Related Company. Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute a  guarantee that the assets of such companies shall be sufficient to pay any benefits to any person.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  The Plan does not constitute a contract of employment, and selection as a Participant will not give any employee the  right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Related Company, nor any right or claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the  Plan, no Award under the Plan shall confer upon the holder thereof any right as a shareholder of the Company prior to the date on which the individual fulfills all conditions for receipt of such rights.  
[END TABLE]
4.12 Evidence. Evidence required of anyone under the Plan may be by certificate, affidavit, document or other information which the person acting on it considers pertinent and reliable, and signed, made or presented by the proper party or parties.

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company or any Related Company shall be by resolution of its board of directors, or by action of one or more members of the board (including a committee of the board) who are duly authorized to act for the board, or (except to the extent prohibited by applicable law or applicable rules of any stock exchange) by a duly authorized officer of the company. 
4.14 Gender and Number. Where the context admits, words in any gender shall include any other gender, words in the singular shall include the plural and the plural shall include the singular. 
4.15 Compliance with Section 409(A) of the Code. To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and any Awards granted hereunder are exempt from Section 409(A) of the Code or are structured in a manner that would not cause a Participant to be subject to taxes and interest pursuant to Section 409(A) of the Code. The Plan and any Awards granted hereunder shall be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

ACCELERATION OF EXERCISABILITY 
AND VESTING UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
Full or partial acceleration of vesting may occur in the event of death, disability or involuntary termination. The Committee may accelerate vesting, in whole or in part, under such circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate, but subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the transition rule, if applicable. 
Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, with regard to any Award of Options, SARs and Stock Awards to any Participant, unless the particular grant agreement provides otherwise, the Awards will not become immediately exercisable and vested in full upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined below and in the applicable award agreements) unless the awards are not assumed or replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring entity or cease to remain outstanding immediately following the change in control. 
The events below constitute a change in control ("CIC"):

AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
