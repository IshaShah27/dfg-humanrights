PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY SOLICITATION INFORMATION
The accompanying proxy is solicited by the board of directors of FAT Brands Inc., a Delaware corporation, for use at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders to be held at The Peninsula Hotel, 9882 South Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills, California, 90212, on December 11, 2018 at 8:30 am Pacific Standard Time, and at any adjournment or postponements thereof. If no contrary instruction is received, the signed proxy card returned by stockholders will be voted in accordance with the board of directors' recommendations. As of the date of this proxy statement, we are not aware of any matters to be voted on at the annual meeting other than as stated in this proxy statement and the accompanying notice of annual meeting of stockholders. If any other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, the proxy card gives discretionary authority to the persons named in it to vote the shares in their best judgment.
This proxy statement and accompanying proxy card were first sent to our stockholders on or about November 14, 2018.
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before its use by delivering to us (Attention: Secretary) no later than 5:00 p.m. local time December 10, 2018, a written notice of revocation, delivery of a duly executed proxy card bearing a later date, or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on November 5, 2018 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, is entitled to one vote. On the record date, there were 11,529,891 shares of common stock outstanding.
We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the annual meeting. Proxies may be solicited by our regular employees in person, or by mail, courier, telephone or facsimile. Arrangements also may be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons. We may reimburse such brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection therewith.
At the annual meeting, stockholders will vote on the election of two directors (Proposal 1) and the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2).
Stockholders representing a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote must be present or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum to conduct business at the annual meeting. The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock representing a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, present in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. With regard to the election of directors, if a quorum is present, then the two nominees receiving the greatest number of the votes cast at the annual meeting will be elected to the board of directors. Stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in electing directors.
An abstention occurs when a stockholder affirmatively instructs the vote to be withheld (by checking the "abstain," "withhold for all," or "exceptions" box on the proxy card) or when a stockholder who has not given a proxy is present at a meeting and does not cast a ballot. Shares subject to abstentions and broker nonvotes are considered to be present at the annual meeting, and, therefore, are counted toward establishing the existence of a quorum. Abstentions are not treated as votes cast, however, abstentions will have no effect on the election of directors, which outcome is determined by a plurality of the votes cast, or on the proposal to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm, which outcome is determined by a majority of the votes cast.
Any bank, broker or other fiduciary holding shares of common stock for the account of a customer who is the beneficial owner of those shares that does not receive specific instructions from the customer on how to vote has the power to vote those shares at its discretion in the election of directors, for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and for other routine matters for which it has not received voting instructions. Fiduciaries do not have discretionary voting authority, however, with respect to nonroutine matters. A "broker nonvote" occurs when a fiduciary may not vote, or give a proxy to vote, a customer's shares because the customer did not provide voting instructions with respect to a nonroutine matter. Because fiduciaries will have discretionary voting authority with respect to the election of directors and the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm, there will be no broker nonvotes with respect to those matters.
Our largest shareholder, Fog Cutter Capital Group Inc. ("FCCG"), has agreed to enter into a Voting Agreement with us, terminable by FCCG after five years from the date of consummation of our initial public offering ("the Offering"). Under the Voting Agreement, FCCG will agree, subject to certain conditions discussed below, to vote all of its stock in our company at annual and special meetings of our stockholders, and any actions taken by written consent of our stockholders, in the same proportion as the votes or consents cast by our other stockholders on all matters, except matters involving the sale, merger or change of control of the Company. A copy of the Voting Agreement is filed as an exhibit to our Regulation A Offering Statement on Form 1-A, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The obligations of FCCG under the Voting Agreement will be conditioned upon receipt from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") of a favorable private letter ruling confirming that, for United States federal income tax purposes, the voting arrangement provided in the Voting Agreement will not prevent FCCG from filing consolidated federal income tax returns with us and our subsidiaries. FCCG intends to submit such a request to the IRS promptly after the consummation of the Offering. The voting arrangement under the Voting Agreement will only become effective following FCCG's receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will issue such a private letter ruling regarding this voting arrangement.
Until such time that a favorable private letter ruling is received from the IRS, FCCG will form a special committee consisting of one or more directors of FCCG (the "Special Committee"). The members of the Special Committee will be delegated the authority by the Board of Directors of FCCG to vote in their discretion the voting stock in our company held by FCCG at all annual and special meetings of our stockholders and any actions taken by written consent of our stockholders, except with respect to matters involving the sale, merger or change of control of our company (which will be considered by the entire Board of FCCG).
PROPOSAL NO. 1ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
At the annual meeting, the stockholders will be asked to elect two directors to the board of directors, each to serve until the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. If a nominee is unable or unwilling to serve, the shares to be voted for such nominee that are represented by proxies will be voted for any substitute nominee designated by the board of directors. If a quorum is present at the annual meeting, the two nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast, in person or by proxy, will be elected to serve as directors. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will have no effect on the election of directors. The board of directors recommends a vote "FOR" the nominees for director listed below. If not otherwise specified, proxies will be voted "FOR" the nominees for director listed below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview of Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation programs and is responsible for establishing, implementing, and monitoring adherence to our compensation philosophy. Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate high-caliber executives and to focus the interests of the executives on objectives that enhance stockholder value. These goals are attained by emphasizing "pay for performance" by having a portion of the executive's compensation dependent upon business results and by providing our executives with equity interests in the Company. The principal elements of our executive compensation program include base salary, discretionary bonus and stock options.
Throughout this proxy statement, the individuals who served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during fiscal year 2017, as well as the other individuals included in the Summary Compensation Table below, are referred to as the "named executive officers."
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
The Compensation Committee believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals. Further, the Compensation Committee seeks to align executives' interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding performance at or above established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value and positioning the Company for future growth. The Compensation Committee evaluates both performance and compensation levels to ensure that the Company maintains its ability to attract and retain superior employees in key positions and that compensation provided to key employees remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of companies the Compensation Committee deems from time to time to be comparable in terms of size and goals. To align the goals of the Company's executives with the Company's objectives, the Compensation Committee believes executive compensation packages provided by the Company to its executives, including the named executive officers, should include both cash and stock-based compensation.
Neither the Company nor the Compensation Committee has retained a compensation consultant to review or advise on our policies and procedures with respect to executive compensation.

OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL 2017 YEAR END
2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
Our Board of Directors has adopted and approved the 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan is a comprehensive incentive compensation plan under which we can grant equity-based and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors of, and consultants and advisers to, FAT Brands and its subsidiaries. The purpose of the Plan is to help us attract, motivate and retain such persons and thereby enhance stockholder value. The Plan allows for management and the Board of Directors to award stock incentives to substantially all employees as a retention incentive and to ensure that employees' compensation incentives are aligned with stock price appreciation. The Plan provides for a maximum of 1,000,000 shares available for grant.
Administration. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Plan Committee").
Grant of Awards; Shares Available for Awards. The Plan provides for the grant of a variety of equity awards, including incentive stock options ("ISOs"), non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"), unrestricted shares, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance stock, performance units, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), tandem stock appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights, or any combination of the foregoing, to key management employees, non-employee directors, and non-employee consultants of FAT Brands (each a "participant") (however, solely FAT Brands employees are eligible for incentive stock option awards). To the extent that an award (or portion of an award) lapses, expires, is canceled, is terminated unexercised or ceases to be exercisable for any reason, or the rights of its holder terminate, any shares subject to such award shall be deemed not to have been issued for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate shares which may be issued under the Plan and shall again be available for the grant of a new award. However, shares that have actually been issued under the Plan shall not be available for future issuance under the Plan, unless unvested shares are forfeited or repurchased by FAT Brands at the lower of their original purchase price or their fair market value at the time of repurchase.
Amendment and Termination. The Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated pursuant to its terms, until the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors (except as to awards outstanding on that date). The Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time with respect to any shares for which awards have not theretofore been granted; provided, however, that the Plan's termination shall not materially and adversely impair the rights of a holder with respect to any award theretofore granted without the consent of the holder. The Board of Directors shall have the right to alter or amend the Plan or any part thereof from time to time; provided, however, that without a majority of our stockholders, no amendment or modification of the Plan may (i) materially increase the benefits accruing to holders, (ii) except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, materially increase the number of shares subject to the Plan or the individual award agreements, (iii) materially modify the requirements for participation, or (iv) amend, modify or suspend certain re-pricing prohibitions or amendment and termination provisions as specified therein.
The following table summarizes the outstanding equity award holdings of our named executive officers as of December 31, 2017.
Option Exercises and Stock Vested
None of the named executives acquired shares of the Company's stock through exercise of options during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Retirement Plans
We sponsor a 401(k) retirement plan that is available to all of our employees. Participants may make tax deferred contributions to the plan. We do not currently match any portion of employee contributions to the plan.
Employee Benefits and Perquisites
All of our full-time employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate in various health and welfare plans maintained by FAT Brands Inc., including:
Our named executive officers participate in these plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. We do not maintain any supplemental health and welfare plans for our named executive officers. We believe the benefits described above are necessary and appropriate to provide a competitive compensation package to our named executive officers.
No Tax Gross-Ups
We do not make gross-up payments to cover our named executive officers' personal income taxes that may pertain to any of the compensation or perquisites paid or provided by our company.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the board of directors. In setting director compensation, the Company considers the significant amount of time that our directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill-level required by the Company of members of the board of directors.
Effective October 20, 2017, we pay each non-employee director serving on our Board of Directors $40,000 in annual cash compensation, plus an annual equity award of 15,000 stock options or SAR's. To the extent that any non-employee director serves on one or more committees of our Board of Directors, we pay an additional $20,000 in cash compensation annually.
The terms of the equity awards described above are set forth in the 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.
The non-employee director compensation policy (including the compensation described above) may be amended, modified or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time in its sole discretion.
The following table sets forth a summary of the compensation we paid or accrued to our non-employee directors during 2017:
Explanatory Notes:
PROPOSAL NO. 2APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
A resolution will be presented at the annual meeting to ratify the appointment by our Audit Committee of Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, to examine our financial statements for the year ending December 30, 2018, and to perform other appropriate accounting services.
The Audit Committee engaged Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm on April 11, 2017. In addition, Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP had previously served as the independent auditors for Fatburger and Buffalo's. Prior to their appointment, we had not consulted with Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP regarding the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our consolidated financial statements.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and during the subsequent interim period ended September 30, 2018, there were no disagreements with Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved would have caused Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP to make references to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report. The audit report of Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
Representatives of Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP are expected to attend the annual meeting, or be available by telephone conference, to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if desired.
The aggregate accounting fees for the year ended December 31, 2017 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. The Audit Committee reviews the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm on an annual basis and has determined that Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP is independent. In addition, the Audit Committee pre-approves all work and fees that are performed by our independent registered public accounting firm.
The affirmative vote of the holders of common stock representing a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP. The board of directors recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of its appointment of Hutchinson and Bloodgood LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. If not otherwise specified, validly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" this proposal.
