California resources corporation 2019 proxy report and notice of annual meeting
Letter to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Board
Dear Shareholders,
Strong execution, financial discipline and sustained community engagement are compelling hallmarks of California Resources Corporation ("CRC"), reflecting the Company's core values of Character, Responsibility and Commitment and the high expectations set by the Board of Directors (the "Board").  In 2018, CRC achieved strong results through the exceptional leadership of our management team and the dedication of our diverse workforce who operate critical infrastructure and supply essential resources to Californians with an innovative and entrepreneurial mindset.  With the Board's active direction, CRC thoughtfully navigated a volatile pricing environment with a dynamic and flexible operating plan that prioritized projects to deliver value both in the immediate and longer term, while continuing to meaningfully strengthen our financial position.  We believe this value-driven approach to managing our business truly sets CRC apart.  It enables us to capture the full value of our robust portfolio of assets throughout the commodity cycle and ensures effective capital allocation that delivers positive results for our shareholders.  Coupled with an unwavering focus on operational excellence that unifies the organization, it is a powerful strategic approach that sustains CRC's high levels of safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and quality.  
In 2018, an engaged Board aligned with shareholder priorities brought to bear a wealth of experience and varied perspectives from within the energy industry, as well as from financial services, accounting, real estate, human resources and organizational disciplines.  To ensure that CRC continues to attract and maintain the most effective mix of Board talent, we regularly engage in a review process to evaluate desired skill sets that strengthen governance, promote diversity of thought, and align with the evolving demands of our business.  In 2018, Laurie Siegel joined our Board.  Her breadth of experience as a human resources executive and public company director strengthens our Board's diversity of relevant skills in the areas of talent management, succession planning, organizational capability, and corporate culture.  
Our commitment to investor outreach and engagement continues on numerous fronts.  Consistent with investor feedback, we are once again proposing to eliminate CRC's supermajority thresholds in its certificate of incorporation.  While these efforts failed to reach the requisite vote last year, many shareholders regarded the action favorably and encouraged CRC to provide shareholders with another opportunity to vote on this governance measure this year.  Additionally, we received supportive shareholder feedback around our executive compensation practices, fostering a transparent and balanced approach that both aligns with industry practices and rewards executives appropriately based on specific quantitative annual and multi-year performance metrics, as well as progress toward longer-term organizational objectives, including our 2030 Sustainability Goals. 
As a responsible California oil and natural gas company operating in the world's fifth largest economy, CRC promotes safety first, with the protection of people, our communities and the environment as our top priority in the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our facilities.  This commitment to California values is implemented through our statewide Project Labor Agreement that ensures our facilities are built and maintained by a highly-qualified local workforce.  It is reflected in our ongoing dialogue with neighbors, regulators and other stakeholders, as well as through investments that promote conservation of water, habitat and energy throughout our operations.  The Board holds the management team and our entire workforce accountable for these principles by measuring CRC's progress annually with quantitative safety, spill prevention and water conservation metrics that directly affect incentive compensation of our employees.  In addition, management works to advance our Board's 2030 Sustainability Goals, which include specific quantitative targets for water recycling, reduction of methane emissions, renewable power and carbon capture and storage.  We have already implemented several projects that have increased our volume of recycled produced water and reduced methane emissions compared to a 2013 baseline.  The Company also facilitates numerous large-scale solar power projects in several oil and gas fields through surface use agreements, in addition to designing CRC owned and operated solar projects on two of our properties.  Our sustainability efforts are further supported by the ongoing development of an innovative carbon capture and sequestration system at our Elk Hills field.  In these ways, we are proud to work together with the State of California to fulfill our shared commitment to conserve natural resources and protect our environment.  
While stakeholders often think about sustainability in environmental terms, we believe diversity is also a key success factor for our business and for California's future.  We view diversity holistically, from the composition of our Board and management to growing and developing our workforce to reflect the communities where we operate.  CRC's employee-led Women's Interest Network provides professional development and support to women throughout our operations with strong support and participation from the Board and management.  Our community outreach efforts similarly champion inclusivity – from an array of childhood health, education and training programs to civic empowerment of diverse communities – because at our core, we believe that CRC succeeds when Californians thrive.
Helping meet the needs of Californians positions CRC to create and sustain value for our shareholders for years to come.  Our confidence in the future is due in no small part to CRC's extraordinary workforce.  Our employees embrace an entrepreneurial "OneCRC" mindset that promotes innovative thinking, increased collaboration and accountability, and a focus on process improvements in everything we do.  We expect this to translate into continued growth for shareholders as we manage our assets for margin expansion and cash-on-cash returns using our value-driven approach in 2019 and beyond.
Regards,
William "Bill" Albrecht
Chairman of the Board
California Resources Corporation

    ✓  Renewed Effort: Supermajority votes. Based on shareholder feedback, the Board is resubmitting for approval proposals to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to reduce the current supermajority voting thresholds to majority votes. 
    ✓  Overboarding Policy. The Board implemented a policy to restrict directors who are currently sitting CEOs of public companies from serving on more than two other public company boards without approval, subject to a related company analysis, as applicable.  
    ✓  Majority vote standard. Our Bylaws provide that each director must be elected by a majority of votes cast, not a plurality, in uncontested elections. 
    ✓  Clawback Policy. The Board adopted a comprehensive, standalone policy that covers cash, equity, equity-based and other awards under our incentive compensation programs. 
    ✓  Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy. The Board expanded our Insider Trading Policy to specifically address the hedging or pledging of our securities.  
    ✓  Board is not classified. Our directors are elected on an annual basis. 
    ✓  Separate Chairman of the Board and CEO. 
    ✓  8 out of 10 Board members are independent. The Board has determined 8 out of 10 Board members are independent within the meaning of NYSE listing standards. 
    ✓  Independent lead director. 
    ✓  Independent Board committees. Each standing committee is made up of independent directors. Each standing committee operates under a written charter that has been approved by the Board and is available to stockholders. 
    ✓  Each committee has the authority to retain independent advisors.

Compensation Program Highlights
CRC's stock price performance in 2018 was the highest of our peer companies. However, our stock price generally remained at depressed levels, driven in large part by the highly leveraged balance sheet our management team inherited from Occidental Petroleum Corporation ("Occidental") at our Spin-off from Occidental (the "Spin-off"), and continued to impact the realizable compensation for our named executive officers. For 2018, our Compensation Committee realigned the long-term compensation to stockholder returns by returning to entirely share-based long-term incentive awards. 
2018 Compensation Actions
In the first quarter of 2018, based on feedback received from stockholder outreach, the Compensation Committee took the following actions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reduced the individual portion of the annual incentive to 20%. 
• Redesigned the performance-based long-term incentive awards to be entirely stock-based, further aligning the most significant executive compensation opportunity with stockholders. 
• Reduced the portion of time-vested restricted stock unit awards from 50% to 40% of the grant date value of the long-term incentive awards and instead granted premium priced stock options, shifting the long-term incentive program to 60% performance-based.

Proxy Statement Summary 
Compensation Program Practices
Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate our executives to take actions that are aligned with our short- and long-term strategic objectives, appropriately balancing risk versus potential reward. It is well designed, incorporating best practices, and is governed by an engaged Compensation Committee. Our short-term and long-term incentive plans are performance-based and are intended to align with the long-term best interests of stockholders and retain our highly experienced, high-performing management team.
The Compensation Committee has engaged in best practices to align executive pay with Company performance and to ensure good governance in the following ways:
WHAT WE DO We pay for performance. A significant portion of the compensation of our named executive officers is directly linked to the Company's performance, by way of a compensation structure that includes performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. We are stockholder-aligned. Annual and long-term incentive awards are based on performance measures that are aligned with the creation of value for our stockholders. A majority of the outstanding long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers are stock-based.  We have "double trigger" change in control provisions. Our change in control arrangements for named executive officers require both the occurrence of a change in control event and termination of employment before applicable vesting of awards occurs. We provide market-competitive compensation. Our compensation program is competitive within our industry and recognizes evolving governance practices, which allows us to attract and retain key talent. We have stock ownership requirements. We maintain stock ownership guidelines which require our named executive officers and directors to have meaningful stock ownership in the Company. We have a clawback policy. Our Compensation Recoupment and Clawback Policy allows the Company to require reimbursement of incentive compensation in certain circumstances. We seek independent advice. The Compensation Committee retains an independent advisor to review executive compensation and provide advice to the Compensation Committee. 
WHAT WE DON'T DO We do not have individual employment agreements. We do not have employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. We do not allow hedging or pledging. Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits certain transactions involving our stock, including hedging and pledging. We do not allow the repricing of stock options. Our equity incentive plan prohibits the repricing or backdating of stock options. We do not offer enhanced retirement benefits. Our nonqualified defined compensation plan provides restorative, but not enhanced, retirement benefits for executives. We do not encourage excessive risk or inappropriate risk taking through our incentive programs. Our plans do not motivate executives to engage in activities that create excessive or inappropriate risk for the Company.

A diverse board enables a more balanced, wide-ranging discussion in the boardroom, and is also important to the Company's stockholders, its management and employees.

In 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Ms. Siegel as a director, which further diversified the board.

Director Independence Determinations
[BEGIN TABLE]
 To qualify as "independent" under the NYSE listing standards, the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with us) that would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. The NYSE independent director criteria include, among other things, that the director not be our employee and not have engaged in various types of business dealings with us.

The Board of Directors has reviewed all direct or indirect business relationships of which it is aware between each director (including his or her immediate family) and us, including those relationships described under "Related Party Transactions" below, as well as each director's relationships with charitable organizations, to assess director independence as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. Based on this evaluation, the Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Gannon, Korell, McMahon, Moncrief, Poladian and Sinnott and Mses. Powers and Siegel are independent directors as that term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. Neither Mr. Albrecht, the Chairman of the Board, nor Mr. Stevens, the President and Chief Executive Officer, is considered by the Board of Directors to be an independent director because of his prior or current employment with CRC.

Board Leadership Structure and Committees
Chairman
The Board of Directors' leadership structure separates the CEO and Chairman of the Board positions. Mr. Stevens currently serves as our President and CEO, and Mr. Albrecht serves as our non-executive Chairman.
The Board of Directors believes that there is no single, generally accepted approach to providing board leadership and that each of the possible leadership structures for a board must be considered in the context of the individuals involved and the specific circumstances facing a company, as the right leadership structure may vary as circumstances change. The Board of Directors believes it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders at this time to have separate CEO and Chairman positions, and have an independent director serve as Lead Independent Director working in conjunction with the Chairman. The Board of Directors has found that this structure enables the CEO to focus on operation of the Company's business, while the Chairman and Lead Independent Director focus on leading the Board of Directors in its oversight role.
Lead Independent Director
The Board of Directors has created the position of Lead Independent Director, selected annually by the Board from among the independent directors. Mr. Korell has served as Lead Independent Director since December 2014, and the Board selected him to continue in this position at the meeting in February 2019. The Board of Directors believes that the Lead Independent Director position provides additional independent oversight for the Board and management. The responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director include acting as chair at meetings of the Board of Directors when the Chairman is not present, and preparing the agenda and presiding over executive sessions of the non-management directors of the Board of Directors.
Board Meetings and Attendance
During 2018, the Board of Directors held six meetings, and each of the standing committees held the number of meetings included in the description of the committees set forth below. Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which he or she served that occurred during such directors' terms in 2018. 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are encouraged to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. Nine then-incumbent directors attended the annual meeting in May 2018. 
Executive Sessions of the Board
The Board of Directors intends to hold regularly scheduled meetings of independent directors in executive session without management present in conjunction with each regular board meeting. In addition to these regularly scheduled meetings, executive sessions may be called upon the request of any independent director. In 2018, the Board of Directors held executive sessions on the day of all of the regularly scheduled board meetings.

Communications with Directors
Our Board of Directors welcomes communications from our stockholders and other interested parties. Communications to our Board of Directors, to any committee of our board, to the Lead Independent Director (who presides over the executive sessions of our independent and non-management directors), or to any director in particular, should be sent to:
Board of Directors, committee name or director's name, as appropriate
California Resources Corporation
Attention: Corporate Secretary
27200 Tourney Road, Suite 315
Santa Clarita, California 91355
We will forward all correspondence directly to the committee or individual director, as appropriate. Our independent directors approved our process for collecting and organizing stockholder communications to the Board of Directors.
If any stockholder or third party has a complaint or concern regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters at CRC, they should send their complaint in writing to Mr. Gannon, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, at the address listed above.
Availability of Corporate Governance Documents
We are committed to good corporate governance. In furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors has adopted governance documents to guide the operation and direction of the Board and its committees, which include Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Business Ethics Policy (which applies to all directors and employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer) and charters for the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance and Health, Safety and Environmental Committees. Each of these documents is available on our website (www.crc.com), and stockholders may obtain a printed copy, free of charge, by sending a written request to California Resources Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 27200 Tourney Road, Suite 315, Santa Clarita, California 91355. We will also promptly post on our website any material amendments to these documents and any waivers from the Business Ethics Policy for our directors and principal executive, financial and accounting officers.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Policies and Procedures
Our Board of Directors adopted written policies regarding related party transactions. We review all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. Our Corporate Secretary's office implements procedures to obtain information from the directors and executive officers with respect to related party transactions. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and the independent registered public accounting firm any material related party transactions as defined by, and required to be disclosed under, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the NYSE. Agreements that embody transactions that are material in amount or significance are filed with the SEC as required.
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION    20
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Our business ethics and corporate policies prohibit significant conflicts of interest. Any waivers of these policies require approval by the compliance officer, or in the case of conflicts of our executive officers or directors, the Board of Directors. Under our Business Ethics and Corporate Policies, conflicts of interest generally are deemed to occur when private or family interests do not appear impartial, interfere or compete with the interests of our Company.
We have multiple processes for reporting conflicts of interests and related party transactions. Under our Business Ethics and Corporate Policies, all of our directors and employees are required to report any known or apparent conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, to their supervisors, the compliance officer, a member of the corporate compliance committee, our legal counsel, human resources, or the Board of Directors, as appropriate. As part of any review of any conflict of interest, potential conflict of interest or related party transaction, the following factors are generally considered:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction; 
• the material terms of the transaction; 
• the importance of the transaction to the related person; 
• the importance of the transaction to us; 
• whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act or their ability to act in our best interest; 
• whether the transaction might affect a director's independence under NYSE standards; and 
• any other matters deemed appropriate with respect to the particular transaction. 
[END TABLE]
We also have other policies and procedures to prevent conflicts of interest and related person transactions. For example, the charter of our Nominating and Governance Committee requires that the committee members assess the independence of the non-management directors at least annually, including a requirement that it determine whether any such directors have a material relationship with us, either directly or indirectly, as defined therein and as further described above under "Director Independence Determinations."
Related Party Transactions
This section discusses transactions and relationships with related persons since the beginning of our most recently completed fiscal year.
Marketing Transactions
We sell and purchase products with subsidiaries of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ("Plains"). Funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors L.P., of which Mr. Sinnott serves as co-chairman, and affiliates ("Kayne Anderson") own approximately 10% of the general partner of Plains, approximately 1.41% of the limited partner units of Plains and an additional approximately 5.04% general partner interest in Plains GP Holdings, L.P. (the public portion of the general partner). Mr. Sinnott serves as a director for the general partner of Plains. For the year ended December 31, 2018, transactions with Plains accounted for approximately $181 million of our net sales.
Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons
Certain funds controlled by Kayne Anderson Investment Management, Inc. ("Kayne Anderson Investment"), of which Mr. Sinnott serves as President, purchased in 2016, and as of December 31, 2018 continued to hold, approximately $12.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our 8% secured second lien notes due 2022. Mr. Sinnott did not participate in Kayne Anderson's decision-making process with respect to these transactions.

Other Governance Matters
Shareholder Engagement
In 2018, we reached out to our largest shareholders, including those who held in aggregate over one-third of our total outstanding shares, for meetings on corporate governance issues.   In the meetings that were arranged, we discussed recent governance changes, board refreshment and diversity practices, and compensation philosophy.  We also asked about broader trends and practices on corporate governance for Board feedback and consideration.  
At the 2018 annual meeting, the Board submitted proposals to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to reduce the current supermajority vote thresholds to majority votes.  These proposals only received votes for approval from approximately 42% of the total outstanding shares, which were short of the 75% required approval threshold.  However, we received feedback from our shareholder engagement meetings that we should resubmit these proposals for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting, so the Board has included these proposals in this proxy statement.
Sustainability and Stewardship
In 2017, CRC consulted with its workforce, state and community leaders, sustainability professionals and labor and non-profit groups about ways to expand our annual HSE metrics and enhance our life-of-field planning process.  As a result of this dialogue, CRC adopted four 2030 Sustainability Goals – for water recycling, renewables, methane and carbon – in 2017 which advance California's 2030 goals and aid in our life-of-field planning process. CRC issued a Sustainability Report describing the goals that year, in addition to its annual water management summary.  The report noted that the Sustainability Goals are subject to liquidity, funding and permitting and are measured against a 2013 baseline, the year before CRC launched as an independent company and also a baseline year for certain state goals. 
In 2018, CRC adopted specific quantitative targets for the Sustainability Goals, and its 2018 Sustainability Report described those targets, the specific projects and teams assigned to each goal and the Company's progress toward meeting the goals.  CRC has committed to report annually on its progress, which is specifically tied to the review of individual performance of Company executives, since our executives have an ability to advance the successful attainment of the Sustainability Goals. The specific 2030 targets against a 2013 baseline and our progress through 2018 are detailed on our website Sustainability page (www.crc.com/sustainability) and the 2018 Sustainability Report which is hosted on the Sustainability page.  Our 2030 targets against a 2013 baseline are summarized below:
Water Goal -- Increase volume of recycled produced water by 30%.
Renewables Goal -- Integrate renewables into oil and gas operations by adding 10 MW from renewable sources.
Methane Goal -- Reduce methane emissions by 50%.

Carbon Goal -- Design and permit a carbon capture and sequestration system at Elk Hills by 2030 that would, if permitted, funded and installed, reduce GHG emissions by 30%.  
CRC's 2030 Sustainability Goals underscore the Company's commitment to serve as a responsible steward of California's natural resources and to advance California's long-term goals.  Importantly, by helping to increase local production of oil, natural gas and electricity, CRC also:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ➢  sustains careers for working Californians from diverse backgrounds, including union workers who build and maintain CRC's facilities; 
    ➢  generates government revenues that fund essential public services; 
    ➢  makes our energy supply more secure, affordable and reliable for Californians;  
    ➢  reduces reliance on energy imports from distant states and across the globe; and  
    ➢  strengthens our economy and society by making California more resilient and self-sufficient.

Audit Committee Report 
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of California Resources Corporation approves the appointment and services of the independent registered public accounting firm, and monitors (1) the integrity of the financial statements of CRC; (2) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance; (3) the effectiveness and performance of CRC's internal audit function; (4) CRC's system of disclosure controls and procedures, internal control structure over financial reporting and compliance with ethical standards; and (5) the compliance by CRC with legal and regulatory requirements related to financial statements.
The Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee satisfies the standards of independence established under the SEC's rules and regulations and listing standards of the NYSE. The Board of Directors has further determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is financially literate and that Mr. Gannon is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC.
In connection with our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee has:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements contained in CRC's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018; 
• discussed with CRC's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, the matters required to be discussed by applicable auditing standards; 
• received the written disclosures from KPMG LLP as required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; 
• discussed with KPMG LLP its independence from CRC and members of its management; 
• considered any non-audit services in assessing auditor independence;  
• had an executive session with KPMG LLP to provide them with the opportunity to discuss any other matters that they desired to raise without management present; and 
• had an executive session with Ryder Scott Company, CRC's independent reserves audit firm, to discuss the oil and gas reserves determination process and related public disclosures, and to provide them with the opportunity to discuss any other matters that they desired to raise without management present. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the review and discussions with CRC's management, independent registered public accounting firm and independent reserves audit firm, as set forth above, the Audit Committee recommended to CRC's Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

 (1)  We use a VCI metric for project selection and capital allocation across our portfolio of opportunities. We calculate VCI for each of our projects by dividing the net present value of the project's expected pre-tax cash flow over its life by the present value of the investments, each using a 10% discount rate.

Historical Perspective – Drivers of Strategic Priorities
CRC was spun off from Occidental Petroleum Corporation on November 30, 2014. Occidental burdened CRC with a substantial debt load of $6.3 billion, which peaked at $6.765 billion including the effect of the capital program being implemented by Oxy immediately prior to the spin-off, and implemented the spin-off just as a severe and extended downturn in commodity prices began.
Our highly leveraged balance sheet, resulting from decisions made by Occidental prior to the spin-off, has been a significant factor disproportionately affecting our stock price performance in a negative manner compared to our industry peers during the recent downturn. For perspective, despite achieving total shareholder returns that were the best of our peer group for 2018 and top quartile for the two-year period 2017-2018, CRC's equity market capitalization decreased almost 70%, from $2.8 billion at the spin-off to $0.8 billion at December 31, 2018.
To address stockholder concerns regarding CRC's leverage, our management team focused on the difficult task of reducing our debt in the low commodity price environment. Since the second quarter following the spin-off, when our debt level reached its peak, management has significantly reduced our debt without unduly increasing our interest costs or significantly diluting our equity. 
As a result of these priorities, CRC has had very limited capital available to invest and production has declined compared to CRC's peers who had greater access to capital because of their lower leverage.

The charts below outline the swift, decisive actions management has taken through the commodity downturn that have positioned CRC for growth as commodity prices recover, as well as the different mechanisms our management team employed to reduce CRC's outstanding debt. During this period our management team worked constructively with our bank lenders to negotiate eight amendments to our credit facility, including an amendment in 2018.

In summary, our stock price performance during the industry downturn has been disproportionately affected by the highly leveraged balance sheet that we inherited from Occidental. Our management team has made significant accomplishments in deleveraging the balance sheet and improving CRC's strategic position to take advantage of potential future commodity price increases.

Linkage Between Pay and Performance
Our compensation program is well designed to link the pay realized by our executives to the performance of CRC and the returns to our stockholders, while also providing retention incentives necessary to retain our executives through this challenging period. 
The pay mix at target grant date values for our chief executive officer and other named executive officers for 2018 was primarily long-term and performance-based.

Realizable Pay Analysis
The chart below illustrates the degree to which our CEO's realizable pay has been impacted by changes in the stock price after the grant date, illustrating the significant alignment of CRC's compensation program with shareholder returns.
Notes regarding the CEO Realizable Pay:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Realizable Pay is defined as: (i) base salary paid each year; (ii) actual annual incentive earned for the year; (iii) for option grants, the intrinsic ("in-the-money") value of each year's grant as of December 31, 2018; (iv) for restricted stock grants, the value of each year's grant based on the December 31, 2018 stock price; (v) for performance awards that have vested, the value of the award based on the actual payout percentage and the stock price at December 31, 2018; and (vi) for performance awards that have not vested, the target payout of the award based on the stock price as of December 31, 2018.  
• 2014 realizable Annual Incentive reflects payout at 105% of target. The Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion in the determination of the payout based on economic conditions at the time of the payout, reducing the payout from significantly above target to 105% of target. 
• 2014 realizable Long-Term Incentives were all stock-based and reflect 60% of the target long-term incentive value in the form of stock options that are significantly underwater with an exercise price of $81.10 compared to the stock price of $17.04 as of December 31, 2018. 
• 2015 Base Salary reflects the full year at the CRC Base Salary, which was not increased over the initial Base Salary at the time of the Spin-off. 
• 2015 realizable Annual Incentive reflects payout at 92% of target. The Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion in the determination of the payout based on economic conditions at the time of the payout, reducing the payout from above target to 92% of target.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2015 realizable Long-Term Incentives were all stock-based and reflect 20% of the target long-term incentive value in the form of stock options that are significantly underwater with an exercise price of $42.00 compared to the stock price of $17.04 as of December 31, 2018. The performance-based portion reflects actual payout at 116.55% of target. 
• 2016 realizable Base Salary reflects a 10% reduction from March 2016 to October 2016 implemented to conserve cash during the most severe period of the downturn in oil prices. 
• 2016 target Long-Term Incentives reflect a total grant date value that was 30% lower than the prior year to be consistent with anticipated changes in peer company grant values due to the sustained downturn in oil prices. 
• 2016 realizable Long-Term Incentives reflect the effect on the RSU portion (50% of the target value) of the increase in the stock price from the May 27, 2016 grant date ($15.40) to December 31, 2018 ($17.04). 
• 2017 realizable Long-Term Incentives reflect the effect on the RSU portion (50% of the target value) of the decrease in the stock price from the February 13, 2017 grant date ($18.81) to December 31, 2018 ($17.04). 
• 2018 realizable Long-Term Incentives reflect the effect of the decrease in the stock price from the February 21, 2018 grant date ($18.34) to December 31, 2018 ($17.04).

Stockholder Outreach
We regularly request meetings with several of our stockholders to discuss our governance and executive compensation practices. Overall, we received positive feedback on our corporate governance and compensation practices as part of our 2018 stockholder outreach initiative, in particular with regards to the changes we made to our compensation program in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT WE HEARD  WHAT WE DID 
 ✓   Stockholders would like to see greater proportion of executive compensation aligned with stockholders   ✓   Increased proportion of executive compensation that is equity-based and performance-based beginning in 2018 
 ✓   Stockholders would like to see greater proportion of annual incentive based on quantitative measures  ✓   Reduced qualitative strategic and individual portion of the annual incentive beginning in 2018 
 ✓   Stockholders would like to see more detailed disclosure regarding annual incentive payouts  ✓   Provided more detailed disclosure regarding payouts under the strategic and individual portion of our annual incentive beginning with the 2018 proxy statement 
[END TABLE]
We will continue to reach out to stockholders to solicit feedback to ensure that our governance and executive compensation practices align with stockholders' expectations.
Stockholder Approval of Executive Compensation
Our stockholder advisory vote in 2018 on the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2017, resulted in a 96.5% approval of such compensation. In adjusting our executive compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considered the results of last year's advisory vote on executive compensation and many other factors, including the Compensation Committee's assessment of the interaction of our compensation programs with our corporate business objectives, evaluations of our programs by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, feedback from our ongoing stockholder outreach initiative and review of data relating to pay practices of our compensation peer group.

Elements of Our Compensation Program
Compensation Philosophy
The following core principles form the foundation of our compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation programs should motivate our executives to take actions that are aligned with our short- and long-term strategic objectives, and appropriately balance risk versus potential reward. 
• A high percentage of senior executives' pay should be based on performance to ensure the highest level of accountability to stockholders. 
• Performance-based pay should offer an opportunity for above market compensation when our performance exceeds our goals balanced by the risk of below market compensation when it does not. 
• Our compensation programs should focus our executives on the long-term performance of the Company, thereby more closely aligning our executives' interests with those of our stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Program Best Practices
Our executive compensation program is well-designed, incorporates best practices and is governed by a highly engaged Compensation Committee. Our short-term and long-term incentive plans are primarily performance-based and are intended to align with the short- and long-term best interests of stockholders. The Compensation Committee has engaged in best practices to further align executive pay with Company performance and to ensure good governance in the following ways:
WHAT WE DO We pay for performance. A significant portion of the compensation of our named executive officers is directly linked to the Company's performance, by way of a compensation structure that includes performance-based annual and long-term incentive awards. We are stockholder-aligned. Annual and long-term incentive awards are based on performance measures that are aligned with the creation of value for our stockholders. A majority of the outstanding long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers are stock-based.  We have "double trigger" change in control provisions. Our change in control arrangements for named executive officers require both the occurrence of a change in control event and termination of employment before applicable vesting of awards occurs. We provide market-competitive compensation. Our compensation program is competitive within our industry and recognizes evolving governance practices, which allows us to attract and retain key talent. We have stock ownership requirements. We maintain stock ownership guidelines which require our named executive officers and directors to have meaningful stock ownership in the Company. We have a clawback policy. Our Compensation Recoupment and Clawback Policy allows the Company to require reimbursement of incentive compensation in certain circumstances. We seek independent advice. The Compensation Committee retains an independent advisor to review executive compensation and provide advice to the Compensation Committee. 
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION    34
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2019 PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Report 
 WE DON'T DO We do not have individual employment agreements. We do not have employment agreements with any of our named executive officers. We do not allow hedging or pledging. Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits certain transactions involving our stock, including hedging and pledging. We do not allow the repricing of stock options. Our equity incentive plan prohibits the repricing or backdating of stock options. We do not offer enhanced retirement benefits. Our nonqualified defined compensation plan provides restorative, but not enhanced, retirement benefits for executives. We do not encourage excessive risk or inappropriate risk taking through our incentive programs. Our plans do not motivate executives to engage in activities that create ssive or inappropriate risk for the Company.
Compensation Peer Group Selection
The Compensation Committee believes that the most relevant compensation peer companies are those that could compete for our talent with similar operating complexity and financial characteristics to CRC. The Compensation Committee reviews the peer companies each year based on the criteria below and adjusts as necessary to ensure alignment with those objectives.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Characteristic    Rationale   
   Characteristic    Rationale   
   Characteristic    Rationale   
 Enterprise Value• Indicator of size, situational factor and financial strategy• Due to our highly leveraged balance sheet, the Compensation Committee focused on Enterprise Value statistics 
 Asset Value• Indicator of size• Indicator of geographic footprint, business model, operational complexity and competition for talent• The Compensation Committee does not believe executives at smaller companies face comparable responsibilities and challenges 
 Asset Value• Indicator of size• Indicator of geographic footprint, business model, operational complexity and competition for talent• The Compensation Committee does not believe executives at smaller companies face comparable responsibilities and challenges 
[END TABLE]
Peer company selection based on equity market capitalization would generally result in companies that are much smaller in complexity and scope of operations than CRC due to our highly leveraged balance sheet and resulting depressed equity market capitalization. The Compensation Committee does not believe that companies with similar equity market capitalizations represent the competitive market for our executive team's skills and experience and accordingly believes that setting CRC compensation levels consistent with these smaller companies would penalize our management team for factors beyond their control, causing substantial retention problems.

2018 Compensation Program
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee made 2018 compensation program design decisions focused on paying for performance, motivating and retaining the current management team and managing the remaining shares available for grants with the continued low stock price.   
Compensation Program Changes Made for 2018
The Compensation Committee considered feedback received through stockholder outreach and made the following changes to the compensation program for 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reduced the strategic and individual objective portion of the annual incentive from 40% to 20% 
• Increased the portion of compensation that is performance-based by granting premium-priced stock options in place of 20% of the long-term incentive that was time-vested restricted stock, resulting in 60% of the long-term incentive value granted as performance-based awards 
• Changed the long-term performance-based award to be equity-based

   Performance Measure  Description 
   Performance Measure  Description 
 Value Creation Index  VCI is calculated at year end as the discounted expected future revenue (using SEC pricing) from production of reserves added during 2018 net of production operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, but before any general and administrative charges and income taxes, divided by the discounted capital invested for 2018, each using a 10% discount rate.  The Compensation Committee decided to change the pricing assumptions from 5-year Brent strip, held stable after 5 years, due to the extreme volatility of Brent pricing at year end. The SEC pricing has been less volatile, is consistent with reserve reporting requirements and better reflects the conditions under which management makes its investment decisions that result in the VCI achieved. 
 Production  Total production in thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boep/d) 
 Production Costs  Absolute production cost (millions) 
 HSE – Combined IIR  Injury and illness incidence rate of employees and contractors 
 HSE – Spill Prevention Rate  (Boe produced minus net reportable oil spill volume) divided by Boe produced  
 HSE – Net water supplied to Ag  Volume of water supplied to agriculture divided by volume of fresh water purchased 
 EBITDAX  Adjusted EBITDAX (millions) excluding EBITDAX attributable to the BSP JV ($70 million).  See Annex A for CRC's calculation of adjusted EBITDAX. 
 Debt  Face value of outstanding debt less available cash (billions)

   Execution of strategic plan and initiatives                                       Debt Management      Executed a large midstream joint venture which provided funding for the purchase of Chevron's interest in the former Elk Hills unit, providing greater flexibility at our flagship asset to be able to create value and continue to drive down costs.   Executed upstream joint ventures that made an immediate impact, helping CRC manage cash flow and add value through proving up additional inventory and de-risking existing inventory.   Restructured the organization around focus on VCI and management of cash margins, pushing ownership, decision making and responsibility down in the organization with a focus on allocating human capital to the most valuable projects and managing field level operating costs and G&A.   Maintained focus on controllable costs as activity ramped up through the year and then tempered at year-end due to extreme oil price volatility.    Continued execution of opportunistic hedging strategy targeting 50% of oil production, underpinning cash flows and maximizing liquidity, resulting in a net derivative gain for 2018.   Obtained reaffirmation of the borrowing base under our credit agreements while removing assets from the borrowing base, creating greater flexibility for debt repurchases.

Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee assessed the CEO's performance against his Strategic and Individual objectives to be above target, but decided to limit his individual component result to approximately target due to CRC's negative shareholder return for the year.  The CEO's assessments of the other NEOs against  their respective Strategic and Individual objectives were also above target, but were similarly limited, other than Mr. Kerns. The Compensation Committee approved the following 2018 annual incentive payouts:

2018 Restricted Stock Unit Award – The 2018 Restricted Stock Unit Award (RSU Award) is a stock-based, stock- and cash- settled long-term incentive award intended to primarily promote retention and enhance alignment with stockholder interests through development of ownership in the Company with time-vested payouts, with one-third of the units vesting at the end of each year during the three-year period commencing at the grant date. The RSU Award will be settled 60% in shares and 40% in cash with required tax withholding taken first from the cash portion of the payout, in order to manage the remaining shares available for awards under the LTIP.
2018 Performance Stock Unit Award – The 2018 Performance Stock Unit Award (PSU Award) is a stock-based, stock- and cash-settled long-term performance award with performance measures based 50% on CRC's unit costs per Boe relative to industry peers with similar cost structures and 50% on VCI, both measured over a three-year period. For payouts up to the target number of units, the PSU Award will be settled 60% in stock and 40% in cash. For payouts greater than the target number of units, the payout of units in excess of target will be settled in cash. Required tax withholding on payouts will be taken first from the cash portion of the payout, in order to manage the remaining shares available for awards under the LTIP.
The performance measures for the 2018 PSU Award continued to focus the management team on making decisions that will enhance shareholder value over the long term. Utilization of the VCI measure drives our capital allocation decisions to ensure that we focus spending on the highest return projects over the long term as compared to our annual incentive VCI measure that rewards spending decisions for the one-year period. The relative cost performance metrics ensure that management continues to control costs and maximize our margins over the long term relative to our peers. These factors are within management's control.
The peer companies chosen for the relative unit cost performance measures under these awards were selected based upon companies with similar asset and operating cost characteristics to CRC, rather than similar size to CRC as used for compensation benchmarking purposes. The peer companies selected by the Compensation Committee for the 2018 PSU Award are: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, BP p.l.c., Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy Inc., Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Denbury Resources Inc., Exxon Mobil Corporation, Hess Corporation, Husky Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Limited, Marathon Oil Company, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell plc, and Suncor Energy Inc. This peer group was not used for compensation benchmarking purposes.

2018 Stock Options – The Compensation Committee granted stock options as part of the 2018 long-term incentive awards to further align executives with stockholders. The 2018 stock options were premium-priced, granted with an exercise price that was 10% above stock price on the grant date. The options will vest one-third at the end of each year during the three-year period commencing on the grant date and remain exercisable until the end of the seventh year following the grant date.
The Compensation Committee reviewed the long-term incentive grant date target values of the NEOs to determine if they remained appropriately positioned against the peer group compensation data and internally aligned. The Compensation Committee adjusted the long-term incentive grant date values for the CEO and some of the other NEOs based on such factors as the individual's performance, increased job responsibility and position relative to peer group compensation data.

Compensation Committee Report 
2019 Annual Incentive Design
The annual incentive component of our 2019 compensation program was designed to promote the achievement of financial, operating and strategic results that are aligned with creation of stockholder value. Based on feedback from stockholders to reduce the qualitative portion of the award, the performance measures are comprised of quantitative financial and operational measures for 80% of the target annual incentive and qualitative individual objective measures for 20% of the target annual incentive. 
Aligning performance criteria with our strategic areas of focus for the year, the Compensation Committee approved performance measures designed to encourage decision making that will enhance stockholder value creation. The Compensation Committee approved performance criteria based on expected results under CRC's business plan at the time they were established in February 2019. Target performance criteria were set at levels that would represent successful execution of the 2019 business plan, and maximum performance criteria were set at levels that would represent significant outperformance against the 2019 business plan.

2019 Restricted Stock Unit Award – The 2019 Restricted Stock Unit Award (RSU Award) is a stock-based, stock- and cash- settled long-term incentive award intended to primarily promote retention and enhance alignment with stockholder interests through development of ownership in the Company with time-vested payouts, with one-third of the units vesting at the end of each year during the three-year period commencing at the grant date. The RSU Award will be settled 50% in shares and 50% in cash with required tax withholding taken first from the cash portion of the payout.
2019 Performance Stock Unit Award – The 2019 Performance Stock Unit Award (PSU Award) is a stock-based, stock- and cash-settled long-term performance award with performance measures based 50% on relative total shareholder return and 50% on VCI, both measured over a three-year period. For payouts up to the target number of units, the PSU Award will be settled 50% in stock and 50% in cash. For payouts greater than the target number of units, the payout of units in excess of target will be settled in cash. Required tax withholding on payouts will be taken first from the cash portion of the payouts.
The performance measures for the 2019 PSU Award continue to focus the management team on making decisions that will enhance stockholder value over the long term. Utilization of the VCI measure drives our capital allocation decisions to ensure that we focus spending on the highest return projects over the long term as compared to our annual incentive VCI measure that rewards spending decisions for the one-year period. The relative total shareholder return measure directly ties compensation to shareholder returns.
The peer companies chosen for the relative unit cost performance measures under these awards are the same as those selected by the Compensation Committee for the 2018 PSU Award as shown on page 47.
The PSU Award will vest at the end of three years from the grant date based on achieved performance against pre-determined performance criteria. 
2019 Stock Options – The Compensation Committee granted stock options as part of the 2019 long-term incentive awards to further align executives with stockholders. The 2019 stock options were granted with an exercise price that was 10% above stock price on the grant date. The options will vest one-third at the end of each year during the three-year period commencing on the grant date and remain exercisable until the end of the seventh year following the grant date.

Compensation Committee Report 
Our Executive Compensation Process
Role of Compensation Committee
Our executive compensation program is overseen by our Compensation Committee, with input from our management and outside compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"). In its oversight role, the committee is responsible for making compensation decisions involving our CEO and other executive officers and evaluating performance for compensatory purposes.
Role of Management 
Our CEO, Chairman and Vice President of Compensation and Benefits provided input to the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation, key job responsibilities, achievement of performance objectives and compensation program design. We believe these individuals provide helpful support to the Compensation Committee in these areas given their understanding of our business and personnel, compensation programs and competitive environment. The Compensation Committee is not obligated to accept management's recommendations with respect to executive compensation matters, and meets in executive session to discuss such matters outside of the presence of our management. During 2018, the Compensation Committee held two executive sessions. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee retained Meridian as its independent compensation consultant in January 2015, after considering all factors relevant to Meridian's independence from our management and members of our Compensation Committee and determining that it was independent and without conflicts of interest under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and the NYSE Listed Company Manual standards.
In 2018, the compensation consultant was responsible for reviewing our executive compensation program, assisting in the design of our annual and long-term incentive programs and providing comparative market data and trends on compensation practices and programs based on an analysis of our peer companies and other factors. Representatives of the compensation consultant participated in all meetings of the committee during 2018, including executive sessions without management. The compensation consultant provided no other services to CRC.
Use of Compensation Data
Over the course of the year, our Compensation Committee analyzed the comparative total compensation of our executive officers. To facilitate this analysis, the compensation consultant provided the committee with comparative compensation data that included base salaries, annual incentive opportunities, and long-term incentive opportunities. This information reflected recent publicly available information and other market data. We believe that it provided our Compensation Committee with a sufficient basis to analyze the comparative total compensation of our executive officers. 
Other Compensation and Benefits
In addition to the components of the executive compensation program described above, we provide the following programs to our named executive officers.
Qualified Defined Contribution Plan–All of our employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to participate in a tax-qualified, defined contribution plan. The defined contribution plan provides for periodic cash contributions by us based on annual cash compensation and employee deferrals. Employees are permitted to contribute into the plan a percentage of their annual salary and bonus up to the annual limit set by IRS regulations. Employees are able to direct their account balances to a variety of investments.

Compensation Committee Report 
Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plans–Substantially all employees, including our named executive officers, whose participation in our qualified defined contribution plan is limited by applicable tax laws are eligible to participate in our supplemental savings plan (the "SSP"), a nonqualified defined contribution plan, which provides additional retirement benefits outside of those limitations.
Annual allocations for each participant are generally intended to restore the amounts that would have been contributed to our qualified defined contribution plan but for certain tax law limitations, and certain employer allocations are subject to a vesting schedule that requires the completion of three years of service. Vested account balances will be payable following separation from service.
Interest on SSP account balances is allocated monthly to each participant's account based on the yield on five-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturities plus 2% converted to a monthly allocation factor.
In addition, we sponsor a supplemental retirement plan (the "SRP II"), which was established for purposes of the assumption by us of certain liabilities under the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan II, including those for all of our named executive officers. All account balances under the SRP II are fully vested at all times and are credited with interest on a monthly basis based on the yield on five-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturities plus 2% converted to a monthly allocation factor. No additional allocations are made under the SRP II other than the crediting of interest.
In order to provide greater financial planning flexibility to participants while not increasing costs under the plan, the SRP II allows in-service distribution of a participant's account at a specified age, but not earlier than age 60, as elected by the participant when initially participating in the plan. After a participant receives a specified age distribution, future allocations under the SRP II and earnings on those allocations are to be distributed in the first 70 days of each following year.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan–Certain management and other highly compensated employees (including each of our named executive officers) are eligible to participate in our nonqualified deferred compensation plan (the "DCP"). Under the DCP, participants are able to elect to defer a portion of their base salary and annual bonus for a given year. Each year, we will allocate an additional amount to a DCP participant's account equal to the sum of 7% (which is immediately vested) and 12% (which is subject to a vesting schedule that requires the completion of three years of service) of the compensation deferred by the participant under the DCP to restore amounts that are not contributed to the qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans due to such deferral of compensation under the DCP. Deferred amounts will earn interest based on the yield on five-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturities based on a monthly frequency plus 2%, converted to a monthly allocation factor. Vested account balances will be payable following separation from service, or upon attainment of a specified age elected by the participant.
Tax Preparation and Financial Planning–Our executives, including each of the named executive officers, are eligible to receive reimbursement, up to certain annual limits, for income tax preparation, financial planning and investment advice, including legal advice related to tax and financial matters.
Insurance–We offer a variety of health coverage options to all employees. Named executive officers participate in these plans on the same terms as other employees. In addition, for executives, including the named executive officers, we pay for an annual comprehensive physical examination. We provide all employees with life insurance equal to twice the employee's base salary. We also provide executives, including the named executive officers, with excess liability insurance coverage.
Severance Benefits–We maintain a notice and severance pay plan that, in connection with a qualifying termination of employment, provides for up to 12 months of base salary and other insurance coverage, depending on years of service, for non-bargained employees, including the named executive officers.

Compensation Committee Report 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan–We adopted the California Resources Corporation 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), effective January 1, 2015, which provides our employees (including our named executive officers) the ability to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the closing price of a share of our common stock as of the first day of each offering period or the last day of each offering period, whichever amount is less.
The maximum number of shares of our common stock which may be issued pursuant to the ESPP is 1.5 million, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the ESPP. In addition, participants in the ESPP are subject to certain limits on the number of shares that can be purchased in any given year and during any given offering period (a calendar quarter) under the ESPP.
Corporate Aircraft Use–Executives and directors may use the Company's fractional interest in aircraft for personal travel, if space is available. The named executive officers and directors reimburse CRC for personal use of the Company's fractional interest in aircraft, including any guests accompanying them, at not less than the standard industry fare level rate (which is determined in accordance with IRS regulations), or income is imputed and the executive or director is reimbursed for related taxes.
Conversion of Occidental Long-Term Incentive Awards in Connection with Spin-off in 2014
Each long-term incentive award with respect to Occidental common stock that was held by our named executive officers was converted upon the Spin-off into an award of shares of CRC's restricted common stock (an "RSA"), with the number of shares determined based upon the trading price of Occidental's common stock preceding the Spin-off and our common stock following the Spin-off. Performance-based awards were converted based on target performance payout for awards with more than one year remaining in the performance period, or at actual performance payout (as determined by the Occidental Compensation Committee) for awards with less than one year remaining in the performance period. The converted RSAs are subject to time-based vesting requirements the same as the time-based vesting requirements that were applicable to the corresponding Occidental award and performance-based vesting requirements established by the CRC Compensation Committee.
The RSAs held by our named executive officers were performance-based awards with payouts that were dependent on the outcome of the performance criteria and the price of our stock on the award certification date, as applicable, with the possibility of no payout if the performance criteria were not met. These were long-term awards with two-year and three- to seven-year performance periods, as applicable, that, based on achievement of performance criteria, vested in their entirety by the end of 2018. 
Key Compensation Policies and Practices
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We have minimum stock ownership guidelines for senior executives. The target direct and indirect ownership level for the Chief Executive Officer is six times annual base salary, and for the other named executive officers, is three times annual base salary. Executives have five years to attain their required ownership levels. Since the Spin-off occurred on November 30, 2014, the named executive officers have until November 30, 2019 or later to meet the target ownership levels.
Clawback Policy
Under the Company's Compensation Recoupment and Clawback Policy, in the event the Company is required to restate its financial statements, the Company has the right to require in certain circumstances, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the reimbursement of incentive compensation by a named executive officer whose fraud or misconduct either caused or contributed to the need for such restatement. Such incentive compensation generally includes any cash, equity, equity-based or other award under the LTIP, or an annual bonus or annual incentive plan of the Company.

Compensation Committee Report 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy
Under the Company's Insider Trading Policy, all directors, officers and employees, including the named executive officers, are prohibited from hedging, buying or selling options, engaging in short sales, or trading prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, exchange funds, forward-sale contracts, collars or other derivatives or monetizations on Company securities. In addition, all directors, officers and employees, including named executive officers, may not pledge or mortgage Company securities as collateral for a loan, or hold Company securities in a margin account.
Compensation Risk Management
Our compensation programs are designed to motivate and reward our employees for their performance during the current year and over the long term, and for taking appropriate business risks to enhance CRC's business performance. The Compensation Committee has analyzed CRC's employee compensation programs and policies and believes that they are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on CRC. CRC's compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and any potential risk that the executive compensation program could influence behavior that would be inconsistent with the overall interests of CRC and its stockholders is mitigated by several factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target compensation mix utilizes a balance of salary, annual incentives and long-term equity compensation vesting over three years 
• Transparent financial and operational metrics that are readily ascertainable from publicly-filed information 
• External performance metrics, such as relative costs per Boe, for a portion of the long-term performance-based incentive awards 
• Forfeiture and clawback provisions for incentive award compensation in the event of a restatement of our financial statements or violation of CRC's Code of Business Ethics 
[END TABLE]
Tax Considerations
Together with the Compensation Committee, the Company carefully reviews and takes into account current tax law and regulations as they relate to the design of our compensation programs and related decisions.  Prior to the enactment of tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, which was originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"), Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), limited a company's ability to deduct compensation paid in excess of $1 million during any fiscal year to each of certain NEOs, unless the compensation was performance-based as defined under federal tax laws. Subject to certain transitional rules, the TCJA has repealed the exemption for performance-based compensation from the deduction limitation of Section 162(m) of the Code for taxable years beginning after 2017. The Compensation Committee historically reviewed and considered the deductibility of our executive compensation programs; and provided compensation that was not fully deductible when necessary to retain and motivate certain executive officers and when it was in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. To the extent compensatory awards are not covered by the transitional rules, the performance-based compensation exception to the deduction limitation under Section 162(m) of the Code will no longer be available to the Company and annual compensation paid to certain executives in excess of $1 million will not be deductible.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO) was $145,578.  
• The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 57, was $7,734,657. 
• Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was reasonably estimated to be 53 to 1. 
[END TABLE]
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that, as of December 31, 2018 (which is the date we chose to identify our median employee), our employee population consisted of approximately 1,500 individuals with all of these individuals located in the United States (as reported in Item 1, Business, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2019 (our "Annual Report")). This population consisted of our full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, as we do not have seasonal workers.  
• We used the total compensation reflected in our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2018 as a consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to the W-2 wages, and we did not annualize the compensation for any employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We believe the use of W-2 wages, as applicable, is the most appropriate compensation measure since it includes the total taxable compensation received by our employees in 2018.  
• We identified our median employee by consistently applying this compensation measure to all of our employees included in our analysis. Since all of our employees, including our CEO, are located in the United States, we did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee.  
• After we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for the 2018 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $145,578.  
• With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included on page 57 and incorporated by reference under Item 11 of Part III of our Annual Report.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Summary
Payments and other benefits payable to named executive officers in various termination circumstances and a change in control are subject to certain policies, plans and agreements. Following is a summary of the material terms of these arrangements.
Under our Notice and Severance Pay Plan, employees terminated due to job elimination or relocation who are not offered continued employment by CRC are eligible for up to 12 months of base salary depending on years of service, two months of contributions pursuant to CRC's qualified and nonqualified savings plans with immediate vesting of any unvested balances, and continued medical and dental coverage for the applicable notice and severance period at the active employee rate. 
Our Long-Term Incentive Awards have provisions that, in the event of a change in control with a termination in connection with the change in control, provide for the outstanding awards granted under such plan to become fully vested and exercisable unless the plan administrator determines, prior to the occurrence of the event, that benefits will not accelerate. 
Except as described in this summary and below under "Potential Payments," we do not have any other agreements or plans that would have required us to provide compensation to our named executive officers in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control.
Potential Payments
In the discussion that follows, payments and other benefits payable upon various terminations and change in control situations are set out as if the conditions for payments had occurred and the terminations took place on December 31, 2018, and reflect the terms of applicable plans and long-term incentive award agreements then in effect. None of our NEOs have employment agreements. The amounts set forth below are estimates of the amounts that would have been paid to each named executive officer upon his termination. The actual amounts to be paid out can be determined only at the time of separation. The disclosures below do not take into consideration any requirements under Section 409A of the Code, which could affect, among other things, the timing of payments and distributions.
The following payments and benefits, which are potentially available on a non-discriminatory basis to all full-time salaried employees when their employment terminates, are not included in the amounts shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Notice and Severance Pay Plan payments and benefits, payable if the employee's job is either eliminated or relocated and the employee is not offered continued employment. 
• Life insurance proceeds equal to two times base salary, payable on death as available to all eligible employees. 
• Amounts vested under our plans that are qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
• Amounts vested under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation arrangements. 
• Payout of unused accrued vacation.

 (1)  The annual incentive award provides for a pro rata payout in the event of death or disability at any time during the year and in the event of retirement with consent or termination without cause after June 30, 2018. Amount shown is the annual incentive award that would have been payable, based on the amounts that were approved by the Compensation Committee as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table.  
 (2)  In the event of retirement with consent, termination without cause, death or disability, a pro rata portion of the RSU awards would be forfeited. In the event of death or disability, the remainder would become payable immediately. In the event of change in control with termination as a result of the change in control, the full awards would be payable immediately. Amounts shown represent the product of the number of shares/units that become vested upon occurrence of the indicated event and $17.04, the closing price of CRC common stock on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year.  
 (3)  In the event of retirement with consent or termination without cause, a pro rata portion of the PSU Awards would be forfeited and the remainder would remain subject to the performance criteria through the award certification date. In the event of death or disability, a pro rata portion of the target award would become payable immediately. In the event of change in control with termination as a result of the change in control, the award, adjusted for actual performance through the event date, would be payable immediately. Amounts shown reflect target payout and represent the product of the number of units that would have become vested upon occurrence of the indicated event and $17.04, the closing price of CRC common stock on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year.  
 (4)  In the event of retirement with consent or termination without cause, a pro rata portion of the PIA target incentive amount would be forfeited and the remainder would remain subject to the performance criteria through the award certification date. In the event of death or disability, a pro rata portion of the target incentive amount would become payable immediately. In the event of change in control with termination as a result of the change in control, the target incentive amount, adjusted for actual performance through the event date, would be payable immediately. Amounts shown reflect target payout. 
 (5)  Under the terms of the option awards, options become (i) vested fully or prorated based upon the earlier of the executive's termination of employment for retirement, disability, death, or involuntary termination or (ii) fully vested upon termination of employment as a result of a change in control. Option award values are $0 because in each case the option exercise price was greater than $17.04, the price of CRC common stock on December 31, 2018.

 Director Compensation
Director Compensation
Program Objectives
Our director compensation program is designed to be consistent with the programs of our peer companies. The following matters were considered important to development of our director compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market practices of our peer companies targeting a compensation package that is at or below the median of this group. 
• The need to recruit and retain independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
Program Elements
For 2018, the cash retainer was reduced and equity award was increased, as described below, to more closely align with the median of our peer companies, while providing a greater portion of the director compensation in shares. The elements of our 2018 outside director compensation program were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual cash board retainer of $90,000, paid in equal monthly installments, reduced from $100,000 in prior years.  
• An additional annual cash retainer of $100,000 for our Chairman. 
• An additional annual cash retainer of $25,000 for the Lead Independent Director. 
• An additional annual cash retainer of $20,000 for the audit and compensation committee chairpersons and $15,000 for the other committee chairpersons. 
• An annual equity award relating to our common stock equivalent to $175,000 on the grant date, which generally vests one year following the grant date, increased from $150,000 in prior years.  
• A stock ownership guideline of five times the annual cash board retainer applies to outside directors and must be attained within five years of election to our Board of Directors. Since the Spin-off occurred on November 30, 2014, the outside directors have until November 30, 2019 or later to meet the target ownership levels.

The number of units granted was calculated based on the target value of the grant divided by the closing price of CRC common stock on the date of the grant, resulting in grants of 5,294 units and 3,485 units, respectively. Additional detail regarding assumptions underlying these share-based awards is included in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in CRC's 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The RSU awards will vest at the end of one year from the grant date or, if earlier, upon the occurrence of a change in control or the outside director's termination of service by reason of death or disability. As of December 31, 2018, each of the outside directors, except for Ms. Siegel, held 5,294 restricted stock units which will vest on May 10, 2019. Mr. Albrecht also held 127,678 stock options. Ms. Siegel held 3,485 restricted stock units which will vest on October 30, 2019. 
 (2)  Amount shown is the portion of interest credited in 2018 on nonqualified deferred compensation balances that was in excess of 120% of the long-term applicable federal rate, compounded monthly, as prescribed under Section 1274(d) of the Code.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and related regulations require our Section 16 officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Section 16 officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are also required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on our review of copies of such forms we received, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our Section 16 officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners timely complied with all applicable filing requirements of Section 16(a).

Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires us to provide our stockholders with an advisory (nonbinding) vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers (sometimes referred to as the "say-on-pay" proposal) as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, accompanying compensation tables and narrative discussion set forth in this proxy statement. Accordingly, you may vote on the following resolution at our Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, accompanying compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved."
This vote is nonbinding. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions to the extent they can determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results.

As described above in detail under the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talented executives and also to motivate our executives to achieve our designated goals and thereby create a successful company enhancing shareholder value. This advisory, nonbinding say-on-pay vote does not cover director compensation, which is also disclosed in the accompanying compensation tables.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR" PROPOSAL 3 ON THE ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE 
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION.
Proposal 4: Approval of the Amended and Restated California Resources Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan 
The Board of Directors believes that long-term incentive awards are a critical component of our compensation programs to be able to attract, retain and incentivize our employees, executives, and non-employee directors and to align their interests with those of stockholders through increased stock ownership. Our compensation program emphasizes performance-based long-term incentive awards to promote executive and employee behaviors that drive value creation that leads to long-term growth in shareholder value. The Board of Directors has determined that the current number of shares available for grants under the existing California Resources Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Existing LTIP") is not sufficient to meet the objectives of our compensation program going forward. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has adopted and proposes that the stockholders approve an amendment and restatement of the plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for grant by 2,575,000 and to make other changes to the plan as described below. 
Background and Purpose
Pursuant to the terms of the Existing LTIP, stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus stock, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards, cash awards and similar securities with a value derived from the value of our common stock or other Company securities may be awarded to officers, employees, consultants and directors selected for participation. 
The Existing LTIP authorizes awards to be granted covering up to 4,700,000 shares of our common stock, as adjusted to reflect the 1:10 reverse split that occurred on May 31, 2016, and subject to further adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Existing LTIP upon certain changes in capitalization and similar events. As of February 28, 2019, there were approximately 22,922 shares of common stock available for new awards under the Existing LTIP. 
On February 19, 2019, the Board of Directors determined that it is in the best interest of CRC to amend and restate the Existing LTIP (the "Amended LTIP"), subject to stockholder approval, to implement the following primary revisions: (i) increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 7,275,000; (ii) prohibit the award of dividend equivalents in connection with stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other non-full value appreciation awards; (iii) provide that dividends on restricted stock and any dividend equivalents on other full-value awards will be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying award with respect to which the dividend or dividend equivalent relates; (iv) eliminate certain provisions that were included in the Existing LTIP for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), but which are no longer needed following the amendment of Section 162(m) of the Code in 2017; and (v) extend the term of the plan to 10 years from the date of approval by stockholders. The proposed increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is expected to provide flexibility to enable the continued use of the Amended LTIP for stock-based grants and awards consistent with the objectives of our compensation program for three or more years while attempting to minimize dilution to stockholders.

For additional information regarding stock-based awards previously granted, please see Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements disclosed in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of February 28, 2019, there were 48,799,261 shares of our common stock outstanding. The closing price per share of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange as of March 11, 2019 was $21.26.
The effective date of the Amended LTIP will be the date of the Annual Meeting if the plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company on such date. If the proposed Amended LTIP is not so approved by our stockholders, then the Existing LTIP will remain in effect in its present form.
Summary of Features of the Amended LTIP
The following is a summary of the principal features of the Amended LTIP and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended LTIP, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex B. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined below have the meanings ascribed to them in the Amended LTIP.
Administration
Our Amended LTIP is administered by a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee" for purposes of this Proposal), which is and will be composed of at least two of our independent directors. Subject to the provisions of the Amended LTIP, the Compensation Committee has the authority to select the participants who will receive the grants and awards, to determine the type and terms of the grants and awards, and to interpret and administer the Amended LTIP. The Compensation Committee may delegate to our CEO the authority with respect to grants of awards to any eligible person who is not then subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations.
Shares Available for Grant or Award; Award Limits
The total number of shares of common stock authorized for grant or award under the Existing LTIP is 4,700,000. As of February 28, 2019, the number of shares of common stock available for future grants or awards was approximately 22,922.
The Amended LTIP will increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for awards under the plan by 2,575,000 shares, bringing the aggregate maximum number of shares of common stock authorized for grants or awards to 7,275,000.
Under the Amended LTIP, no more than 7,275,000 shares of common stock may be issued after October 6, 2014 (the original effective date of the Existing LTIP), pursuant to incentive options (which amount is included within the aggregate limit described in the preceding paragraph). The maximum number of shares of common stock for which options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted to any one person during any calendar year is 1,000,000. No individual may be granted other awards under the Amended LTIP (other than options and SARs) during any calendar year that are denominated in shares of common stock with respect to more than 1,000,000 shares. In addition, the maximum amount of compensation that may be paid under all 
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION    71

  2019 PROXY STATEMENT

 Proposals Requiring Your Vote 
Performance-Based Awards that are not denominated in shares of common stock (including the Fair Market Value of any shares of common stock paid in satisfaction of such Performance-Based Awards) granted to any one individual during any calendar year may not exceed $20,000,000 (and any payment due with respect to such a Performance-Based Award shall be paid no later than 10 years after the date of grant of such Performance-Based Award).
Shares of common stock covered by an award that expire or are forfeited, cancelled, or for any reason are terminated or fail to vest will be available for subsequent awards under the Amended LTIP. Shares covered by an option or SAR that expires or terminates prior to exercise and shares of restricted stock returned to us upon forfeiture will be available for subsequent awards. Shares of common stock tendered or withheld to satisfy an exercise price or tax withholding obligation for an award and shares of common stock we repurchase using option proceeds will not again be available for issuance under the Amended LTIP. Shares subject to options or SARs that are exercised will not again be available for issuance under the plan.
In addition to the limits described above, the Amended LTIP includes a limit on the awards that can be made under the plan to each non-employee director. Under the Amended LTIP, the aggregate grant date fair value (computed as of the date of grant in accordance with applicable financial accounting rules) of all awards granted under the plan to any individual, non-employee director during any single calendar year cannot exceed $750,000, determined without regard to grants of awards made under the plan to a non-employee director during any period in which such individual was employee or contractor.
Eligibility
Our officers, employees and consultants, as well as our non-employee directors, are eligible to receive awards in the Amended LTIP. As of February 28, 2019, we had 8 executive officers, approximately 1,500 other current employees, approximately 25 consultants and 9 non-employee directors who were eligible to participate in the Amended LTIP.
Types of Awards
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
An option is the right to purchase shares of common stock at a future date at a specified price. The Amended LTIP provides for two types of options: incentive options and nonstatutory options. An SAR is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise of the SAR over the base price of the SAR. Each option and SAR will have the term, and will be exercisable in whole or in such installments and at such times as, specified by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, but in no event will an option or SAR be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant.
Subject to the special limitations on incentive options described below, the option price per share of common stock subject to an option and the base price of any SAR will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, but, subject to certain adjustments, such option price and  base price will not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant of such award.
No options, SARs or other non-full value appreciation awards granted under the Amended LTIP may vest less than one year from the date of grant; provided, however, that up to 5% of the available shares under the Amended LTIP as of the date it is approved by our stockholders may be subject to options, SARs or other non-full value appreciation awards that vest (in full or in part) in less than one year from their date of grant. In addition, any option SAR or other non-full value appreciation award granted under the Amended LTIP may vest in full or in part upon death or disability of the participant, or upon a change in control, and such vesting will not count against the 5% exception described in the preceding sentence.
No incentive option may be granted to an individual if, at the time the option is granted, such individual owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its parent or any subsidiary corporation unless (a) at the time such option is granted the option price is at least 110% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and (b) such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant.

 Proposals Requiring Your Vote 
To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time each relevant incentive option is granted) of common stock subject to incentive options are exercisable for the first time by an employee during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations exceeds $100,000, such incentive options will be treated as nonstatutory options. The Compensation Committee will determine, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations and other administrative pronouncements, which of a participant's incentive options will no longer constitute incentive options because of such limitation and will notify the participant of such determination as soon as practicable after such determination.
Restricted Stock Awards
Typically, a restricted stock award is an award of a fixed number of shares of common stock subject to certain restrictions and other terms and conditions. A restricted stock award will be subject to restrictions on disposition by a participant and may include an obligation of the participant to forfeit and surrender the shares to the Company under certain circumstances (the "Restrictions"). The Restrictions will be determined by the Compensation Committee, and each restricted stock award may have different Restrictions. The Compensation Committee may provide that the Restrictions will lapse upon (a) the attainment of one or more performance measures, (b) the participant's continued employment with the Company or continued service as a consultant or director for a specified period of time, (c) the occurrence of any event or the satisfaction of any other condition specified by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion or (d) a combination of any of the foregoing. The Compensation Committee will determine the amount and form of any payment for common stock received pursuant to a restricted stock award, provided that in the absence of such a determination, a participant will not be required to make any payment for common stock received pursuant to a restricted stock award, except to the extent otherwise required by law.
Stock Bonuses
The Compensation Committee may grant a stock bonus to any eligible person to reward exceptional or special services, contributions or achievements in the manner and on such terms and conditions (including any restrictions on such shares) as determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares so awarded will be determined by the Compensation Committee and may be granted independently or in lieu of a cash bonus.
Stock Units
Stock units (or phantom share units) are not actual shares of common stock but, rather, represent a right to receive shares of common stock (or the value thereof) upon the satisfaction of certain specified terms and conditions. Stock units are generally credited to a recordkeeping account, and the value of a stock unit is typically based upon the value of an actual share of common stock.
Dividend Rights or Equivalents
Dividend rights or equivalents are amounts payable in cash or shares of common stock (or additional stock units that may be paid in shares of common stock or cash) equal to the amount of dividends that would have been paid on shares had the shares been outstanding from the date the stock-based award was granted.
No dividend equivalents will be granted in connection with stock options, stock appreciation rights or other non-full value appreciation awards granted under the Amended LTIP from and after it becomes effective.  In addition, the Amended LTIP provides that dividends on restricted stock and any dividend equivalents on other full-value awards granted from and after the Amended LTIP becomes effective will be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying award with respect to which the dividend or dividend equivalent relates.

Other Awards
Subject to the terms of the Amended LTIP and applicable legal requirements, the Compensation Committee may grant other awards that are valued, denominated, paid or otherwise based on or related to common stock. The Compensation Committee will determine all of the terms and conditions of all such awards, including, without limitation, method of delivery, consideration to be paid, the timing and methods of payment, and any performance criteria associated with an award. Cash awards may also be granted as separate awards, or as supplements to any other awards under the Amended LTIP. 
Performance-Based Awards
A "Performance-Based Award" is an award whose grant, vesting, exercisability or payment depends upon the satisfaction of any one or more "Performance Goals." Performance-Based Awards may be stock-based (payable in common stock only or in cash or common stock) or may be cash-only awards. A Performance-Based Award also includes an option or SAR granted with an exercise or base price not less than fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The performance period applicable to a Performance-Based Award may be up to 10 years.
Performance Goals are established by the Compensation Committee and may consist of one or more business criteria or individual performance criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria.  The Performance Goals may be determined on an absolute or relative basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the Compensation Committee including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index or a group of comparable companies. In addition, subject to any limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code (prior to its amendment in 2017) with respect to awards granted under the Existing LTIP that are intended to constitute "performance-based compensation," such performance measures may be subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee for changes in accounting principles, to satisfy regulatory requirements and other specified extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items or events.
Each agreement for a performance award will explain (i) the maximum amount that may be earned in the form of cash or shares of common stock, as applicable, (ii) the performance goal or goals and level of achievement that will apply to the award, (iii) the performance period over which performance is measured, and (iv) other terms that the Compensation Committee may determine that are not inconsistent with the Amended LTIP.
Prior to the payment of any compensation pursuant to a Performance-Based Award, the Compensation Committee must determine that the applicable performance goal or goals and other material terms of the award have been satisfied. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to reduce or increase the amount payable in cash and the number of shares of common stock to be issued, retained or vested pursuant to a performance award, except no such increase is permitted in the case of awards made under the Existing LTIP that were intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code (prior to its amendment in 2017).
Adjustments
The Compensation Committee is authorized under the Amended LTIP to make adjustments to awards and their terms and conditions in the event of extraordinary dividends or other extraordinary distributions, reclassifications, recapitalizations, stock splits (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend), reverse stock splits, reorganizations, mergers, combinations, consolidations, split-ups, spin-offs, repurchases or exchanges, the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or any other similar, unusual, infrequent or extraordinary corporate transaction (or event in respect of the common stock). These adjustments may include, among other things: (a) changes to (i) the number and type of shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made subject to awards (including the specific maxima and numbers of shares and individual award limitations included in the Amended LTIP), (ii) the number, amount and type of shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding awards, (iii) the grant, purchase or exercise price of outstanding awards, (iv) the securities, cash or other property deliverable under outstanding awards or (v) the performance goals appropriate to outstanding awards; or (b) making provision for a cash payment or for the substitution or exchange of outstanding awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of the award.

If the Company recapitalizes, reclassifies its capital stock or otherwise changes its capital structure or another change or event occurs that constitutes an "equity restructuring" pursuant to certain accounting standards (a "recapitalization"), (a) the Compensation Committee will equitably adjust the number and class of shares (or other securities or property) covered by each outstanding award and the terms and conditions, including the exercise price and performance criteria (if any), of such award to equitably reflect such recapitalization and will adjust the number and class of shares (or other securities or property) with respect to which awards may be granted after such recapitalization and (b) the Compensation Committee will make a corresponding and proportionate adjustment with respect to the maximum number of shares (or other securities) that may be delivered with respect to awards under the Amended LTIP, the individual award limitations and the class of shares (or other securities) available for grant.
Vesting of Grants and Awards Following Change in Control
With respect to grants and awards made on or after May 4, 2016, in the event of a change in control while the holder of the grant or award is employed by or otherwise providing services to CRC or an affiliate followed by the termination of employment or such services as a result of the change in control, unless otherwise overridden by the Compensation Committee, each such grant or award will become immediately vested and fully exercisable upon such termination and any restrictions applicable to the grant or award will lapse on that date, provided that any performance award with performance-based vesting will vest upon such termination based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance goal as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Amendment and Duration of the Amended LTIP
Our Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Amended LTIP but may not, without the approval of our stockholders:

Additionally, our Board of Directors may not, without the consent of the recipient, amend or cancel any outstanding award in a manner that adversely affects the recipient in a material way.
No award may be granted under the Amended LTIP on or after the tenth anniversary of the date upon which the plan is approved by our stockholders.
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences arising from grants and awards under the Amended LTIP. The tax consequences vary depending upon particular circumstances. The income tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof change frequently. Participants should rely upon their own tax advisors for advice concerning the specific tax consequences applicable to them, including the applicability and effect of state, local, and foreign tax laws.
Status of Options
Options granted under the Amended LTIP may be either incentive options or nonstatutory options. The tax consequences both to the participant and the Company will differ depending on whether an option is an incentive option or a nonstatutory option.

Nonstatutory Options    
As a general rule, no federal income tax is imposed on the participant upon the grant of a nonstatutory option, and the Company is not entitled to a tax deduction by reason of such grant. Generally, upon the exercise of a nonstatutory option, the participant will be treated as receiving compensation taxable as ordinary income in the year of exercise in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of common stock at the time of exercise over the option price paid for such shares. There is no item of tax preference upon such exercise. Upon a subsequent disposition of the shares received upon exercise of a nonstatutory option, any difference between the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise and the amount realized on the disposition would be treated as capital gain or loss. Upon a participant's exercise of a nonstatutory option, and subject to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may claim a deduction for compensation paid at the same time and in the same amount as compensation income is recognized to the participant assuming the Company timely satisfies any federal income tax reporting requirements. 
Incentive Options
No federal income tax is imposed on the participant upon the grant or exercise of an incentive option, except as described below under the caption "Alternative Minimum Tax." If the Participant does not dispose of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an incentive option within two years after the date the option was granted or within one year after exercise, the difference between the option price and the amount realized on a subsequent disposition of the shares would be treated as capital gain or loss. In such event, the Company would not be entitled to any deduction in connection with the grant or exercise of the option or the disposition of the shares so acquired.
If, however, a participant disposes of shares acquired pursuant to his exercise of an incentive option prior to the end of the two-year or one-year holding period noted above, the disposition would be treated as a disqualifying disposition. The participant would be treated as having received, at the time of disposition, compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise (or, in the case of a sale in which a loss would be recognized, the amount realized on such sale) over the option price, and any amount realized in excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise would be treated as capital gain. In such event, and subject to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company may claim a deduction for compensation paid at the same time and in the same amount as compensation is treated as received by the participant.
Payment of Option Price in Stock
In the case of a nonstatutory option, if the option price is paid by the delivery of shares of common stock previously acquired by the participant having a fair market value equal to the option price ("Previously Acquired Stock"), gain or loss would not be recognized on the exchange of the Previously Acquired Stock for a like number of shares pursuant to such exercise of the option. The participant's basis in the number of shares of common stock received equal to the Previously Acquired Stock would be the same as his basis in the Previously Acquired Stock. The participant would, however, be treated as receiving compensation taxable as ordinary income equal to the fair market value on the date of exercise of the shares of common stock received in excess of the number of shares of Previously Acquired Stock, and the participant's basis in such excess shares would be equal to their fair market value at the time of exercise.
In the case of an incentive option, the federal income tax consequences to the participant of the payment of the option price with Previously Acquired Stock will depend on the nature of the Previously Acquired Stock. If the Previously Acquired Stock was acquired through the exercise of a qualified stock option, an incentive option or an option granted under an employee stock purchase plan (a "Statutory Option") and if such Previously Acquired Stock is being transferred prior to the expiration of the applicable minimum statutory holding period, the transfer would be treated as a disqualifying disposition of the Previously Acquired Stock. If the Previously Acquired Stock was acquired other than pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option, or was acquired pursuant to the exercise of a statutory option but has been held for the applicable minimum statutory holding period, no gain or loss would be recognized on the exchange. In either case, (a) the participant's basis in the number of shares received equal to the number of shares of Previously Acquired Stock exchanged is the same as his basis in the Previously Acquired Stock, increased by any income recognized upon the disqualifying disposition of the Previously Acquired Stock, (b) the participant's basis in the shares received in excess of the number of Previously Acquired Stock is zero, and (c) the other incentive option rules would apply.

Stock Appreciation Rights
A participant who has been granted an SAR will not realize taxable income upon the grant of such award. Upon the exercise of the SAR, a participant will generally recognize ordinary compensation income (subject to withholding) in an amount equal to the excess of (a) the amount of cash and the fair market value of the shares of common stock received, over (b) the base price of the SAR. A participant will generally have a tax basis in any shares of common stock received pursuant to the exercise of an SAR that equals the fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise. Subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes that corresponds as to timing and amount with the compensation income recognized by a participant under the foregoing rules.
Restricted Stock
A participant who has been granted a restricted stock award will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, and the Company will not be entitled to a deduction at that time, assuming that the applicable restrictions constitute a substantial risk of forfeiture for federal income tax purposes.  When the risk of forfeiture with respect to the common stock subject to such award lapses, the participant will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of common stock at such time over the amount, if any, paid for the shares, and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. All dividends and distributions (or the cash equivalent thereof) with respect to a restricted stock award paid to the participant before the risk of forfeiture lapses will also be compensation income to the participant when paid and, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, deductible as such by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if allowed under the terms of the award, the holder of a restricted stock award may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed at the time of grant of the restricted stock award on the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of the award over the amount, if any, paid for such shares, in which case the Company, subject to Section 162(m) of the Code, will be entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount, and there will be no further federal income tax consequences with respect to the restricted stock award when the risk of forfeiture lapses. Such election must be made not later than 30 days after the grant of the restricted stock award to the participant and is irrevocable. All dividends or distributions with respect to a restricted stock award for which such an election has been made and which are paid to the participant before the risk of forfeiture lapses will be taxable as dividend income to the participant when paid and not deductible by the Company.
Stock Units
A participant who has been granted a stock unit (or phantom share unit) generally will not realize taxable income at the time of grant, and the Company will not be entitled to a deduction at that time.  At the time of payment, whether a stock unit is paid in cash or shares of common stock, the Participant will have taxable compensation and, subject to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company will have a corresponding deduction. The measure of such income and deduction, if any, will be the amount of any cash paid and the fair market value of the shares either at the time the stock unit is paid or at the time any restrictions (including restrictions under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act) subsequently lapse, depending on the nature, if any, of the restrictions imposed on the shares and whether the participant elects to be taxed without regard to any such restrictions.
Other Awards
The tax treatment of other awards will depend on the particular terms and conditions of the award. As a general rule, at the time the award vests (or, if the award is not subject to a vesting requirement, at the time the award is granted) the participant will recognize taxable income and, subject to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. A participant will recognize ordinary compensation income upon receipt of cash pursuant to a cash award or, if earlier, at the time the cash is otherwise made available for the participant to draw upon.

Section 162(m) of the Code
Section 162(m) of the Code precludes a public corporation from taking a deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid in a taxable year with respect to each of certain of the corporation's current and former executive officers, including any compensation relating to an award granted under a plan similar to the Amended LTIP. However, certain awards under the Existing LTIP may qualify for an exception to this limitation as compensation intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" prior to the amendment of Section 162(m) of the Code in 2017.
Parachute Payment Sanctions
Certain provisions in the Amended LTIP or included in an agreement incident to the plan may afford a participant special protections or payments that are contingent on a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets. To the extent triggered by the occurrence of any such event, these special protections or payments may constitute "parachute payments" which, when aggregated with other parachute payments received by the participant, if any, could result in the participant's receiving "excess parachute payments" (a portion of which would be allocated to those protections or payments derived from the plan). The Company would not be allowed a deduction for any such excess parachute payments and the participant would be subject to a nondeductible 20% excise tax upon such payments in addition to income tax otherwise owed with respect to such payments.
General
The Amended LTIP is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
The foregoing summary is for general information only and is intended to summarize the United States federal income tax consequences to participants arising from common transactions under the Amended LTIP. This description is based upon the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as currently in effect and the Treasury Regulations and proposed Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service rulings thereunder, which are subject to change (possibly retroactively). The tax treatment of a participant in the plan may vary depending on his or her particular situation and may, therefore, be subject to special rules not discussed above. In addition, Section 409A of the Code provides that deferred compensation, as defined therein, will be subject to an additional 20% tax unless it meets certain restrictions set forth in Section 409A of the Code and guidance promulgated thereunder. Although the Company intends for awards issued under the Amended LTIP to comply with Section 409A of the Code, no assurance can be given that they will. Each participant should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of participation in the plan, including the application of any state, local and foreign tax laws which may differ from the United States federal tax treatment and the effect of other state, local and foreign laws, including community property laws.
Clawback
To the extent required by applicable law or any applicable securities exchange listing standards, or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, awards and amounts paid or payable with respect to awards will be subject to the provisions of any applicable clawback policies or procedures adopted by the Company. The clawback policies or procedures may provide for forfeiture, repurchase and/or recoupment of awards and amounts paid or payable with respect to awards. In addition, the Company reserves the right, without the consent of any participant or beneficiary, to adopt any such clawback policies and procedures, including such policies and procedures that have retroactive effect.
Effective November 4, 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the Compensation Recoupment and Clawback Policy, which provides that in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws, the Company will have the right, as to any "Covered Employee," to cause the Company to require the reimbursement by the Covered Employee, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of all or a portion of any incentive compensation. The full text of the policy can be found on the Company's website at www.crc.com.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
"FOR" PROPOSAL 4 TO APPROVE THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN.
Proposal 5(a), Proposal 5(b) and Proposal 5(c): Approval of Amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation to Change Each Supermajority Stockholder Vote Requirement to a Majority Vote Requirement
The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended most recently as of May 31, 2016 (the "Charter"), provides in part that:
(1)  Following the date when CRC's classified board structure expires pursuant to the terms of the Charter, directors may only be removed at any time (a) for Cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote generally for the election of directors and (b) without Cause upon the  affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote generally for the election of directors, in the case of each of (a) and (b), acting at a meeting of the stockholders;
(2)  CRC's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") may not be altered, amended, restated or repealed by the stockholders except by the vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon; and
(3) Any alteration, amendment, repeal or restatement of the Fifth Article, the Sixth Article, the Seventh Article, the Eighth Article, the Tenth Article, the Eleventh Article, the Twelfth Article or the Thirteenth Article of the Charter will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon. 
Our Board of Directors reviews corporate governance practices on a continuing basis. In light of evolving practices and stockholder input, our Board of Directors has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its investors to seek to amend the Charter to change each of the supermajority voting requirements to a requirement for an affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares. The majority voting requirements will give stockholders enhanced flexibility to change the Company's governing documents, while ensuring that fundamental changes made by stockholders will be acceptable to the holders of a majority of stockholders. Our Board of Directors will retain the ability to amend the Bylaws.
The proposed amendments may, if adopted, make it easier for one or more stockholders to change the Company's corporate governance and, therefore, make it more difficult for our Board of Directors to protect other stockholders' interests. Nevertheless, there are other actions that our Board of Directors can take to protect stockholders' interests on such occasions. 
Our Board of Directors is proposing these amendments for the reasons described above. It does not otherwise have any current plans to amend the Bylaws or any of the Charter provisions described below that currently require a supermajority vote, or to take or propose to take any action contemplated by such provisions, except that if Proposal 5(b) passes, then effective at the same time the Charter changes, the Bylaws will be immediately amended to conform the Bylaws to the Charter and to provide that the Bylaws may be amended by stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares. The general description of provisions of our Charter and Bylaws and the proposed amendments set forth here and below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of Appendices C-1, C-2 and C-3.

 Proposals Requiring Your Vote 
The Board recommends that the STOCKholders vote to approve each of the three proposals.
Proposal 5(a): Change the Supermajority Vote Requirement for Stockholders to Remove Directors Without Cause to a Majority Vote Requirement
The Fifth Article (Section 3) of the Charter currently requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote for the election of directors in order for directors to be removed without Cause by the stockholders following the date when CRC's classified board structure expires pursuant to the terms of the Charter. If the stockholders approve this Proposal 5(a), then the Fifth Article (Section 3) of the Charter will allow stockholders to remove directors with or without Cause upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC generally entitled to vote for the election of directors. Appendix C-1 shows the proposed changes to the Fifth Article (Section 3) of the Charter.  
The Board recommends that the STOCKholders vote
"for" Proposal 5(a) to Change the Supermajority
Vote Requirement for STOCKholders to Remove
Directors Without Cause to a Majority Vote Requirement.
Proposal 5(b): Change the Supermajority Vote Requirement for Stockholders to Amend the Bylaws to a Majority Vote Requirement 
The Eighth Article of the Charter currently provides that the stockholders can amend the Bylaws only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon. If the stockholders approve this Proposal 5(b), then the Eighth Article of the Charter will allow stockholders to amend the Bylaws by an affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon. 
In addition, if the stockholders approve this Proposal 5(b), then effective at the same time the Charter changes, the Bylaws will be immediately amended to conform the Bylaws to the Charter and provide that the Bylaws may be amended by stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares. Currently, Section 8.1 of the Bylaws provides that the stockholders can amend the Bylaws only by the affirmative vote of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of CRC entitled to vote thereon. The Board has amended the Bylaws, contingent and effective upon a filing of a certificate of amendment of the Eighth Article of the Charter with the Secretary of the State of Delaware in accordance with this Proposal 5(b). If the Board's amendment becomes effective upon the effectiveness of the Charter amendment following stockholder approval of this Proposal 5(b), the Bylaws will allow stockholders to amend the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon.
Therefore, if this Proposal 5(b) is approved by the stockholders, all of the supermajority voting requirements in the Charter and Bylaws regarding the amendment of the Bylaws will be replaced with an affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of stock standard. Appendix C-2 shows the proposed changes to the Eighth Article of the Charter.

Proposal 5(c): Change the Supermajority Vote Requirement for Stockholders to Amend Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation to a Majority Vote Requirement
The Tenth Article of the Charter currently requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC in order for stockholders to amend certain Charter provisions. These are:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Fifth Article, which addresses various provisions regarding the Board, including with respect to the removal of directors (as set forth in Proposal 5(a));  
• The Sixth Article, which requires stockholders to act by meeting;  
• The Seventh Article, which provides that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board or the Board of Directors;  
• The Eighth Article, which addresses amendments to the Bylaws (as set forth in Proposal 5(b));  
• The Tenth Article, which addresses amendments to the Charter (as set forth in this Proposal 5(c));  
• The Eleventh Article, which selects the forum for certain disputes;  
• The Twelfth Article, which addresses director interests in certain business opportunities; and  
• The Thirteenth Article, which states that Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law applies to CRC. 
[END TABLE]
If the stockholders approve this Proposal 5(c), then the Tenth Article of the Charter will allow stockholders to amend the provisions of the Charter described above by an affirmative vote of the outstanding shares of stock of CRC entitled to vote thereon. Appendix C-3 shows the proposed changes to the Tenth Article of the Charter.
The Board recommends that the STOCKholders vote
"for" Proposal 5(c) to Change the Supermajority
Vote Requirement for STOCKholders to Amend
Certain Provisions of the

Therefore, if Proposal 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) are approved by the stockholders, all of the supermajority voting requirements in the Charter and Bylaws will be replaced with an affirmative vote of a majority of outstanding shares of stock standard.

Record Date
At the close of business on March 11, 2019, the "Record Date" for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting, there were 48,799,261 shares of common stock outstanding, each share of which is entitled to one vote. Common stock is the only class of our outstanding securities entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Appointment of Proxy Holders
Our Board of Directors asks you to appoint Todd A. Stevens and William E. Albrecht as your proxy holders ("Proxy Holders") to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. You make this appointment by using one of the voting methods described below.
Quorum and Discretionary Authority
The presence at the Annual Meeting of a majority of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum in order to transact business at the Annual Meeting. Your shares are counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person or if you properly return a proxy by Internet, telephone or mail. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.
The Chairman of the Annual Meeting or, if directed by the Chairman of the Annual Meeting, a majority of the shares so represented, may adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum represented, and the Proxy Holders will vote the proxies they have been authorized to vote at the Annual Meeting in favor of such an adjournment. In the event a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any of the items proposed by our Board of Directors have not been received, the Chairman of the meeting or the Proxy Holders may propose one or more adjournments of the Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. A stockholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this proxy statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient proxies have been received and it is otherwise appropriate.
Our Board of Directors does not know of any other matters that are to be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. However, if other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will provide the Proxy Holders with the authority to vote on those matters and nominees in accordance with such persons' discretion. Where a stockholder has appropriately specified how a proxy is to be voted, it will be voted by the Proxy Holders in accordance with the specification.

How to Vote Shares Registered in Your Name
If you own shares that are registered in your own name, you are a "registered stockholder" and you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. You also may vote by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting in any of the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   BY INTERNET    BY TELEPHONE    IN PERSON    BY MAIL 
 You may submit a proxy electronically on the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Please have the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in hand when you log onto the website. Internet voting facilities will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 7, 2019.  If you request paper copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may submit a proxy by telephone using the toll-free number listed on the proxy card. Please have your proxy card in hand when you call. Telephone voting facilities will close and no longer be available after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 7, 2019.  You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting by completing a ballot, which will be available at the Annual Meeting. Please note that attending the Annual Meeting without completing a ballot will not count as a vote.  If you request paper copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may indicate your vote by completing, signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the reply envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
For stockholders who have their shares voted by duly submitting a proxy by Internet, telephone or mail, the Proxy Holders will vote all shares represented by such valid proxies in accordance with the stockholders' instructions. If a stockholder signs and mails a proxy card, but does not indicate how the Proxy Holders should vote, the Proxy Holders will vote in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations as set forth above.
If you received more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, your shares are likely registered in different names or with different addresses or are in more than one account. You must separately vote the shares shown on each Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that you receive in order for all of your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting.
How to Vote Shares Held in "Street Name"
If you hold shares through a brokerage firm, trustee, bank, other financial intermediary or nominee (known as shares held in "street name"), you will receive from that broker, trustee, bank, financial intermediary or other nominee (the "intermediary") a voting instruction form that will explain how to direct the voting of your shares through the intermediary, which may include the ability to provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone.
If your shares are held in street name through a brokerage firm that is a member of the NYSE and you want to vote on any of the proposals to be submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting (except as to Proposal 2), you MUST indicate how you wish your shares to be voted. The broker will vote shares held by you in street name in accordance with your voting instructions, as indicated on your signed voting instruction form or by the instructions you provide via the Internet or by telephone. Absent such instructions, the proxy submitted by the broker with respect to your shares will indicate that the broker is not able to cast a vote with respect to the matter, which is commonly referred to as a "broker non-vote." Accordingly, if your shares are held in street name, it is important that you provide voting instructions to the broker or other intermediary so that your vote will be counted. Under NYSE rules, Proposal 2 is considered a "routine matter," and thus a broker is permitted in its discretion to cast a vote on this proposal as to your shares in the event that you do not provide the broker with voting instructions.
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION    84

General Information 
If you hold shares in street name and wish to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must first obtain a valid proxy from the intermediary. To attend the Annual Meeting in person (regardless of whether you intend to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting), you should follow the instructions under "Attending the Annual Meeting in Person" below.
If you received more than one voting instruction form, your shares are likely registered in different names or with different addresses or are in more than one account. You must separately follow the foregoing voting procedures for each voting instruction form that you receive in order for all of your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Revoking or Changing a Proxy
If you are a registered stockholder, you may revoke your proxy at any time before your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting again through the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on May 7, 2019; 
• requesting, completing and mailing in a new paper proxy card, as outlined in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials; 
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting by completing a ballot; however, attending the Annual Meeting without completing a ballot will not revoke any previously submitted proxy; or

If you are a street-name stockholder and you vote by proxy, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee in accordance with that entity's procedures.
Required Vote and Method of Counting
Proposal 1. Election of Directors
We have adopted a majority voting policy with respect to the election of directors to the Board of Directors. See "Majority Voting for Directors" below. The election of directors involves a matter on which a broker (or other nominee) does not have "discretionary" authority to vote. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this item, your broker may not vote your shares with respect to this proposal. In such case, a broker non-vote will occur. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. 
Proposal 2. Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person, or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting, is required to approve Proposal 2. Proposal 2 involves a matter on which a broker (or other nominee) does have "discretionary" authority to vote. Even if you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this item, your broker may vote your shares with respect to this proposal in its discretion. With respect to Proposal 2, a vote of "ABSTAIN" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST."

General Information 
Proposal 3. Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation; andProposal 4. Approve the Amended LTIP
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person, or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, and entitled to vote on the matter at the Annual Meeting, is required to approve the recommendations in Proposals 3 and 4. Such proposals involve matters on which a broker (or other nominee) does not have "discretionary" authority to vote. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to these items, your broker may not vote your shares with respect to these proposals. In such case, a broker non-vote will occur. Broker non-votes are not considered and will have no effect on the outcome of Proposals 3 and 4. Abstentions are treated as present or represented and voting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST."
With respect to Proposal 3, while this vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on the Company or the Board of Directors nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duty on, the Company or the Board of Directors. However, the views of our stockholders are important to us, and our Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. We urge you to read the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," including the compensation tables that follow, which discusses in detail how our executive compensation program implements our compensation philosophy.
Proposals 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c). Change the Supermajority Vote Requirements to a Majority Vote Requirement for (a) Stockholders to Remove Directors Without Cause; (b) Stockholders to Amend the Bylaws; and (c) Stockholders to Amend Certain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation
Stockholders will vote on Proposals 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) separately, and the approval of each proposal is not conditioned on the approval of the other proposals. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% in voting power of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to approve each of Proposals 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c). Such proposals involve matters on which a broker (or other nominee) does not have "discretionary" authority to vote. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to these items, your broker may not vote your shares with respect to these proposals. In such case, a broker non-vote will occur. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes cast "AGAINST" the approval of these proposals. These charter amendments, if approved, will not be effective until we file certificates of amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware following the Annual Meeting.
Majority Voting for Directors
We have adopted a majority voting policy with respect to the election of directors to the Board of Directors. In accordance with our Bylaws, in order to be elected as a director, a director nominee must receive more votes cast "FOR" than "AGAINST" his or her election. This policy does not apply if the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected on or after the tenth day preceding the date we first mail the Notice of Annual Meeting, in which case directors shall be elected by a plurality of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting.
Unless the election is by plurality vote as set forth above, if an incumbent nominee for director receives an equal or greater number of votes cast "AGAINST" than votes cast "FOR" his or her election, the nominee shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. Such director resignation will become effective upon acceptance by the Board of Directors of such resignation based on any factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. The foregoing summary is qualified by the terms of our majority voting policy, which are included in our Bylaws.

Method and Cost of Soliciting and Tabulating Votes
The Board of Directors is providing these proxy materials to you in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting. In addition to solicitation by mail, our officers, directors and employees may solicit proxies personally or by telephone, facsimile or electronic means. These officers, directors and employees will not receive any extra compensation for these services. In addition, we will make arrangements with brokerage houses, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries to send proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our stock, and we will reimburse them for postage and clerical expenses. We will bear the costs of the solicitation, including the cost of the preparation, assembly, printing and, where applicable, mailing of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, the Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, this proxy statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished by us to our stockholders. In addition, we have hired D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist us in soliciting proxies, which it may do by telephone or in person. We will pay D.F. King & Co. a fee of $7,500, plus expenses.
Attending the Annual Meeting in Person
Only stockholders of record or their legal proxy holders as of the Record Date or our invited guests may attend the Annual Meeting in person. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you must present a valid form of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. In addition to such personal identification, you will need an admission ticket or proof of ownership of CRC stock to enter the Annual Meeting. If your shares are registered in your name, you will find an admission ticket attached to the notice regarding the internet availability of proxy materials or the proxy card sent to you. If your shares are held in street name with a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to bring a copy of your brokerage statement or other documentation reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date.
No cameras, telephones, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted at the Annual Meeting. No banners, signs, firearms or weapons will be allowed in the meeting room. We reserve the right to inspect all items entering the meeting room.
The Annual Meeting will be held at the Bakersfield Marriott at the Convention Center, located at 801 Truxtun Avenue, Bakersfield, California 93301.
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
On March 26, 2019, we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners who owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on March 11, 2019. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contained instructions on how to access the proxy materials and vote online. We have made these proxy materials available to you over the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered paper versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors for the Annual Meeting.
Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by e-mail will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.

Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations
Any stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal for inclusion in the proxy material and for presentation at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders may do so by following the procedures set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. In accordance with Rule 14a-8, stockholder proposals should be received by our Corporate Secretary at the address below not later than November 27, 2019.
For proposals that are not submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement under Rule 14a-8, as more specifically provided in our Bylaws, in order for nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors or a proposal of any other business to be properly brought before the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, it must be submitted in accordance with our Bylaws and must be received at our principal executive offices no earlier than the close of business on January 9, 2020 and not later than the close of business on February 8, 2020.

Detailed information for submitting recommendations for director nominees is available upon written request to our Corporate Secretary at the address listed above.
Householding of Proxy Materials
The SEC's proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, banks and other nominees, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of proxy materials to those stockholders. This method of delivery, often referred to as "householding," helps to reduce the amount of duplicative information that stockholders receive and lowers printing and mailing costs for companies.
We are householding proxy materials for stockholders of record in connection with the Annual Meeting unless otherwise notified. We have been notified that certain intermediaries may household proxy materials as well. If you hold your shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee that has determined to household proxy materials, only one set of proxy materials will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless you notify your broker, bank or other nominee to the contrary.
We will promptly deliver you a separate copy of the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting if you so request by calling (866) 659-2647 or (718) 921-8124 (for international callers) or you may contact your broker, bank or other nominee to make a similar request.
Please contact us or your broker, bank or other nominee directly if you have questions or wish to receive separate copies of our proxy materials in the future. You should also contact us or your broker, bank or other nominee if you wish to request delivery of a single copy if you are currently receiving multiple copies. These options are available to you at any time.

Reserve Replacement Ratio
The all-in reserve replacement ratio is calculated for a specified period using the proved oil-equivalent additions from extensions and discoveries, improved recovery, revisions and purchases, divided by oil-equivalent production. There is no guarantee that historical sources of reserves additions will continue as many factors that are fully or partially outside management's control, including commodity prices, availability of capital and the underlying geology, affect reserves additions. Management uses this measure to gauge the results of its capital program. Other oil and gas producers may use different methods to calculate replacement ratios, which may affect comparability.

Finding and Development Costs
We believe that reporting our finding and development costs can aid investors in their evaluation of our ability to add proved reserves at a reasonable cost but is not a substitute for required GAAP disclosures. Various factors, primarily timing differences and effects of commodity price changes, can cause finding and development costs associated with a particular period's reserves additions to be imprecise. For example, we will need to make more investments in order to develop the proved undeveloped reserves added during the year and any future revisions may change the actual measure from that presented above. In addition, part of the 2018 costs were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves from prior years to proved developed reserves. In our calculations, we have not estimated future costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves added in 2018 or removed costs related to proved undeveloped reserves added in prior periods. Our calculations of finding and development costs may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.
We calculate all-in finding and development costs by dividing the costs incurred for the year, including acquisitions, by the amount of oil-equivalent proved reserves added in the same year from improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, performance-related revisions, price-related revisions and purchases.

4.3DELEGATION - Subject to Section 4.5, the Board may delegate different levels of authority to different committees with administrative and grant authority under this Plan, provided that each designated committee granting any awards hereunder shall consist exclusively of a member or members of the Board.  A majority of the members of the acting committee shall constitute a quorum.  The vote of a majority of the members present assuming the presence of a quorum or the unanimous written consent of the Committee shall constitute action by the committee.  The Committee may delegate authority to grant awards under this Plan for new employees to an officer of the Company who is also a director and may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary functions to individuals who are officers or employees of the Company or a subsidiary or to third parties.  In addition, subject to the constraints of applicable law, the Committee may from time to time, in its sole discretion, delegate to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company the administration (or interpretation of any provision) of this Plan, and the right to grant awards under this Plan, insofar as such administration (and interpretation) and power to grant awards relates to any person who is not then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including any successor section to the same or similar effect).  Any such delegation may be effective only so long as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is a member of the Board, and the Committee may revoke such delegation at any time.  The Committee may put any conditions and restrictions on the powers that may be exercised by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company upon such delegation as the Committee determines in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delegation pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be made to the extent that such delegation would (i) result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)(1) for awards granted to Eligible Persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company or (ii) cause awards made under the Prior Plan that were intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) (prior to its amendment in 2017) to fail to so qualify.
4.4BIFURCATION - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the provisions of this Plan may at any time be bifurcated by the Board or the Committee in any manner so that provisions of any award agreement (or this Plan) intended or required in order to satisfy the applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 or other applicable law, to the extent permitted thereby, are applicable only to persons subject to those provisions and to those awards to those persons intended to satisfy the requirements of the applicable legal restriction.
4.5AWARDS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS - Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary and without being subject to management discretion, the Board, acting through the non-employee Directors only, shall have the authority, in its sole and absolute discretion, to select non-employee Directors to receive awards other than ISOs under this Plan subject to the limitations of Section 3.2.  The Board, acting through the non-employee Directors only shall set the terms of any such awards in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Board, acting through the non-employee Directors only, shall be responsible for administering and construing such awards in substantially the same manner that the Committee administers and construes awards to other Eligible Persons.

5.2PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS - 
The right of a participant to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any type of award listed in Section 5.1, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance conditions as may be specified by the Committee.  The Committee may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, and may exercise its discretion to reduce or increase the amounts payable under any award subject to performance conditions, except as limited under the Prior Plan in the case of awards made under the Prior Plan that were intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) (prior to its amendment in 2017).
(a)Performance Goals Generally.  The Performance Goals for Performance-Based Awards shall consist of one or more business criteria or individual performance criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of such criteria, as specified by the Committee consistent with this Section 5.2, which level may also be expressed in terms of a specified increase or decrease in the particular criteria compared to a past period.  The Committee may determine that Performance-Based Awards shall be granted, exercised and/or settled upon achievement of any one Performance Goal or that two or more of the Performance Goals must be achieved as a condition to grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Performance-Based Awards.  Performance Goals may differ for Performance-Based Awards granted to any one participant or to different participants.  The Performance Goals may be determined on an absolute or relative basis or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the Committee including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index or a group of comparable companies.  In addition, subject to any limitations under Section 162(m) (prior to its amendment in 2017) with respect to awards granted under the Prior Plan that are intended to constitute "performance-based compensation," such performance measures may be subject to adjustment by the Committee for changes in accounting principles, to satisfy regulatory requirements and other specified extraordinary, unusual or infrequent items or events.
(b)Performance Period.  Achievement of Performance Goals in respect of Performance-Based Awards shall be measured over a performance period of up to ten years, as specified by the Committee.
(c)Performance-Based Award Pool.  The Committee may establish a Performance-Based Award pool, which shall be an unfunded pool, for purposes of measuring performance of the Company in connection with Performance-Based Awards.  The amount of such Performance-Based Award pool shall be based upon the achievement of a Performance Goal or Goals during the given performance period, as specified by the Committee in accordance with this Section 5.2.  The Committee may specify the amount of the Performance-Based Award pool as a percentage of any of such criteria, a percentage thereof in excess of a threshold amount, or as another amount which need not bear a strictly mathematical relationship to such criteria.
(d)Settlement of Performance-Based Awards; Other Terms.  After the end of each performance period, the Committee shall determine the amount, if any, of (A) the Performance-Based Award pool, and the maximum amount of the potential Performance-Based Award payable to each Participant in the Performance-Based Award pool, or (B) the amount of the potential Performance-Based Award otherwise payable to each Participant.  Settlement of such Performance-Based Awards shall be in cash, Stock, other awards or other property, in the discretion of the Committee.  The Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or increase the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with such Performance-Based Awards, but may not exercise discretion to increase any such amount payable with respect to an award under the Prior Plan that was intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) (prior to its amendment in 2017).  The Committee shall specify the circumstances in which such Performance-Based Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of termination of employment by the participant prior to the end of a performance period or settlement of Performance-Based Awards.

 Annex B Amended and Restated LTIP 
(e)Written Determinations.  All determinations by the Committee as to the establishment of Performance Goals, the amount of any Performance-Based Award pool or potential individual Performance-Based Awards and as to the achievement of Performance Goals relating to and final settlement of Performance-Based Awards under this Section 5.2 shall be certified in writing in the case of any award under the Prior Plan that was intended to constitute "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) (prior to its amendment in 2017).  The Committee may not delegate any responsibility relating to such Performance-Based Awards.
5.3CONSIDERATION FOR SHARES - Shares may be issued pursuant to an award for any lawful consideration as determined by the Committee, including, without limitation, services rendered by the recipient of such award, but shall not be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration.  Awards may be payable in cash, stock or other consideration or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall designate in or (except as required by Section 5.2) by amendment to the terms and conditions governing such award.
5.4LIMITED RIGHTS - Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee or this Plan or in the applicable award terms and conditions, a participant will not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership as to any Shares not actually delivered to and held of record by the participant.  Except as described in Section 5.11, no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a stockholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery.
5.5OPTION/STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT PRICING, TERM LIMITS AND VESTING - The purchase price per share of the Shares covered by any option or the base price of any stock appreciation right shall be determined by the Committee at the time of the grant, but, except in the case of a Substitute Award, shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.  No option or stock appreciation right shall be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date of grant.  An award may be converted or convertible, notwithstanding the foregoing limits, into or payable in, Shares or another award that otherwise satisfies the requirements of this Plan.
No option, stock appreciation right or other non-full value appreciation award granted under this Plan on or after the Effective Date may vest in less than one year from its date of grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, up to five percent of the available Shares authorized for issuance under this Plan as of the Effective Date may be subject to options, stock appreciation rights or other non-full value appreciation awards that vest (in full or in part) in less than one year from their date of grant (the "Five Percent Basket").  Further, any option, stock appreciation right or other non-full value award granted under this Plan may vest in full or in part upon death or disability of the participant, or upon a Change in Control, and such vesting shall not count against the Five Percent Basket.
5.6SPECIAL LIMITATIONS RELATING TO ISOS - An ISO may be granted only to an individual who is employed by the Company or any "parent corporation" or "subsidiary corporation" (as such terms are defined in Section 424 of the Code) of the Company at the time the ISO is granted.  To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the respective ISO is granted) of stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by an individual during any calendar year under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its parent and subsidiary corporations, within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code, exceeds $100,000 or such other amount as may be prescribed under Section 422 of the Code or applicable regulations or rulings from time to time, such ISOs shall be treated as options that do not constitute ISOs.  The Committee shall determine, in accordance with applicable provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations, and other administrative pronouncements, which of a participant's ISOs will not constitute ISOs because of such limitation and shall notify the participant of such determination as soon as practicable after such determination.  No ISO shall be granted to an individual if, at the time the option is granted, such individual owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of its parent or subsidiary corporation, within the meaning of Section 422(b)(6) of the Code, unless (i) at the time such option is granted, the option price is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share and (ii) such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 421 or 422 of the Code, an ISO shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by such participant or the participant's guardian or legal representative.

5.7TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS - Unless otherwise expressly provided in or permitted by this Section 5.7, by applicable law or by the award terms and conditions (i) all awards are nontransferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (ii) awards shall be exercised only by the holder; and (iii) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to an award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the holder.  No award may be transferred for consideration to a financial institution.
5.7.1Exceptions by Committee Action - The Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit an award to be transferred for estate and/or tax planning purposes and on a basis consistent with the Company's lawful issue of securities and the incentive purposes of the award and this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, awards intended as ISOs or restricted stock awards for purposes of the Code shall be subject to any and all additional transfer restrictions necessary to preserve their status as ISOs or restricted shares, as the case may be, under the Code.
5.7.2Exclusions - The exercise and transfer restrictions in this Section 5.7 shall not apply to:
(a)transfers to the Company,
(b)the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the participant's death or, if the participant has died, transfers to or exercise by the participant's beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution,
(c)transfers pursuant to a domestic relations order (if approved or ratified by the Committee), if (in the case of ISOs) permitted by the Code,
(d)if the participant has suffered a Disability, permitted transfers to or exercises on behalf of the holder by his or her legal representative, or
(e)the authorization by the Committee of "cashless exercise" procedures with third parties who finance or who otherwise facilitate the exercise of awards consistent with applicable laws and the express authorization of the Committee.
5.8TAX WITHHOLDING - The Company and any of its Affiliates are authorized to withhold from any award granted, or any payment relating to an award under this Plan, including from a distribution of Shares, amounts of withholding and other taxes due or potentially payable in connection with any transaction involving an award, and to take such other action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company, its Affiliates and participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and other tax obligations relating to any award.  This authority shall include authority to withhold or receive Shares or other property and to make cash payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a participant's tax obligations, either on a mandatory or elective basis in the discretion of the Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Affiliates may, in their sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, withhold or permit the participant to elect to have the Company or its Affiliate withhold a sufficient number of Shares that are otherwise issuable to the participant pursuant to an award (or allow the surrender of Shares by the participant to the Company or its Affiliate).  The number of Shares that may be so withheld or surrendered shall be limited to the number of Shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates for U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. income and social insurance taxes and payroll taxes, as determined by the Committee.  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 5.8, withholding taxes may be based on rates in excess of the minimum required tax withholding rates if the Committee (a) determines, with respect to an award granted to an Eligible Person who is not a non-employee Director, that such withholding would not result in adverse accounting, tax or other consequences to the Company or any Affiliate (other than immaterial administrative, reporting or similar consequences) and (b) authorizes withholding at such greater rates.

5.9CASH AWARDS - The Committee shall have the express authority to pay awards in cash under this Plan, whether in lieu of, in addition to or as part of another award.
5.10TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE - If an Eligible Person's employment with or service to the Company or to any Affiliate terminates for any reason, his or her outstanding awards may thereafter be exercised (if at all) to the extent provided in the agreement evidencing such award, or as otherwise determined by the Committee. 
5.11DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS – No dividend equivalents shall be granted in connection with stock options, stock appreciation rights or other non-full value appreciation awards granted under this Plan on or after the Effective Date.  Any cash dividend distributed with respect to a Share subject to a restricted stock award granted on or after the Effective Date shall be treated in the following manner as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the award agreement: (a) accrued and paid at such time, if any, as the underlying restricted stock to which it relates vests and settles; (b) reinvested in additional Shares (or restricted stock), based on the Fair Market Value on the dividend payment date, and paid at such time (or, in the case of additional shares of restricted stock, vest at such time), if any, as the underlying restricted stock to which it relates vests and settles; or (c) any combination of the foregoing.  The Committee may provide that restricted stock units and other full-value awards (other than restricted stock) awarded under this Plan shall be entitled to an amount per unit equal in value to the cash dividend, if any, paid per Share on issued and outstanding Shares, on the dividend payment dates occurring during the period between the date on which the award is granted and the date on which such award is settled under this Plan (or such other period designated by the Committee).  Any such paid amounts with respect to such awards granted on or after the Effective Date shall be treated in the following manner as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the award agreement: (i) accrued and paid at such time, if any, as the underlying award to which it relates vests and settles; (ii) reinvested in additional Shares, based on the Fair Market Value on the dividend payment date, and paid at such time, if any, as the underlying award to which it relates vests and settles; or (iii) any combination of the foregoing.  Notwithstanding any preceding provision in this Section 5.11 to the contrary, any cash, stock, or other property distributed as a dividend or otherwise with respect to any restricted stock, restricted stock unit or other full-value award granted under this Plan on or after the Effective Date shall be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the underlying restricted stock, restricted stock unit or other full-value award with respect to which such cash, stock or other property has been distributed.

[END TABLE]
This amended and restated Plan was adopted by the Board on February 19, 2019, and is subject to approval by the Company's stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders.  If this amendment and restatement is not so approved by the stockholders, then this amendment and restatement shall be void ab initio, and the Prior Plan shall continue in effect as if this amendment and restatement had not occurred, and any awards previously granted under the Prior Plan shall continue in effect under the terms of the grant and the Prior Plan; provided, further, that thereafter awards may continue to be granted pursuant to the terms of the Prior Plan, as in effect prior to this amendment and restatement and as may be otherwise amended thereafter.  This amended and restated Plan shall become effective on the Effective Date if it is approved on such date by the Company's stockholders, and this Plan shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board to terminate this Plan at any time pursuant to Section 8.1, until all Shares subject to it shall have been purchased or acquired according to the provisions herein.  However, in no event may an award be granted under this Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date.  After this Plan is terminated, no future awards may be granted pursuant to this Plan, but awards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and this Plan's terms and conditions.  In addition, any then outstanding award may be amended thereafter in any manner that would have been permitted earlier, except that no such amendment shall increase the number of Shares subject to, comprising or referenced in the award or reduce the exercise or base price of an option or stock appreciation right or permit cash payments in an amount that exceeds the limits of Section 3 (as adjusted pursuant to Section 7.2).

10.4COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS - Nothing herein or in any award granted hereunder shall require the Company to issue any shares with respect to any award if that issuance would, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, constitute a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any similar or superseding statute or statutes, any other applicable statute or regulation, or the rules of any applicable securities exchange or securities association, as then in effect.  
10.5CLAWBACK - To the extent required by applicable law or any applicable securities exchange listing standards, or as otherwise determined by the Board or Committee, awards and amounts paid or payable pursuant to or with respect to awards shall be subject to the provisions of any applicable clawback policies or procedures adopted by the Company, which clawback policies or procedures may provide for forfeiture, repurchase and/or recoupment of awards and amounts paid or payable pursuant to or with respect to awards.

10.6SECTION 409A - In the event that any award granted pursuant to this Plan provides for a deferral of compensation within the meaning of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, it is the general intention, but not the obligation, of the Company to design such award to comply with the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules and such award should be interpreted accordingly.  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, to the extent that the Committee determines that any award under this Plan may be subject to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, the Committee may, without a participant's consent, adopt such amendments to this Plan and the applicable award agreement or take any other actions (including amendments and actions with retroactive effect), that the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines are necessary or appropriate to preserve the intended tax treatment of the award, including, without limitation, actions intended to (a) exempt such award from the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules, or (b) comply with the requirements of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.6 shall create any obligation on the part of the Company or any Affiliate to adopt any such amendment or take any other such action or any liability for any failure to do so. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise compensate any participant for any taxes or interest imposed under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Rules or similar provisions of state or foreign law.
