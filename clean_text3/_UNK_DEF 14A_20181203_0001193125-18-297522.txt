Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held On December 3, 2018 
PROXY STATEMENT 
GENERAL 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors (the "Board") of FS Investment Corporation IV, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held at 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Monday December 3, 2018, at 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112, and any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This proxy statement and the accompanying materials are being mailed on or about October 17, 2018 to stockholders of record described below and are available on the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com/investments/funds/fsic-iv. 
All properly executed proxies representing shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Shares") received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. If no specification is made, the Shares will be voted FOR: 
(i) the proposal to elect each of the director nominees named herein to the Board to serve until the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified (the "Director Proposal"); and 
(ii) the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 (the "Accountant Proposal"). 
Any stockholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise. Any stockholder who executes a proxy may revoke it with respect to any proposal by attending the Annual Meeting and voting his or her Shares in person, or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later-dated proxy to the Company at the above address prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. 
Quorum 
Stockholders of the Company are entitled to one vote for each Share held. Under the Second Articles of Amendment and Restatement of the Company (the "Charter"), one third of the number of Shares entitled to cast votes, present in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions will be treated as Shares that are present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Annual Meeting. 
Adjournments 
In the event that a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting or the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than the announcement at the Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought. Any business that might have been transacted at the Annual Meeting originally called may be transacted at any such adjourned session(s) at which a quorum is present.  If it appears that there are not enough votes to approve any proposal at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the record date originally fixed for the Annual Meeting without notice, other than announcement at the Annual Meeting, to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies for the Company will vote proxies held by them for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
If sufficient votes in favor of one or more proposals have been received by the time of the Annual Meeting, the proposals will be acted upon and such actions will be final, regardless of any subsequent adjournment to consider other proposals. 
Record Date 
The Board has fixed the close of business on October 10, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting and adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the Record Date, there were 31,322,290 Shares outstanding. 
Required Vote 
Director Proposal. Each director nominee shall be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present. Plurality voting means that the director nominee with the most votes for a particular seat is elected for that seat. Because all of the director nominees are running unopposed, all eleven director nominees are expected to be elected as directors, as all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Each Share may be voted for as many individuals as there are director nominees and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote with respect to the Director Proposal. There will be no cumulative voting with respect to the Director Proposal. 
Accountant Proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present, is required to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote with respect to the Accountant Proposal. 
Broker Non-Votes 
Shares for which brokers have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Shares and do not have, or choose not to exercise, discretionary authority to vote the Shares on certain proposals (which are considered "broker non-votes" with respect to such proposals) will be treated as Shares present for quorum purposes. Because the Director Proposal is a non-routine matter, brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter. Broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and thus have no effect on the Director Proposal. Because the Accountant Proposal is a routine matter, brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Shares, and therefore, there will not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Accountant Proposal. 
Householding 
Mailings for multiple stockholders going to a single household are combined by delivering to that address, in a single envelope, a copy of the documents (annual reports, proxy statements, etc.) or other communications for all stockholders who have consented or are deemed to have consented to receiving such communications in such manner in accordance with the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the   "SEC"). If you do not want to continue to receive combined mailings of Company communications and would prefer to receive separate mailings of Company communications, please contact the Company's transfer agent, DST Systems, Inc. by telephone at (877) 628-8575 or by mail to FS Investment Corporation IV, c/o DST Systems, Inc., 430 W. 7th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105-1594. 
Voting 
You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy in accordance with the instructions provided below. You may also authorize a proxy by telephone or through the Internet using the toll-free telephone number or web address printed on your proxy card. Authorizing a proxy by telephone or through the Internet requires you to input the control number located on your proxy card. After inputting the control number, you will be prompted to direct your proxy to vote on each proposal. You will have an opportunity to review your directions and make any necessary changes before submitting your directions and terminating the telephone call or Internet link. Stockholders of the Company are entitled to one vote for each Share held. 
When voting by proxy and mailing your proxy card, you are required to:

The proxy statement and the Annual Report are also available on the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com/investments/funds/fsic-iv.

Other Information Regarding This Solicitation 
The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, proxy card and Annual Report. The Company has requested that brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons holding Shares in their names, or in the name of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, forward the proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners. The Company will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing. 
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited in person and by telephone or facsimile transmission by directors, officers or regular employees of the Company and its affiliates (without special compensation therefor). The Company has also retained Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of approximately $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses. Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by notice from the person giving the proxy at any time before it is exercised. Any such notice of revocation should be provided in writing and signed by the stockholder in the same manner as the proxy being revoked and delivered to the Company's proxy tabulator.  Security Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners 
The following table sets forth, as of October 10, 2018, the beneficial ownership of the director nominees, the Company's executive officers and directors, each person known to the Company to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding Shares, and all of the Company's executive officers and directors as a group. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and includes voting or investment power with respect to the Shares. There are no Shares subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 10, 2018.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's directors and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of its Shares, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based on the Company's review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons and information provided by the Company's directors and officers, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons were timely filed.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company are being asked to consider the election of the eleven nominees named below. Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the number of directors on the Board may not be fewer than the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law, which is one, or greater than twelve. Directors of the Company are elected annually for a term of one year, and serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board is currently comprised of nine directors. 
Each director nominee named below has been nominated for election by the Board to serve a one-year term until the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified: (i) Barbara Adams, (ii) Frederick Arnold, (iii) Todd Builione, (iv) Brian R. Ford, (v) Michael C. Forman, (vi) Richard Goldstein, (vii) Michael J. Hagan, (viii) Jeffrey K. Harrow, (ix) Jerel A. Hopkins, (x) James H. Kropp and (xi) Joseph P. Ujobai. 
Each director nominee has agreed to serve as a director if elected and has consented to being named as a nominee. No person being nominated as a director is being proposed for election pursuant to any agreement or understanding between such person and the Company. 
A stockholder can vote for, or withhold his or her vote from, any or all of the director nominees. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote such proxy FOR the election of each of the director nominees named above. If any of the director nominees should decline or be unable to serve as a director, the persons named as proxies will vote for such other nominee as may be proposed by the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the persons named as director nominees will be unwilling or unable to serve. 
Information about the Board and Director Nominees 
The role of the Board is to provide general oversight of the Company's business affairs and to exercise all of the Company's powers except those reserved for the stockholders. The responsibilities of the Board also include, among other things, the oversight of the Company's investment activities, the quarterly valuation of the Company's assets, oversight of the Company's financing arrangements and corporate governance activities. 
A majority of the members of the Board are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Company or FS/KKR Advisor, LLC, the Company's investment adviser (the "Advisor"), and are "independent" as defined by Rule 303A.00 in the NYSE Listed Company Manual. These individuals are referred to as the Company's independent directors (the "Independent Directors"). Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act defines an "interested person" to include, among other things, any person who has, or within the last two years had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company. The members of the Board who are not Independent Directors are referred to as interested directors (the "Interested Directors"). 
The Board is currently comprised of eight directors, six of whom are Independent Directors. Messrs. D'Alessio, Lederman, Rose, Sommer and Stuart and Ms. Fouss have not been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting. The Board has determined that the following directors and director nominees are, or if applicable, will be, Independent Directors: Ms. Adams, Ms. Fouss and Messrs. Arnold, D'Alessio, Ford, Goldstein, Hagan, Harrow, Hopkins, Kropp, Lederman, Rost, Sommer, Stuart and Ujobai. Based upon information requested from each director nominee concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, the Board has affirmatively determined that none of the Independent Director nominees has, or within the last two years had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company, other than, if applicable, in his or her capacity as a member of the Board or any Board committee or as a stockholder. If each of the director nominees is elected, the Board will be comprised of eleven directors, nine of whom will be Independent Directors.  In considering each director nominee and the composition of the Board as a whole, the Board seeks a diverse group of experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills, including diversity in gender, ethnicity and race, that the Board believes enables a director to make a significant contribution to the Board, the Company and its stockholders. These experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills, which are more fully described below, include, but are not limited to, management experience, independence, financial expertise and experience serving as directors or trustees of other entities. The Board may also consider such other experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills as it deems appropriate, given the then-current needs of the Board and the Company. 
These experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills relate directly to the management and operations of the Company. Success in each of these categories is a key factor in the Company's overall operational success and creating stockholder value. The Board believes that directors who possess these experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills are better able to provide oversight of the Company's management and the Company's long-term and strategic objectives. Below is a description of the experience, characteristics, attributes and skills of each director nominee that led the Board to conclude that each such person should serve as a director. The Board also considered the specific experience described in each director nominee's biographical information, as disclosed below.  The following tables set forth certain information regarding the Independent Director nominees, Interested Director nominees and the Independent Directors who are not nominees.

Risk Oversight and Board Structure 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Through its direct oversight role, and indirectly through its committees, the Board performs a risk oversight function for the Company consisting of, among other things, the following activities: (1) at regular and special Board meetings, and on an ad hoc basis, as needed, receiving and reviewing reports related to the performance and operations of the Company; (2) reviewing and approving, as applicable, the compliance policies and procedures of the Company; (3) reviewing investment strategies, techniques and the processes used to manage related risks; (4) overseeing the Company's investment valuation process through the Board's Valuation Committee that operates pursuant to authority assigned to it by the Board; (5) meeting with representatives of, or reviewing reports prepared by or with respect to, key service providers, including the investment adviser, administrator, distributor, transfer agent, custodian and independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, to review and discuss the activities of the Company and to provide direction with respect thereto; (6) reviewing periodically, and at least annually, the Company's fidelity bond, directors and officers, and errors and omissions insurance policies and such other insurance policies as may be appropriate; and (7) overseeing the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, including supervision of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that they provide timely analyses of significant financial reporting and internal control issues. 
The Board also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of the Company's Chief Compliance Officer. The Board receives a quarterly report from the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports on, among other things, the Company's compliance with applicable securities laws and its internal compliance policies and procedures. In addition, the Company's Chief Compliance Officer prepares a written report annually evaluating, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers. The Chief Compliance Officer report, which is reviewed by the Board, addresses at a minimum: (1) the operation and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers since the last report; (2) any material changes to such policies and procedures since the last report; (3) any recommendations for changes to such policies and procedures as a result of the Chief Compliance Officer's annual review; and (4) any material compliance matters that have occurred since the date of the last report about which the Board would reasonably need to know to oversee the Company's compliance activities and risks. The Chief Compliance Officer also meets separately in executive session with the Independent Directors at least once each year. In addition to compliance reports from the Company's Chief Compliance Officer, the Board also receives reports from legal counsel to the Company regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. 
Board Composition and Leadership Structure 
Mr. Forman, who is an "interested person" of the Company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that Mr. Forman, as co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is the director with the most knowledge of the Company's business strategy and is best situated to serve as Chairman of the Board. The Charter, as well as regulations governing BDCs generally, requires that a majority of the Board be persons other than "interested persons" of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
While the Company currently does not have a policy mandating a lead Independent Director, the Board believes that having an Independent Director fill the lead director role is appropriate. On March 8, 2017, the   Board appointed Mr. Stuart as lead Independent Director. The lead Independent Director, among other things, works with the Chairman of the Board in the preparation of the agenda for each Board meeting and in determining the need for special meetings of the Board, chairs any meeting of the Independent Directors in executive session, facilitates communications between other members of the Board and the Chairman of the Board and/or the Chief Executive Officer and otherwise consults with the Chairman of the Board and/or the Chief Executive Officer on matters relating to corporate governance and Board performance. 
The Board has concluded that its structure is appropriate given the current size and complexity of the Company and the extensive regulation to which the Company is subject as a BDC. 
Board Meetings and Attendance 
The Board met twenty-seven times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, including four regular quarterly meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board to which they were invited during 2017, with the exception of Mr. Gravina. The Company does not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at an annual meeting of stockholders. None of the directors attended the Company's 2017 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board has established three standing committees of the Board, which consist of an Audit Committee, a Valuation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
The Board has not established a standing compensation committee because the executive officers of the Company do not receive any direct compensation from the Company. The Board, as a whole, participates in the consideration of director compensation and decisions on director compensation are based on, among other things, a review of data of comparable BDCs. The Board may also engage compensation consultants from time-to-time, following consideration of certain factors related to such consultants' independence. 
Audit Committee 
The Board has established an Audit Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and consists of three members, including a Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee members are Messrs. Lederman (Chairman), D'Alessio and Stuart, each an Independent Director. The Board has determined that Mr. Lederman is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to oversee the integrity of the Company's accounting policies, financial reporting process and system of internal controls regarding finance and accounting policies. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting, engaging and discharging the Company's independent accountants, reviewing the plans, scope and results of the audit engagement with the Company's independent accountants, approving professional services provided by the Company's independent accountants (including compensation therefor) and reviewing the independence of the Company's independent accountants. The Audit Committee held six meetings during 2017. Each member of the Audit Committee attended at least 75% of the meetings held during 2017. The Audit Committee charter can be accessed via the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com/support/articles/corporate-governance-fsiciv. 
Valuation Committee 
The Board has established a Valuation Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and the authority assigned to it by the Board and consists of three members, including a Chair of the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee members are Ms. Fouss (Chair) and Messrs. Lederman and Stuart. The primary function of the Valuation Committee is to establish guidelines and make recommendations to the Board on matters relating to the valuation of the Company's investments. The Valuation Committee held four meetings during 2017. Each member of the Valuation Committee attended at least 75% of the meetings held during 2017.  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Board has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and consists of two members, including a Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members are Messrs. Sommer and Rost. The primary function of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to consider and make recommendations to the Board regarding certain governance matters, including selection of directors for election by stockholders, selection of director nominees to fill vacancies on the Board or a committee thereof, development and revision, as appropriate, of applicable corporate governance documentation and practices and oversight of the evaluation of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings during 2017. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee attended all of the meetings held during 2017, with the exception of Mr. Sommer. 
When nominating director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate in accordance with its charter. Among the qualifications considered in the selection of candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following attributes and criteria of candidates: experience, including experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, skills, expertise, diversity, including diversity of gender, race and national origin, personal and professional integrity, time availability in light of other commitments, conflicts of interest and such other relevant factors that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers appropriate in the context of the needs of the Board, including, when applicable, to enhance the ability of the Board or committees of the Board to fulfill their duties and/or to satisfy any independence or other applicable requirements imposed by law, rule, regulation or listing standard including, but not limited to, the 1940 Act and rules promulgated by the SEC. Each of the director nominees was approved by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the entire Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as the Company's management and stockholders. A stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board must provide notice to the Secretary of the Company in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws, which are described in greater detail under the heading "Submission of Stockholder Proposals." Nominees for director who are recommended by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as any other nominee for director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter can be accessed via the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com/support/articles/corporate-governance-fsiciv.

Interested parties may send communications to the Board or to any particular director to the following address: c/o FS Investment Corporation IV, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Company's executive officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company. The Company does not currently have any employees and does not expect to have any employees. As an externally managed BDC, services necessary for the Company's business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Advisor or its affiliates or by individuals who were contracted by the Company, the Advisor or their respective affiliates to work on behalf of the Company, pursuant to the terms of the investment advisory and administrative services agreement between the Company and the Advisor, dated April 9, 2018 (the "FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement"). Each of the Company's executive officers is an employee of the Advisor or its   affiliates or an outside contractor, and the day-to-day investment operations and administration of the Company's portfolio are managed by the Advisor. In addition, the Company will reimburse the Advisor for the Company's allocable portion of expenses incurred by the Advisor in performing its obligations under the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement. Historically, the Company reimbursed FSIC IV Advisor, LLC ("FSIC IV Advisor"), pursuant to an amended and restated investment advisory and administrative services agreement between the Company and FSIC IV Advisor, dated September 21, 2015 (the "FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement"). The FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement was replaced by the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement. 
Director Compensation 
The Company does not pay compensation to its directors who also serve in an executive officer capacity for the Company or the Advisor. 
Directors who do not also serve in an executive officer capacity for the Company or the Advisor are entitled to receive annual cash retainer fees, fees for participating in quarterly Board and Board committee meetings and certain other Board and Board committee meetings and annual fees for serving as committee chairpersons, determined based on the Company's net assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter. These directors are Messrs. D'Alessio, Lederman, Rost, Sommer and Stuart and Ms. Fouss. Mr. Stuart also receives an annual retainer for his service as lead Independent Director.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions (dollar amounts in thousands, excluding per share amounts, unless otherwise noted) 
The Company has procedures in place for the review, approval and monitoring of transactions involving the Company and certain persons related to the Company. For example, the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics generally prohibits any employee, officer or director from engaging in any transaction where there is a conflict between such individual's personal interest and the interests of the Company. Waivers to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for any executive officer or member of the Board must be approved by the Board and are publicly disclosed as required by applicable law and regulations. In addition, the Audit Committee is required to review and approve all transactions with related persons (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act). Prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event (which could include (1) a listing of the Company's Shares on a national securities exchange, (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation or (3) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board in which the Company's stockholders likely will receive cash or shares of a publicly-traded company), all future transactions with affiliates of the Company will be on terms no less favorable than could be obtained from an unaffiliated third party and must be approved by a majority of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors. 
Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager 
Historically, the Company received investment advisory and administrative services from FSIC IV Advisor pursuant to the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement. The FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement was replaced by the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement. FSIC IV Advisor previously engaged GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC ("GDFM") to act as the Company's investment sub-adviser pursuant to the investment sub-advisory agreement between FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM, dated September 21, 2015 (the "GDFM sub-advisory agreement"). GDFM resigned as the Company's investment sub-adviser and terminated the investment sub-advisory agreement effective April 9, 2018. 
Pursuant to the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets   (equal to the total assets set forth on the Company's consolidated financial statements) and an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter. 
The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company's "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, equal to 1.75% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 7.0%. For purposes of the subordinated incentive fee on income, "adjusted capital" means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company's Shares (including proceeds from the Company's distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program. As a result, the Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75%. Once the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, the Advisor will be entitled to a "catch-up" fee equal to the amount of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.1875%, or 8.75% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, the Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
The second part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on capital gains, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement). This fee equals 20.0% of the Company's incentive fee capital gains, which equals the Company's realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. The Company accrues for the incentive fee on capital gains, which, if earned, is paid annually. The Company accrues the incentive fees on capital gains based on net realized and unrealized gains; however, under the terms of the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the fee payable to the Advisor is based on realized gains and no such fee is payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. 
Pursuant to the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities and other administrative services. The Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. Pursuant to the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Company reimburses the Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) the Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. The Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics consistent with past practice (but solely to the extent such past practice is not inconsistent with the policies of the Advisor). The Company does not reimburse the Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of the Advisor. 
Historically, pursuant to the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, FSIC IV Advisor was entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of the   Company's gross assets and an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. Pursuant to the GDFM sub-advisory agreement, GDFM was entitled to receive 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FSIC IV Advisor under the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement with respect to each year. Effective February 1, 2017, FSIC IV Advisor contractually agreed to permanently waive 0.25% of its base management fee to which it was entitled under the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, so that the fee received equaled 1.75% of the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets. 
The Company also reimbursed FSIC IV Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations, including FSIC IV Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments, the Company's sponsor and an affiliate of FSIC IV Advisor, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FSIC IV Advisor. The amount of this reimbursement for FSIC IV Advisor was set at the lesser of (1) FSIC IV Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimated it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FSIC IV Advisor allocated the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. 
Also under the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the Company, either directly or through reimbursement to FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliates, was responsible for its organization and offering costs in an amount up to 0.75% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's continuous public offering. Organization and offering costs primarily included legal, accounting, printing and other expenses relating to the Company's continuous public offering, including costs associated with technology integration between the Company's systems and those of its selected broker-dealers, marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor's personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in registering and marketing the Shares, which included the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company. Prior to satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and for a period of time thereafter, FS Investments funded the Company's organization and offering costs. Following this period, the Company has paid certain of its organization and offering costs directly and reimbursed FSIC IV Advisor for offering costs incurred by FSIC IV Advisor on the Company's behalf, including marketing expenses, with respect to salaries and other direct expenses of FSIC IV Advisor's personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Shares. On January 6, 2016, the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement became effective upon satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement, and FSIC IV Advisor became entitled to receive up to 0.75% of the gross proceeds raised in the Company's continuous public offering until all organization and offering costs incurred have been recovered. As the Company reimburses FSIC IV Advisor for such costs, organization costs are charged to expense and offering costs are deferred and amortized to expense over twelve months. 
FS Investments funded certain of the Company's organization and offering costs in the amounts of $2,804 and $6,871, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) to December 31, 2016. Under the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, there was no liability on the Company's part for the organization and offering costs funded by FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliates (including FS Investments) until the Company satisfied the minimum offering requirement on January 6, 2016. Since commencing its continuous public offering and through December 31, 2017, the Company has paid total reimbursements of  $2,584 to FSIC IV Advisor and its affiliates for organization and offering costs funded by them. Following the closing of the Company's continuous public offering to new investors in November 2017, no amounts remain reimbursable to FS Investments and its affiliates under this arrangement. 
The dealer manager for the Company's continuous public offering was FS Investment Solutions, LLC ("FS Investment Solutions"), which is one of the Company's affiliates. Prior to the closing of the Company's   continuous public offering, the dealer manager was entitled under a second amended and restated dealer manager agreement, dated as of January 25, 2017, by and among the Company, FSIC IV Advisor and FS Investment Solutions, or the dealer manager agreement, to receive upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of Shares in the Company's continuous public offering, all or a portion of which could be re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The dealer manager reallowed to selected broker dealers and other financial representatives the upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, as applicable, it was entitled to receive during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, unless otherwise noted in the table below. The dealer manager agreement terminated in connection with the closing of the Company's continuous public offering in November 2017. 
Shares of Class T common stock are subject to annual distribution fees of 1.00% of the estimated value of such shares, as determined in accordance with applicable rules of The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA. The annual distribution fees is paid by the Company to the dealer manager pursuant to a distribution plan adopted by the Company in compliance with Rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 under the 1940 Act, as if those rules applied to the Company. Among other requirements, such plan must be approved annually by a vote of the Company's board of directors, including the directors who are not "interested persons" as defined in the 1940 Act and have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of such plan or in any agreements related to such plan. 
Except for Class T shares purchased by the principal of FSIC IV Advisor, members of the Company's board of directors and other individuals and entities affiliated with FSIC IV Advisor and GDFM, or through investment advisors whose contracts for investment advisory and related services include a fixed or "wrap" fee or other asset-based fee arrangement, annual distribution fees are expected to be reallowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives, unless noted in the table below. The annual distribution fees are intended to compensate the dealer manager and its affiliates, selected broker-dealers and financial representatives for services rendered and expenses incurred in connection with the ongoing marketing, sale and distribution of such shares. 
The annual distribution fees accrues daily commencing upon the initial sale of shares of common stock in the Company's continuous public offering until an investor reaches the sales charge cap, as defined below. The accrual as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects amounts beginning with the initial sale of shares of common stock in the Company's continuous public offering through December 31, 2017. The annual distribution fees are payable with respect to all shares of Class T common stock, other than shares issued under the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The annual distribution fees will terminate for all Class T stockholders upon a liquidity event. In addition, the Company will stop paying the annual distribution fees with respect to any outstanding Class T share when the total underwriting compensation from the upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and annual distribution fees attributable to any share equals 7.25% of gross offering proceeds, or the sales charge cap. The sales charge cap applicable to certain shares, including shares sold prior to January 25, 2017, will be reduced by the amount of any upfront sales load that is waived for such shares or to otherwise account for any lower upfront sales load paid by an investor with respect to such shares. 
The annual distribution fees for all Class T shares currently will terminate upon the earliest of  (i) any Class T share purchased after January 25, 2017 reaching the applicable sales charge cap, (ii) the Company's dealer manager advising the Company that the aggregate underwriting compensation payable from all sources (determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules) would be in excess of 10% of the gross proceeds of this offering and (iii) a liquidity event. If, in the future, the Company receives exemptive relief to offer multiple share classes and if it offers a class of common stock with no sales load or asset-based service or annual distribution fee, or a No-Load Share Class, upon a Class T share reaching the applicable sales charge cap, such share will be converted into a share of such No-Load Share Class and will no longer be subject to ongoing annual distribution fees. 
The following table describes the fees and expenses the Company accrued under the FS/KKR Advisor investment advisory and administrative services agreement, the FSIC IV Advisor investment advisory and   administrative services agreement, amounts recouped by FS Investments under the FS Investments expense reimbursement agreement, as defined below, and fees that FS Investment Solutions received pursuant to the Company's distribution plan and share repurchase program during the six months ended June 30,2018 and 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

[END TABLE]
Expense Reimbursement 
Pursuant to an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement, dated as of April 9, 2018, by and between the Advisor and the Company, or the FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement, FS/KKR Advisor has agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of the Company's distributions to stockholders will be paid from its offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments the Company may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to the Company that are treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of the Company's distributions to stockholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital to the extent that the Company may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds to fund its distributions to stockholders. Under those circumstances, the Advisor will not reimburse the Company for the   portion of such distributions to stockholders that represent a return of capital, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to stockholders. 
Under the FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement, the Advisor will reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between the Company's cumulative distributions paid to its stockholders in each quarter, less the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts were not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each quarter. 
Pursuant to the FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation to reimburse the Advisor for any amounts funded by the Advisor under such agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which the Advisor funded such amount, the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the cumulative distributions paid by the Company to its stockholders during such quarter; provided, however, that (i) the Company will only reimburse the Advisor for expense support payments made by the Advisor with respect to any calendar quarter to the extent that the payment of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause "other operating expenses" (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by the Company during such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of the Company's average net assets attributable to shares of its common stock for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of the Company's average net assets attributable to shares of its common stock represented by "other operating expenses" during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from the Advisor was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from the Advisor made during the same fiscal year); and (ii) the Company will not reimburse the Advisor for expense support payments made by the Advisor for any calendar quarter if the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by the Company at the time of such reimbursement payment is less than the annualized rate of regular cash distributions declared by the Company at the time the Advisor made the expense support payment to which such reimbursement payment relates. The Company is not obligated to pay interest on the reimbursements it is required to make to the Advisor under the FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement. "Other operating expenses" means the Company's total "operating expenses" (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, annual distribution fees, organization and offering expenses, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. "Operating expenses" means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with GAAP for investment companies. 
The FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement replaced an amended and restated expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with FS Investments, or the FS Investments expense reimbursement agreement. The FS Investments expense reimbursement agreement had substantially similar terms to the FS/KKR Advisor expense reimbursement agreement. 
As of June 30, 2018, there were no unreimbursed expense support payments subject to future reimbursement by the Company. 
Exemptive Relief 
As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term.  In an order dated June 4, 2013 (the "FS Order"), the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FSIC IV Advisor, including FS Energy and Power Fund, FS Investment Corporation, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III and any future BDCs that are advised by FSIC IV Advisor or its affiliated investment advisers. However, in connection with the investment advisory relationship with the Advisor, and in an effort to mitigate potential future conflicts of interest, the Board authorized and directed that the Company (i) withdraw from the FS Order, except with respect to any transaction in which the Company participated in reliance on the FS Order prior to April 9, 2018, and (ii) rely on an exemptive relief order, dated April 3, 2018, that permits the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions, including investments originated and directly negotiated by the Advisor or KKR Credit, with certain affiliates of the Advisor. 
Potential Conflicts of Interest 
The members of the senior management and investment teams of the Advisor serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as the Company does, or of investment vehicles managed by the same personnel. For example, the Advisor is the investment adviser to the other funds in the Fund Complex, and the officers, managers and other personnel of the Advisor may serve in similar or other capacities for the investment advisers to future investment vehicles affiliated with FS Investments or KKR Credit. In serving in these multiple and other capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the Company's best interests or in the best interest of the Company's stockholders. The Company's investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of such investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. For example, the Company relies on the Advisor to manage its day-to-day activities and to implement its investment strategy. The Advisor, FS Investments, KKR Credit and certain of their affiliates are presently, and plan in the future to continue to be, involved with activities which are unrelated to the Company. As a result of these activities, the Advisor, FS Investments, KKR Credit, their employees and certain of their affiliates will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between the Company and other activities in which they are or may become involved, including the management of the other funds in the Fund Complex. 
The Advisor and its affiliates are simultaneously providing investment advisory services to other affiliated entities, including the other funds in the Fund Complex. The Advisor may determine that it is appropriate for the Company and one or more other investment accounts managed by the Advisor or any of its respective affiliates to participate in an investment opportunity. To the extent the Company is able to make co-investments with investment accounts managed by the Advisor or its respective affiliates, these co-investment opportunities may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among the Company and the other participating accounts. In addition, conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest may also arise in determining which investment opportunities should be presented to the Company and other participating accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, the Advisor will seek to execute such transactions on a fair and equitable basis and in accordance with its allocation policies, taking into account various factors, which may include: the source of origination of the investment opportunity; investment objectives and strategies; tax considerations; risk, diversification or investment concentration parameters; characteristics of the security; size of available investment; available liquidity and liquidity requirements; regulatory restrictions; and/or such other factors as may be relevant to a particular transaction. As affiliates of FS Investments and KKR Credit currently serve as the investment adviser to other entities and accounts, it is possible that some investment opportunities will be provided to such other entities and accounts rather than to the Company. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE 
DIRECTOR NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
RSM US LLP, 518 Township Line Road, Suite 300, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania 19422, has been appointed by the Board to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. RSM US LLP (formerly McGladrey LLP) acted as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the period from February 25, 2015 (Inception) through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of RSM US LLP in the Company. A representative of RSM US LLP will be available by telephone to answer questions during the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. 
Although action by the stockholders on this matter is not required, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it is appropriate to seek stockholder ratification of this selection in light of the role played by the independent registered public accounting firm in reporting on the Company's consolidated financial statements. If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the appointment of RSM US LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 is not ratified by the stockholders, the adverse vote will be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to appoint RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the succeeding fiscal year.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Company's Audit Committee reviews, negotiates and approves in advance the scope of work, any related engagement letter and the fees to be charged by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for audit services and permitted non-audit services for the Company and for permitted non-audit services for the Advisor and any affiliates thereof that provide services to the Company if such non-audit services have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Company. Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount of fees associated with such services, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is considered at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by RSM US LLP to management. All of the audit and permitted non-audit services described above for which RSM US LLP billed the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  Audit Committee Report 
As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with both management and RSM US LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company's consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Management advised the Audit Committee that all financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and reviewed significant accounting issues with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also discussed with RSM US LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as amended, and by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by RSM US LLP. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and non-audit services performed by RSM US LLP in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the firm's independence. 
Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount of fees associated with such services, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by RSM US LLP to management. 
The Audit Committee received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM US LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding RSM US LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with RSM US LLP its independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the audit fees paid by the Company to RSM US LLP. It has also reviewed non-audit services and fees to assure compliance with the Company's and the Audit Committee's policies restricting RSM US LLP from performing services that might impair its independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.
