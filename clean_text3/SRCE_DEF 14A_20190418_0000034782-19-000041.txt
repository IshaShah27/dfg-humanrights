1st SOURCE CORPORATION
P.O. Box 1602● South Bend, Indiana 46634
PROXY STATEMENT
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of 1st Source Corporation ("1st Source" or "the Company").
When and where is the Annual Meeting? April 18, 2019, at 4:30 p.m. local time, at the 1st Source Center, 100 North Michigan Street, 4th Floor Boardroom, South Bend, Indiana 46601. Entrance to the Annual Meeting is limited to shareholders only. If your shares are held in "street name" (that is, through a broker), you must bring a recent copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of February 15, 2019, the record date.
Who may vote at the meeting? Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2019, will be eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting. If shares are held in "street name", shareholders must obtain a legal proxy from their broker to vote in person. 
Why did I receive a notice regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of paper copies of the proxy materials? We are using the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our shareholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder. As a result, beginning on or about March 8, 2019, we sent our shareholders (other than those who had previously requested to receive only printed copies of our proxy materials) by mail or email a notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and vote online. This notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you received a notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the notice or on the website referred to in the notice.
If I am the record holder of my shares, how do I vote? You may vote by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Internet:  Go to www.proxyvote.com to transmit your voting instructions. 
• Telephone:  Use any touch-tone telephone to call 1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions to transmit your voting instructions. 
• Mail:  Mark, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided. 
• Voting in person at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Although you may vote by mail, we ask that you vote instead by Internet or telephone, which saves us postage and processing costs.
If you are a beneficial owner and a broker or other fiduciary is the record holder, then you received access to these proxy materials from the record holder. The record holder should have given you instructions for directing how the record holder should vote your shares. It will then be the record holder's responsibility to vote your shares for you in the manner you direct.
How many shares are outstanding? There were 26,570,971 shares of our common stock outstanding on the record date. The voting securities of 1st Source consist only of Common Stock. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share. Cumulative voting is not authorized.
What is the required vote? Director nominees will be elected upon receipt of a majority of the votes cast in the election at the Annual Meeting. Ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors will be approved if the votes cast in favor exceed those cast against. The Company knows of no other proposals expected to be presented at the meeting other than the two proposals described herein. Additional proposals, if any, would be approved if votes in favor of such proposal exceed those cast against.
How are abstentions and "non-votes" counted? Abstentions on properly executed proxy cards and shares not voted by brokers and other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners ("broker non-votes") will be counted for determining a quorum at the meeting. However, abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the voting results on those matters for which the shareholder has abstained or the broker has not voted.
Who is soliciting proxies? This solicitation is being made by the Board of Directors of 1st Source. The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by 1st Source. 
How will proxies be solicited? In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited through personal interview, electronic media, telephone, and facsimile by directors, officers and regular employees of 1st Source without additional remuneration therefor.
How may I revoke my proxy? Shareholders may revoke their proxies at any time prior to the meeting by giving written notice to John B. Griffith, Secretary, 1st Source Corporation, Post Office Box 1602, South Bend, Indiana 46634, or by voting in person at the meeting. If you hold your shares in the name of your broker or other fiduciary and desire to change your instructions on how to vote your shares, you will need to contact that party.
When were these materials provided? The approximate date for making available this Proxy Statement and the form of proxy to shareholders is March 8, 2019. VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF

Abstentions and shares not voted by brokers are not considered "votes cast".
The following information is submitted for each nominee as well as each director and each non-director executive officer continuing in office.

 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
The Audit Committee of 1st Source's Board of Directors is responsible, under the terms of that Committee's charter, for reviewing and disclosure of related party transactions that are material to 1st Source's consolidated financial statements or otherwise require disclosure under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K.
Banking Transactions — Directors and officers of 1st Source and their affiliates were customers of, and had transactions with, 1st Source and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business during 2018. Such transactions were in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additional transactions are expected to take place in the ordinary course of business in the future. All outstanding loans and commitments were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Company and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability, or present other features unfavorable to the Company. Credit underwriting procedures followed were no less stringent than those for comparable transactions with borrowers not related to the Company.
1st Source's Loan Policy requires prior approval by a majority of the Board of Directors of any extension of credit to an executive officer, director, principal shareholder or persons related to any of the foregoing if aggregate extensions of credit to such executive officer, director, principal shareholder or other person exceeds $500,000. The aggregate of loans to an executive officer may not exceed $100,000 excluding loans 1) to finance the education of the executive officer's children, 2) to purchase, construct, maintain or improve a residence owned by the executive officer and secured by a first lien, or 3) secured by a perfected security interest in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness or other obligations fully guaranteed by the United States, cash or a cash-equivalent. Loans to executive officers are 1) reported to the 1st Source Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting, 2) preceded by the submission of a current personal financial statement, and 3) made subject to the condition that the loan will become due if the executive officer becomes indebted to any other financial institution or financial institutions in an aggregate amount greater than $100,000 (excluding the types of loans noted in 1), 2) and 3) in the preceding sentence). Finally, within 10 days of the date that the aggregate indebtedness to other financial institutions exceeds $100,000 (again excluding the types of loans noted in 1), 2) and 3) above), an executive officer must make a written report to the Board disclosing same.

BOARD COMMITTEES AND OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
In January 2004, the Board of Directors adopted and has since periodically updated the 1st Source Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are designed to ensure and document the Company's high standards for corporate governance. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are in accordance with the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and rules of the SEC. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Company's website at www.1stsource.com.
Director Independence — The Board assesses each director's independence in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Guidelines define an independent director as one who has no relationship to the Company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out responsibilities as a director of the Company and who is otherwise "independent" under the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board has determined, after careful review, that the following nine of the eleven current members of the Board are independent directors: Ms. Birmingham-Byrd, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Ms. Hershman, Mr. Khan, Mr. Khilnani, Mr. Martin, Mr. Ozark, Mr. Phair and Mr. Schwabero. Board Committees — 1st Source and 1st Source Bank share the following permanent committees made up of board members of both organizations. Executive, Governance and Nominating, Audit, and Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee members are appointed annually after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Current member composition of these committees is as follows:

Board Leadership Structure — Under 1st Source's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the Board's leadership structure, including whether one individual should serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and whether the Board should have a Lead Director. The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the structure of the Board on at least an annual basis and monitors and makes recommendations to the Board on an ongoing basis on other matters concerning Board policies and corporate governance. Additionally, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board reviews the performance of the Chief Executive Officer on an annual basis. The Board believes it is in the best interest of 1st Source to have Mr. Murphy serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The reasons for this include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Murphy's past performance in both roles and his continuing ability to serve in both; 
• The need for decisive leadership and clear accountability in facing 1st Source's challenges and opportunities;  
• Mr. Murphy's extensive specialized knowledge regarding those challenges and opportunities as well as his large ownership position; 
• The composition of the Board includes a majority of independent directors, providing an appropriate amount of independent board oversight; and 
• The Board has an independent Lead Director. 
[END TABLE]
The incumbent chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee, Mr. Ozark, presently serves as the Lead Director under the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Lead Director will normally chair any meetings of the Board at which the Chairman or Vice Chairman (if there is one) of the Board is not present or from which, for whatever reason, each has recused himself. The Lead Director has the power to call meetings of the Board of Directors and to set agendas for meetings. The Lead Director also chairs the executive sessions of the independent directors, which occurred five times in 2018.
Board Role in Risk Oversight — The Board exercises oversight of the risk management of 1st Source through the functions of its committees as described above. Additionally, the Board receives quarterly reports from the Strategic Deployment Committee, an executive-level management committee chaired by Mr. Murphy that, among other things, oversees and evaluates risks, controls and the risk management processes for 1st Source and 1st Source Bank.
Meetings of the Board of Directors and Directors' Compensation — The Board of Directors held 6 meetings in 2018. The only incumbent director attending fewer than 75% of the aggregate total meetings of the Board of Directors and all committees of the Board of 1st Source on which he or she served was Lisa Hershman. Ms. Hershman missed meetings in 2018 due to her public service employment commitments with the Department of Defense. As a result of her public service, Ms. Hershman is not able to accept compensation for her service on the Board. The Board appreciates her service to her country and believes she is gaining valuable experience which will benefit the Company and its shareholders when her tour of duty there ends. Thereafter, she should be able to attend all meetings and accept compensation.

Ten of eleven members of the Board at the time of the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders attended that meeting. Code of Ethical Conduct — The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct for Financial Managers, which is available on the Company's website at www.1stsource.com. The Code of Ethical Conduct for Financial Managers constitutes a code of ethics as defined in Section 406(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and applies to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and other individuals performing similar accounting or financial reporting functions for the Company.
Shareholder Communications — Communications to the Board of Directors from shareholders are welcomed. All written communications may be submitted through the Company's website at www.1stsource.com, by e-mail at shareholder@1stsource.com, or by U.S. mail at 1st Source Corporation, 100 North Michigan Street, South Bend, Indiana, 46601, Attn: Chairman, Governance and Nominating Committee, or Attn: Corporate Secretary. The recipient of any such communication shall share it with the Chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee who shall either (i) relay it to the full Board or an appropriate committee chairperson, or (ii) where he feels that the communication is not appropriate to relay to the Board, provide a copy of the communication and an indication of his proposed disposition to the General Counsel, or another independent director, either of whom may forward the communication to any other directors if he or she deems it prudent or appropriate to do so. The Chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee shall forward all recommendations for Board nominees submitted by shareholders to the members of the Committee.
GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE INFORMATION
The Board of Directors formed an independent Governance and Nominating Committee in January 2004. The charter of the Governance and Nominating Committee was amended in October 2014 to reflect its additional governance responsibilities and is available at www.1stsource.com. See also the description of the Committee under "Board Committees and Other Governance Matters" above. All members of the Governance and Nominating Committee (see "Board Committees" above) comply with the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules. One of the purposes of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to identify, evaluate, recruit and select qualified candidates for election, re-election or appointment to the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee may use multiple sources for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors, including referrals from current directors and executive officers and recommendations by shareholders. Candidates recommended by shareholders will be evaluated in the same manner as candidates identified by any other source except that the Governance and Nominating Committee also may consider the number of shares held and the length of time the shareholder-recommended candidate has invested in the Company. In order to give the Governance and Nominating Committee adequate time to evaluate recommended director candidates, shareholder recommendations should be submitted in writing at least 120 days prior to the next Annual Meeting to be held on or before April 23, 2020. Nominations should be addressed to the attention of the Chairman, Governance and Nominating Committee, c/o 1st Source Corporation.
The Governance and Nominating Committee will select new or incumbent nominees or recommend to the Board replacement nominees considering the following criteria:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualifications, including judgment, skill, capability, conflicts of interest, business experience and technical/professional/educational background; 
• Personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and reputation in the business community; 
• Whether the nominee currently lives in one of the Company's markets; 
• Current knowledge and contacts in the communities or industries in which the Company does business; 
• Current knowledge in one or more of the Company's lines of business; 
• Ability and willingness to commit adequate time, or in the case of incumbent directors, past participation and contribution, to Board and committee matters; 
• Whether the nominee's knowledge and experience is complementary to, or duplicative of, that of the other members of the Board; 
• If applicable, whether the nominee would be deemed "independent" under listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules; 
• Whether the nominee is qualified and likely to remain qualified to serve under the Company's By-laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines; 
• Diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and other demographics;  
• Whether the nominee is under the age of 72; and 
• Such other factors the Committee deems relevant. 
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Nominating Committee assesses its own performance, including its effectiveness in achieving a diverse Board, and reviews its charter and recommends any proposed changes every other year coincident with the bi-annual self-assessment of the full Board.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee oversees 1st Source's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors, retains and oversees the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and oversees the Company's compliance with ethics policies and the Company's management of legal, regulatory and other operational risks. The Board of Directors has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee to set forth its authority and responsibilities. All of the members of the Committee are independent as defined in the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules and also qualify as audit committee financial experts, as defined in the rules of the SEC.
The Committee reviewed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report with management. The Committee also reviewed the financial statements with 1st Source's independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Committee also considered, with the independent registered public accounting firm, the firm's judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of 1st Source's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communication with Audit Committees." In addition, the Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's independence from management and 1st Source, including the matters in the written disclosures required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence", and considered the compatibility of non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to 1st Source with the firm's independence.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. Audit Committee

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Compensation Oversight
The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, comprised entirely of independent directors, administers the Company's executive compensation program. The responsibilities of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee are described in its charter and include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determine compensation for Named Executive Officers (the executives required by SEC rules to be named in this proxy statement, or "NEOs") and review and approve recommendations of executive management for other senior management personnel; 
• Review performance of the Chief Executive Officer; 
• Oversee and approve establishment and administration of wage and benefit policies for the Company including an annual salary and performance grid for all employees; 
• Review general human resources guidelines, policies and procedures; 
• Oversee the Company's stock and benefit plans;  
• Review incentive plans and attest that they do not encourage inappropriate risk taking; and 
• Conduct an annual self-assessment. 
[END TABLE]
The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee determines the compensation for NEOs and reviews and either adjusts or approves it for other senior management personnel based on executive management's recommendations after reviewing the Company's performance against its annual operating plan and its intermediate and long-term tactical and strategic plans. The Committee also reviews market data and peer and industry information periodically and considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer with regard to cash and stock incentives under the Company's Executive Incentive Plan and the other incentive plans for officers in the Company as described below.
The Committee also periodically engages outside consultants to review the Company's compensation programs and underlying data to ensure they are competitive and reflect market realities, and to provide advice with regards to determining compensation for NEOs and other senior management personnel. The Committee engaged Blanchard Consulting Group in December 2015 for this purpose. It did so after considering the independence factors for compensation consultants outlined in the NASDAQ Listing Rules and determining that Blanchard was independent. The Committee's engagement of Blanchard is described further below.
Compensation Philosophy and Program
The Company's compensation philosophy rests on the core principle that its executive officers and key employees are all in partnership with each other and with the Company's shareholders to achieve success over the long-term. Guided by this core principle, the Company's compensation program can be summarized as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company succeeds best over the long-term when the executive officers and key employees are motivated to work together in this partnership as long-term owners themselves. The Company's compensation program is designed to compensate executive officers and key employees fairly and continuously reinforce a partnership of long-term owners. 
• The program is designed to encourage consistent high-level performance with particular emphasis on building long-term customer relationships. The Company believes that a strategic focus on building deep, long-term customer relationships is the foundation for strong, high quality, sustainable, long-term performance. Increasing such relationships over the long-term optimizes shareholder value through growth of high quality net revenues.  
• The program is based on pay-for-performance with performance evaluated relative to both internal business plans, and tactical and strategic objectives and to the results of the Company compared with its relevant peer groups. 
• The program provides competitive compensation opportunities that are consistent with practices of our peers with adjustments made for individual variance in skill and contribution. 
• The program is designed to encourage a measured approach to growth that includes necessary attention to understanding and managing the risks of the business.  
• The program rewards growth of customer relationships and sound risk management through compensation that is balanced between base salaries and performance-based incentive compensation.  
• The program's incentive compensation is also balanced between cash bonuses and equity awards, with both linked to the Company's overall performance on a short-term, intermediate-term and long-term basis. 
[END TABLE]
 The program also promotes long-term share ownership, with all executive officers expected to maintain a significant investment in the Company and meet stock ownership guidelines.
Company Performance
The Committee evaluated the Company's 2018 performance during early 2019. The Company generally met its quantitative and qualitative objectives for 2018. Highlights included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company achieved record net income of $82.41 million in 2018. This was a 21.1% increase from 2017. 
• The Company earned $3.16 per share which was a 21.5% increase from 2017. 
• The Company achieved a return on average assets of 1.34%. This placed it in the top 34% of all publicly-traded $3 to $10 billion peer companies. 
• The Company grew its average loans outstanding to $4.76 billion, a 9.7% growth over the prior year, and increased its year-end loans outstanding to $4.84 billion, a 6.8% growth over 2017. 
• The Company had net loan losses of 0.29% of average net loans and leases outstanding. 
• The Company ended the year with a nonperforming assets ratio of 0.71% and a reserve for loan and lease losses of 2.08%. 
• The Company continued to exceed the new minimum Well Capitalized requirements on a fully phased-in basis. 
• The Company opened one new banking center and one stand-alone ATM, and remodeled three other banking centers largely on time and on budget. 
• The Company maintained its #1 deposit share in its 15 contiguous county market. 
• The Company continued development of succession management in a variety of positions. 
• The Company continued 31 years of dividend increases. 
• The Company received the "Gold Level Award" for the Community Bank category for the sixth year in a row for delivering the greatest number of SBA loans in Indiana.

The Committee also compared the Company's total return over the past five years with the total return of the publicly-traded members of the In-Market, Midwest and National Commercial & Industrial Concentration Peer Groups as well as the group of publicly-traded banking companies in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin and all NASDAQ traded companies shown in the Annual Report:
* Assumes $100 invested on December 31, 2013 in 1st Source Corporation common stock, NASDAQ market index, banking companies in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and the In-Market, Midwest, and National Commercial & Industrial Concentration peer group.
** The Morningstar Weighted NASDAQ Index Return is calculated using all companies which trade as NASD Capital Markets, NASD Global Markets or NASD Global Select. It includes both domestic and foreign companies. The index is weighted by the then current shares outstanding and assumes dividends reinvested. The return is calculated on a monthly basis.
*** The peer group is a market-capitalization-weighted stock index of 37 banking companies in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The following companies included in this peer group in last year's proxy statement have not been included this year, all due to being acquired during 2018: First Federal of Northern Bancorp, Inc., Main Source Financial Group, Inc., and Northern States Financial Corp.
NOTE: Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends.
Compensation Consultants
As noted above, the Committee engaged Blanchard Consulting Group in late 2015 after interviewing a number of compensation consulting firms. The scope of Blanchard's engagement was to evaluate the Committee's processes and information, provide advice concerning the competitiveness of the Company's compensation for NEOs and other members of senior management and recommend improvements in compensation practices. In this regard, Blanchard performed the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Validated the process and information the Committee uses to evaluate base compensation and short and long term cash and equity incentives of the CEO and CFO as to their competitiveness and appropriateness. 
• Similarly collected and validated comparative data for the then next four highest paid officers. 
• Constructed the following peer comparison groups that in some cases included similar or the same companies that 1st Source traditionally includes in its peer groups: 
◦ A regional peer group of 20 banking companies with assets between $2 and $12 billion as of September 30, 2015 and headquartered in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, or Pennsylvania; 
◦ Blanchard's internal database of publicly traded banking companies with assets between $2 billion and $10 billion as of year-end 2014; 
◦ The publicly traded members of the "National Commercial & Industrial Concentration Peer Group" used by the Committee for assessing relative performance of the Company as noted in the tables above under "Company Performance"; and 
◦ Summarized data from other published banking and financial industry surveys, some of which currently are being used by 1st Source. 
[END TABLE]
 1st Source Bank participated in McLagan's Equipment & Finance Compensation Survey in 2016. The survey included over 70 banks, captives and independent leasing companies and benchmarked the Bank's Specialty Finance Group's officers' pay levels including salary, incentives, and total compensation against comparable market roles in 2015. The Bank also engaged McLagan to run an additional cut of the survey with a refined peer group selected by the Bank. The Committee has determined that McLagan is independent after considering the independence factors for compensation consultants outlined in the NASDAQ listing rules. 
Components of Compensation and 2018 Compensation Decisions
The following table summarizes the components of compensation the Company provides to its NEOs and other senior management personnel:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Component Frequency Criteria Form(s) of Payment Restrictions Term of Holding 
Salary Annual Qualifications, responsibilities and performance Cash None None 
Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) Annual Weighted corporate, group, division, unit and individual performance goals Cash and book value stock Book value stock subject to forfeiture over a five-year period based on employee remaining with the Company and the Company meeting EPS growth or ROA criteria Book value stock generally required to be held until retirement. Limited exceptions for up to 50% of stock beginning seven years following lapse of forfeiture period (eight to twelve years from date of grant) but subject to minimum stock ownership requirements 
Long-Term Executive Incentive Plan Every three years Weighted corporate financial goals for the third year of the three-year planning period and average of individual annual awards for the three-year planning period Cash and market value stock Market value stock subject to forfeiture over a five-year period based on employee remaining with the Company and the Company remaining profitable Subject to NEO accumulating required minimum stock holdings 
Strategic Deployment Incentive Plan Annual Company net income and Committee's determination of success of strategic initiatives embedded in Company's long-term plans using specific operating and financial metrics Cash and/or stock as the Committee determines Market value stock subject to forfeiture over a five-year period based on employee remaining with the Company and the Company remaining profitable Subject to NEO accumulating required minimum stock holdings 
1982 Restricted Stock Award Plan Discretionary Discretionary Market value stock Market value stock subject to forfeiture over a zero to ten-year period based on employee remaining with the Company and in some cases the attainment of individual, group or Company goals Subject to NEO accumulating required minimum stock holdings 
[END TABLE]
Each element of compensation is discussed in more detail below. The Committee reviews the salary and incentive history for each NEO.
Base Salaries
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Why we pay this component. 
[END TABLE]
Annual base salaries are designed to provide 1st Source executives with a basic level of cash compensation that is competitive in view of their qualifications, responsibilities and performance. Executive salaries are administered under the 1st Source Salary Administration Program applicable to all exempt employees. Through this program, each exempt job is graded under direction of the Human Resources Division and placed in a salary range with a midpoint targeted for the 50th percentile of the market range. Management monitors and re-calibrates the job grades and salary ranges by regularly evaluating market pay for particular positions as openings occur, as jobs change or as managers raise questions about the competitiveness of the pay for certain jobs. In addition, management periodically studies the competitiveness of its salary structure (ranges and job grades) by reference to market and industry information from a variety of sources, including Pearl Mayer, Compdata Surveys/Dolan Technologies Corporation and McLagan. As noted, in late 2015, the Committee sought validation and advice from Blanchard Consulting Group concerning management's processes and information for base salaries as well as total compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How we determine the amount. 
[END TABLE]
For the NEOs, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee annually evaluates base salaries and total compensation by reference to the same sources used for the Company's Salary Administration Program. It also reviews the public information available from proxy statements on compensation paid to NEOs of peer organizations. The Committee reviews information for the CEO, CFO and, to the extent peer information is available, other NEOs compared to its Midwest peer group (see list above under Company Performance), a nationwide peer group of banking companies with a concentration of commercial and industrial loans (see list above under Company Performance), a nationwide peer group of banking companies with $3 billion to $10 billion in assets, and a nationwide peer group of publicly traded banking companies of all sizes. The Committee uses the peer group data as a point of reference and one of several factors in setting base salaries and other components of compensation for the NEOs. If any component of compensation for the NEOs varies significantly from the median of those in our peer group, then the Committee considers the circumstances (e.g. tenure, experience, historical performance) and whether an adjustment to one or more components of compensation is warranted. In addition to the foregoing, the Committee reviewed the Blanchard data prior to awarding incentive compensation for 2015 under both the Executive Incentive Plan and the Strategic Deployment Incentive Plan. It took into account 1st Source's performance as compared to the Blanchard peer groups as well as the peer groups traditionally used by 1st Source. The Committee continued to reference these data sets as it approved base compensation changes in 2018 and awarded incentive compensation for 2018 for the named executive officers.
Increases to base salaries are considered annually. Management evaluates market conditions and proposes a salary performance grid that provides the range of authorized merit increases for each level of performance rating in each quadrant of the applicable salary ranges. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee reviews, adjusts and approves the proposed grid each year. All of the NEOs, including the Chief Executive Officer, are eligible to receive annual salary increases approved under the Salary Administration Program.
An exempt employee's base salary will increase based on his or her position in the salary range and individual performance rating determined through the annual performance review process. Performance ratings are based on a scale of 1 to 5 with a 3 rating representing performance that meets expectations.
The Committee applies the salary performance grid used for all exempt employees when determining base salary increases for Mr. Murphy and the other NEOs. The Committee evaluates Mr. Murphy's performance each year looking at, among other factors, the Company's return on assets, return on equity, its absolute earnings, and the overall performance of the Company relative to its annual budget plan and long-term strategic plan approved by the Board of Directors. His responsibilities also include representing the Company to its various constituencies, ensuring the Company's ongoing community engagement, and ensuring the development of a culture of client service, long-term financial performance, teamwork, corporate integrity, and long-term success. Based on Mr. Murphy's 2018 performance and the Company's performance against its annual profit plan and using the salary performance grid approved by the Committee for 2019, the Committee granted Mr. Murphy a 3.3% increase in base salary.
Mr. Murphy evaluates the performance of the other NEOs and makes recommendations for their annual increases to the Committee. The President of the Company, Mr. Seitz, also contributes to the evaluation of the other NEOs besides himself. The progression of increases in base salary for each of the NEOs is shown in the Summary Compensation Table below.
Annual Incentive Awards Under the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Why we pay this component. 
[END TABLE]
The EIP is designed to reward the NEOs and other participants for performance with a long-term emphasis. Annual incentive awards achieve this balance with payments of both cash and stock. The annual cash awards provide participants with immediate recognition of strong, annual performance. The Committee has discretion to approve a matching award equal to the full value of, or a portion of, the value of the cash award to be paid in the form of book value shares or market value shares. The Committee has generally made annual matching awards of 1/2 to 1/3 in book value stock to provide participants with the opportunity to build and increase the value of their ownership of 1st Source during the course of a long career with the Company. The value of this stock only grows if the Company continues to perform. Also, a long-term holding requirement for those shares further establishes alignment between the long-term benefit to the participants and the interests of our shareholders. The Company has chosen book value stock as the primary form of incentive stock because book value is the one value that members of management and sales and service personnel directly affect by their individual and collective actions. Earnings of the Company are either added to the book value per share or paid out as dividends on all outstanding shares (including book value shares whether or not still subject to forfeiture). In this way, book value more closely reflects the real economic value of the Company and is not subject to fluctuations in the stock market that are unrelated to the long-term performance of the Company. Inappropriate risk-taking is discouraged through the five year forfeiture period of book value share awards. Inappropriate risk-taking is further discouraged through restrictions on the sale of book value shares that, with limited exceptions, require recipients to hold the shares until retirement and then sell them back to the Company at the then book value, with the purchase price payable in installments over a five year period. The limited exceptions allow executives, subject to the Committee's approval, to sell back to the Company up to 50% of those book value shares for which the risk of forfeiture has been lapsed for seven or more years and only for the purchase of a personal residence or second home, college education tuition or financial hardship. The Company believes that equity-based compensation using book value stock under the EIP ties participants' economic incentives directly to the long-term, substantive and sustainable economic performance of the Company. It encourages them to make sound business decisions that will grow the Company carefully over time and strengthen its financial position and should discourage decisions designed only for short-term personal gain. This decision-making for the long-term is reinforced as these stock awards can become a significant portion of a participant's net worth over time.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How we determine the amount. 
[END TABLE]
Awards under the EIP are determined annually following the close of the fiscal year based on performance against a series of metrics selected and weighted for each participant at the beginning of the year. The EIP offers participants the potential for an annual cash award and a long-term stock award.
Annual Cash Awards: Each management participant under the EIP is assigned a "partnership level" percentage that is the starting point for determining his or her annual cash award. Partnership level percentages range from 4.25% to 15% of the salary range midpoint assigned by the Committee for purposes of computing the EIP or the base salary of a participant. For 2018, the partnership level percentage of the NEOs was 15% of base salary for Mr. Murphy, 10% of base salary for Ms. Short and Messrs. Griffith and Seitz, and 8% of base salary for Mr. Buhr. The "base bonus" for each NEO participant is equal to the participant's base salary multiplied by the relevant partnership share percentage. That dollar amount is further adjusted up or down by the "Company Performance Factor." The Company Performance Factor is 2.5 times the percentage by which actual net income for the year exceeded (or missed) budgeted net income with a maximum adjustment of 25%. The Committee is authorized to make adjustments to reported net income for purposes of determining the Corporate Performance Factor. Historically, the Committee has done so when, in the Committee's judgment, the reported net income included unusual or one-time items that distorted the true substantive or normalized earnings of the Company. The Committee chose to use the Company's reported net income of $82.41 million without adjustment to calculate the Company Performance Factor.
For 2018, net income was approximately 0.3% over budget resulting in a positive adjustment of 1% for the Company Performance Factor. Thus, the Company Performance Factor for 2018 was 101%.
For each individual, the base bonus after adjustment for the Company Performance Factor is further adjusted up or down between 0% and 300% based upon the participant's performance against a set of corporate, group and individual performance goals established at the beginning of the fiscal year. Target amounts are scored at 150% of weighting for staff management personnel while they are scored at 200% for sales, credit and line management personnel. For example, if the Company achieves a corporate-level goal exactly at target and the goal is weighted for the individual at 10%, a staff person's result is scored as 15% of their base salary or salary range midpoint assigned for EIP purposes while a sales, credit or line person's result is scored as 20% of their base salary or salary range midpoint assigned for EIP purposes. The total of the annual cash and stock awards to a single participant may not exceed $1 million.
The corporate-level financial performance goals for each of the NEOs in 2018 included a combination of the following depending upon the NEO's role and responsibilities:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Objective Minimum Target Maximum Actual 
Net income $81,316 $82,139 $83,784 $82,414

[END TABLE]
 In assessing performance against these performance goals, the Committee considers quantitative and qualitative factors, and ultimately uses its judgment when determining the amount and terms of individual awards. However, in the calculation of Mr. Murphy's award, his award was first calculated based upon quantitative factors in order to comply with IRS Code Section 162(m). Then the Committee has the authority to consider qualitative factors to reduce the amount of the award to Mr. Murphy. The qualitative factors the Committee considers to adjust awards include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The recommendations of Mr. Murphy with respect to the achievement of group and individual performance goals of the other NEOs and all other participants in the EIP. 
[END TABLE]
• An analysis of competitive marketplace compensation data as described above;
• An analysis of the Company's performance compared to its peer groups as described above;
• An analysis of the Company's performance compared to its overall quantitative and qualitative goals;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's level of responsibility and ability to influence the Company's performance; 
• The executive's level of experience, skills and knowledge; 
• The need to retain and motivate highly talented executives; 
• Corporate governance considerations related to executive compensation; and 
• The Company's current business environment, objectives and strategy. 
[END TABLE]
For 2018, Mr. Murphy received the award as computed based upon quantitative factors. Messrs. Murphy, Seitz, and Buhr were scored as part of sales, credit and line management personnel. Mr. Griffith and Ms. Short were scored as part of staff management personnel.
Annual cash awards: These are paid following the Committee's approval of the awards. For the NEOs, the Committee approved cash awards for 2018 performance as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Mr. Murphy $234,850   Mr. Griffith $57,950 
Mr. Seitz $75,200   Mr. Buhr $55,800 
Ms. Short $64,750       
[END TABLE]
These amounts are shown on the 2018 lines of the "Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Plan" column of the Summary Compensation Table below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Annual Book Value Stock Awards: The amount of the annual cash award under the EIP is matched with an equal amount of book value stock that is subject to forfeiture ratably over a five-year period in the event the Company fails to achieve designated annual performance hurdles or the participant's employment terminates. For 2018, the Committee chose a 5% EPS growth requirement or a 1.20% annual return on assets as alternative performance hurdles for releasing the forfeiture restrictions on the awards of book value stock approved for 2018 performance. The Committee believes that this combination of requirements collectively represents a reasonable hurdle for participants to motivate future performance based on, among other factors, the peer group performance documented above. The Committee also has the authority under the EIP to evaluate whether forfeiture of book value shares is appropriate if the Company's performance results are in the top quartile of its peer groups notwithstanding failure of the Company to achieve the performance hurdles. This additional authority gives the Committee flexibility to respond to external events or market conditions. 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Murphy's annual cash award is matched with an equivalent value in book value stock subject to the same performance hurdles as with all employees under the EIP. As the risk of forfeiture lapses over the five year period based on achievement of performance hurdles, he is paid in cash. His book value stock awards ultimately paid in cash are shown in the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table in the year the awards are made, consistent with the presentation for the other NEOs. The Committee believes Mr. Murphy's ownership interest in the Company is already significant and sufficiently aligned with shareholder interests that the book value share awards under the EIP can be denominated and paid in cash as the forfeiture risk lapses.
The annual stock awards for 2018 performance were made in calendar year 2019. As required by SEC rules, the 2018 stock award amounts for the NEOs will be shown in next year's proxy statement on the 2019 lines under the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table. The annual book value stock awards for 2017 (made in 2018) are shown on the 2018 lines of the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table below as required by SEC rules.
Long-Term Plan Awards Under the EIP
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Why we pay this component 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the annual incentive award of cash and book value stock, the EIP also offers participants an additional periodic award of cash and stock in the event the Company achieves longer-term performance goals. These performance goals are established periodically (usually every 3 years) as part of the Company's ongoing long-term strategic planning process. These awards are also designed to reward consistent individual performance over the long term as individual performance is calculated based on the participant's average annual incentive awards under the EIP over the three-year period. These awards further reinforce alignment with the interests of our shareholders by encouraging a long-term view with sound strategic planning and risk management and providing participants with an opportunity for additional ownership of the Company but with the same market risk to which shareholders of the Company are exposed.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How we determine the amount.  
• Calculation of Amount of the Long-Term Plan Awards: The most recent 3-year performance goal period ended in 2016 with targets set in early 2014 and awards being determined and paid in early 2017. The 2014-2016 targets, results and payments to the NEOs are reported in our 2017 and 2018 proxy statements. 
[END TABLE]
 The goals for the 2017-2019 period include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Weighting Minimum Target Maximum 
Return on assets 15% 87% of Target Target 113% of Target 
Expense to revenue ratio 15% 104% of Target Target 96% of Target 
Net interest margin 10% 96% of Target Target 106% of Target 
Net charge offs and other credit-related losses to average loans, leases, repossessed assets and other real estate 15% 180% of Target Target 60% of Target 
Period-end nonperforming assets 15% 133% of Target Target 50% of Target 
Growth in net new primary relationships 30% 51% of Target Target 119% of Target 
[END TABLE]
Company performance is scored at 50% for minimum, 100% for target and 200% for maximum. The three year awards then are calculated based upon a pre-determined mathematical formula that multiplies the Company's weighted performance relative to its long-term goals by an assigned percentage and then by the participant's average annual incentive award under the EIP over the three year period. The participant may earn from 0% to 200% of his/her average annual incentive awards over the three year period. The total of the annual cash and stock awards to a single participant may not exceed $1 million.
For the 2017-2019 period, the assigned percentages of the NEOs for purposes of the three year long-term awards are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Mr. Murphy 100%   Mr. Griffith 90% 
Mr. Seitz 100%   Mr. Buhr 90% 
Ms. Short 90%       
• Method of Payment of Periodic Long-Term Awards: The periodic long-term awards are paid with a combination of cash and market value stock, with more senior participants required to take a higher percentage of stock. The stock portion is subject to forfeiture over a five-year period based upon the participant remaining with the Company and the Company remaining profitable during the period.  
[END TABLE]
The cash portions of the 2014-16 awards are shown on the 2016 lines of the Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Plan column of the Summary Compensation Table. The stock portions of the 2014-16 awards were made in calendar year 2017 and are shown in this proxy statement on the 2017 lines of the Stock Awards column of the Summary Compensation Table as required by SEC rules.
Annual Incentive Awards Under the Strategic Deployment Incentive Plan (SDIP)
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Why we pay this component. 
[END TABLE]
NEOs have an additional incentive compensation plan available to them which is designed to encourage execution of the Company's strategic objectives on an annual and a long-term basis. NEOs and other members of senior management are eligible to participate. Mr. Murphy, Ms. Short and Messrs. Buhr, Griffith and Seitz were participants in the SDIP for 2018.
Any awards ("Awards") made to participants under the SDIP are performance-based compensation with three dimensions. First, the SDIP is designed to encourage the participants to focus on initiatives that support the Company's long-term strategic objectives but not at the expense of meeting or exceeding the expectations of our shareholders as reflected in the annual performance goals approved by the Board. Thus, there will be no Awards unless the Company achieves its minimum net income goal.
Second, the amount of the Awards is calculated as a percentage of the Company's annual net income. Sharing a modest portion of net income with the participants who successfully lead and execute the initiatives designed to meet the Company's long-term strategic objectives directly aligns their performance on these initiatives with the long-term interests of shareholders. At the beginning of each calendar year, the Committee sets a range for each of the participants reflected by a minimum, target and maximum percentage of net income. In setting the percentages, the Committee considers the roles and responsibilities of each participant with respect to the Company's long-term strategic objectives.
Third, the Committee determines the final percentage of net income within the respective pre-established ranges by reference to pre-established shared and/or individual goals for the participants that support the Company's long-term strategic objectives ("Annual Strategic Goals"). The Committee assigns Annual Strategic Goals to each of the participants at the beginning of each calendar year using objective performance targets or criteria and weightings among the Annual Strategic Goals. The Committee then uses the results achieved during the calendar year (individually or in aggregate) to determine the Award for each participant within the applicable range of percentages of net income. See "How we determine the amount" below for calculation and the payment of awards.
All determinations of eligibility, Annual Strategic Goals, financial metrics and formulas for calculation of Awards for a calendar year are established by the Committee in writing no later than ninety (90) days after the beginning of the calendar year or by such other date as may be permitted under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations thereunder. No Award to any single participant can exceed $1 million in one calendar year. No performance measures for a participant's Annual Strategic Goals will allow for any discretion by the Committee to increase an Award over the maximum percentage of net income determined by the Committee at the beginning of the calendar year, but the Committee does have discretion to reduce an Award below the maximum percentage of net income to any amount it believes is justified based on the actual results achieved related to the Annual Strategic Goals. The payment of any Award under the SDIP to a participant with respect to a relevant calendar year is contingent upon certification by the Committee prior to any such payment that the applicable performance measure(s) or criteria for the participant's Annual Strategic Goals have been satisfied. All awards under the SDIP are subject to potential forfeiture and/or recovery by the Company in the event they are based upon financial results that are subsequently determined to have been overstated. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How we determine the amount. 
[END TABLE]
Under this program, awards for participants are based on the net income of the Company. The Committee set the range from 0.00% to 1.37% of net income for the total program with a target of 0.68% for 2018. All awards are subject to the Company achieving a minimum net income of $78.0 million. The Committee set the following individual award levels as a percentage of the Company's net income:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Minimum Target Maximum 
Mr. Murphy 0% 0.26% 0.51% 
Mr. Seitz 0% 0.13% 0.26% 
Ms. Short 0% 0.13% 0.26% 
Mr. Griffith 0% 0.09% 0.17% 
Mr. Buhr 0% 0.09% 0.17% 
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the goals and weightings were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Weighting 
1. Achieve 2018 core deposit growth goals for specific growth markets. Goals were set at a target of 150% or 200% of the market growth rate for core deposits. Maximum score for each targeted level is based on 150% of the goal amount. 38% 
2. Adoption and full implementation of a sales management system across the bank. Selection of vendor and design phase for loan work flow by year end. 20% 
3. Achieve targeted levels of mobile and digital product adoption by both business and consumer customers. Maximum score for each targeted level is based on between 150% and 200% of the goal amount. 36% 
4. Increase number of certified lean daily managers and reduce rate of bank-wide turnover excluding involuntary turnover and retirements. 6% 
Total weighting using metrics set at the beginning of the year 100% 
5. Qualitative goal to be judgmentally used by the Committee to adjust downward the awards under the above metrics either for the group or for each NEO individually.   
[END TABLE]
The Committee assesses performance against these goals and each individual's contributions to the achievement of the goals including the quality of teamwork exhibited and the individual's contribution to the team. In assessing performance against these performance goals, the Committee considers quantitative factors first and may adjust downward for qualitative factors, and ultimately uses its judgment when determining the amount and terms of individual awards.
The Company earned net income that exceeded the minimum net income goal of $78.0 million. The Committee chose to pay the entire bonus amounts in cash. The annual cash awards are paid following the Committee's approval of the awards. For the 2018 participants, the Committee approved cash awards for 2018 performance as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Mr. Murphy $280,200 
Mr. Seitz $140,100 
Ms. Short $140,100 
Mr. Griffith $90,700 
Mr. Buhr $90,700

Awards Under the 1982 Restricted Stock Award Plan
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Why we pay this component. 
[END TABLE]
The Restricted Stock Award Plan provides for the grant of restricted shares to selected executives and other key employees of the Company as a means of inducing continued future employment and performance of such key employees. The Restricted Stock Award Plan provides that the shares shall vest over a period of time if the participant continues to serve as an employee. Additionally, the Committee may set additional vesting requirements at the time of grant based on the individual participant's performance, the Company's financial performance or both. If the participant does not meet or exceed his or her individual performance goal(s) for a given year, all shares so restricted with respect to that year will be forfeited. If 1st Source does not meet the financial requirements by the end of the vesting period, the shares so restricted are forfeited. The Committee retains discretion to make periodic stock awards from time to time in the future to maximize the usefulness of the Restricted Stock Award Plan in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How we determine the amount. 
[END TABLE]
No named executive officers received awards under the Restricted Stock Award Plan in 2016, 2017, or 2018. Stock Ownership Guidelines
In February 2015, the Company established stock ownership guidelines for its NEOs. The Company requires the CEO to own Company stock with value at least equal to five times the CEO's current base salary and other NEOs to own Company stock with a value at least equal to three times the NEO's current base salary. All of the Company's NEOs are currently in compliance with this requirement.
Hedging or Pledging Company Securities
In February 2015, the Company adopted a policy prohibiting directors, NEOs and other Senior Vice Presidents or above from pledging shares of the Company on margin, trading in derivative securities of the Company's common stock, engaging in short sales or buying or selling put or call options on the Company's common stock, and purchasing or selling other financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's common stock. Shares owned by directors, NEOs and other Senior Vice Presidents in excess of those required to be owned by Company stock ownership guidelines may be used as collateral for the owner's personal or business borrowing purposes upon notification of and prior approval by the Governance and Nominating Committee.
Most Recent Shareholder Advisory Vote
The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee carefully considered the results of the 2017 shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. The CEO also reviewed and discussed the results of the vote with selected larger shareholders. The result of the advisory vote was that 99% of votes cast approved of the executive compensation of the NEOs as described in the 2017 Proxy Statement. The results indicated shareholder support for the Company's executive compensation decisions and policies and the Committee has continued to make its compensation decisions consistent with historical practice and existing policies. The Committee also carefully considered the results of the 2017 shareholder advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The result of the advisory vote was that 67% of votes cast supported a vote every three years. The Committee elected to continue its practice of having a vote every three years.
Shareholders are given an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation program every three years with the next opportunity occurring in connection with the annual shareholder meeting in April 2020.
Shareholders are also given an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation with the next opportunity occurring in connection with the annual shareholder meeting in April 2023.
Risk Management
As discussed above, the senior executive officer compensation plans and other management incentive programs include both equity and cash components that link compensation to the Company's overall performance on both a short-term and long-term basis, subject to forfeiture based on the senior executive officers or participating management officers failing to remain with the Company and on long-term real economic performance of the Company. As such, these plans do not encourage the senior executive officers or participating management officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the Company. Nor do they encourage the manipulation of earnings of the Company to enhance the compensation of any employee. 
The Committee also identified and reviewed the Company's five business unit incentive plans, each of which rewards measurable performance in the Company's five major product and service segments: Business Banking, Consumer Banking, Specialty Finance, Trust and Asset Management, and Insurance. Each of these incentive plans has common features that encourage high quality, long-term relationship business and discourage unnecessary or excessive risks for short-term gain. In particular, short-term cash awards generally are capped at a specific dollar amount or a percentage of a participant's salary midpoint or base salary. In practice, actual awards generally have been much less than the maximum amount after applying the respective individual performance metrics under the plans. Annual stock awards are similarly limited to a percentage of a participant's salary midpoint and have long-term attributes. They carry substantial risks of forfeiture over a five-year period if performance hurdles that are tied to Company performance are not cleared. They are made in book value common stock transferable only to the Company upon death, disability, normal retirement, early termination of employment, or with discretionary approval of the Committee, with less favorable payout terms upon early termination of employment. The incentive plans for lenders further mitigate excessive risks by including substantial weightings or deductions for credit quality and net charge-offs. The Committee also identified and reviewed the Company's referral programs designed to encourage internal referrals by providing small, immaterial cash incentives to eligible participants. 
These features, combined with the systems of controls in place to mitigate the risks of the products and services the Company offers, limit and discourage the taking of unnecessary or excessive risks. They also discourage and mitigate the risk of manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of any employee. None of these incentive plans or referral programs, alone or in aggregate, encourages unnecessary or excessive risks or presents significant risks to the Company as a whole.
Clawbacks
If the Company (i) is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company's noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, or (ii) otherwise determines that financial results or other metrics used to determine the amount of any incentive awards paid or awarded to any Participants were misstated or otherwise inaccurate, then the Committee shall, except in the case of any Participant who had no responsibility for the accounting that led to the misstatement or inaccuracy, recoup any excess incentive compensation received by any such Participant. The Committee shall recoup all incentive compensation received by any Participant who had responsibilities for the accounting that led to the misstatement or inaccuracy or who the Committee determines committed fraud or other malfeasance while employed by the Company. Employment Agreements Severance Provisions
Among the NEOs, the Company has entered into employment agreements with Mr. Murphy, Mr. Seitz, Ms. Short, Mr. Griffith, and Mr. Buhr. The agreements provide for severance payments in the event of the executive's termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive because of good reason, including a material adverse change in his or her status such as a material diminution of responsibility or relocation. In such event, the executive would continue to receive only his or her base salary for a period of time after his or her termination. Mr. Murphy would receive the equivalent of 36 months of base salary with the first six months payable in a lump sum. Mr. Seitz, Ms. Short, Mr Griffith, and Mr. Buhr would receive the equivalent of twelve months of base salary with the first six months payable in a lump sum. The Committee believes that providing severance payments to certain executives in the event the executives terminate employment because of a material adverse change in status is necessary and fair given the critical nature of the roles of the executives. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Seitz, Ms. Short, Mr. Griffith, and Mr. Buhr would receive $2.25 million, $355,000, $325,000, $365,000, and $310,000, respectively under the agreements.
The employment agreements also provide for severance payments in the event Mr. Murphy, Mr. Seitz, Ms. Short, Mr. Griffith, or Mr. Buhr terminates his or her employment for good reason within one year of a change in control transaction. Under these circumstances, the executive would receive severance pay in cash equal to 2.99 times his or her "Annualized Includable Compensation for the Base Period" (as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) without a gross-up provision. The Committee reaffirmed its long-standing view that such a "two-trigger" change in control provision for key executives is consistent with the interests of shareholders and fair protection to the executives.
Tax Deductibility of Pay
Federal income tax law caps at $1,000,000 the deductible compensation per year for each of the NEOs, subject to certain exceptions (some of which changed in 2018). In developing and implementing executive compensation policies and programs, the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee considers whether particular payments and awards are deductible for federal income tax purposes, along with other relevant factors. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee has taken what it believes to be appropriate steps to maximize the deductibility of executive compensation. It is the general intention of the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee to meet the requirements for deductibility whenever possible. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee will continue to review and monitor the deductibility of compensation.

The Audit Committee has appointed BKD LLP (BKD) as the independent registered public accounting firm for 1st Source for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee made their decision on a number of factors, including the strength and reputation of the firm and its proposed service team, its expertise in the commercial banking and financial services industries, its legal and regulatory record, its relative cost, its ability to provide research and professional development resources to 1st Source personnel and other factors. The Board of Directors has determined that the appointment will be submitted for ratification by the shareholders. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommend that shareholders ratify the appointment of BKD as the independent registered accounting firm for the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will investigate the basis for the negative vote and will reconsider its appointment in light of the results of such investigation.
2019 will be the fifth year that BKD will serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. Representatives of BKD will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be afforded an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to questions from shareholders.

The Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee shall pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and that the Audit Committee shall not engage the independent auditors to perform the specific non-audit services proscribed by law or regulation. The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee. The decisions of any Audit Committee member to whom pre-approval authority is delegated must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All fees paid to BKD LLP in 2018 for non-audit services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
PROPOSALS OF SECURITY HOLDERS
Proposals submitted by security holders for presentation at the next Annual Meeting must be submitted in writing to the Secretary, 1st Source Corporation, on or before November 1, 2019.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Receipt of a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast in the election of directors at the annual meeting is required for election of directors. Ratification of the appointment of independent auditors requires that the votes cast in favor exceed the votes cast against. The Company knows of no other proposals expected to be presented at the meeting. Such a proposal, if any, would be approved if votes in favor of such proposal exceed those cast against. The SEC's rules permit a company to deliver a single proxy statement, annual report, notice of internet availability of proxy materials or prospectus to an address shared by two or more of its shareholders. This method of delivery is referred to as "householding." Unless shareholders request otherwise, 1st Source will "household" their proxy statement and annual report, as well as any prospectus or notice of internet availability of proxy materials, which may be sent to them. Regardless of how many 1st Source shareholders live under one roof, they will receive a single copy of each proxy statement, annual report, notice of internet availability of proxy materials or prospectus that is being mailed to shareholders. However, 1st Source will continue to deliver to every 1st Source shareholder in a household an individual proxy card in connection with any meeting of its shareholders where votes are being cast.
If a shareholder prefers to receive individual copies of proxy statements, annual reports, notice of internet availability of proxy materials or prospectuses, the shareholder should write to Chuck Ditto, Trust Operations, 1st Source Corporation, P. O. Box 1602, South Bend, IN 46634. 1st Source will start sending separate documents to a requesting shareholder of record within 30 days of the request.
Beneficial shareholders can request information about householding from their banks, brokers or other holders of record.
Important Notice Regarding The Availability Of Proxy Materials For The Shareholder Meeting To Be Held On April 18, 2019: The Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement, Annual Report and Proxy Card are available at www.proxyvote.com.
A copy of 1st Source's Annual Report on Form 10-K is furnished herewith to shareholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, containing financial statements for such year.
