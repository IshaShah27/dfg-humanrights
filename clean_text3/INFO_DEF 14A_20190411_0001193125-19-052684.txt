IHS MARKIT LTD. 
PROXY STATEMENT FOR 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD ON APRIL 11, 2019 
INFORMATION CONCERNING PROXY SOLICITATION 
AND VOTING 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of IHS Markit Ltd., a Bermuda company, of proxies for the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") and any adjournments or postponements thereof. The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 11, 2019, 9:00 a.m. local time, at the IHS Markit corporate headquarters, 4th Floor, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY, United Kingdom. 
This Proxy Statement, the IHS Markit Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2018 (the "Annual Report"), and the accompanying Proxy Card are being first sent to shareholders on or about February 27, 2019. We are providing notice and electronic access to our proxy materials to our shareholders. The notice will be mailed on or about February 27, 2019. The notice contains instructions regarding how to access and review our proxy materials over the internet or receive a hard copy. The notice also provides instructions regarding how to submit a proxy over the internet. We believe that this process allows us to provide shareholders with important information in a timely manner, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. 
On July 12, 2016, we completed a merger between IHS Inc. ("IHS"), Markit Ltd. ("Markit"), and Marvel Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of Markit Ltd. (the "Merger"). Upon completion of the Merger, Markit Ltd. became the public combined group holding company and was renamed IHS Markit Ltd. IHS Inc. was treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, which is reflected in the results of operations, financial position, financial statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report. 
References in this Proxy Statement to "we," "us," "our," the "Company," and "IHS Markit" refer to IHS Markit Ltd. and our consolidated subsidiaries. 
We operate on a November 30 fiscal year-end. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Proxy Statement to an individual year means the fiscal year ended November 30. For example, "2018" refers to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 and "2017" refers to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. 
Appointment of Proxy Holders 
The Board of Directors of IHS Markit (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") asks you to appoint the following individuals as your proxy holders to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting: 
Lance Uggla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; 
Todd Hyatt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and 
Sari Granat, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel.  You may make this appointment by using one of the methods described below. If appointed by you, the proxy holders will vote your shares as you direct on the matters described in this Proxy Statement. In the absence of your direction, they will vote your shares if you sign the proxy card as recommended by the Board. 
Unless you otherwise indicate on the Proxy Card, you also authorize your proxy holders to vote your shares on any matters not known by the Board at the time this Proxy Statement was printed and that, under our amended and restated bye-laws ("bye-laws"), may be properly presented for action at the Annual Meeting. 
Who Can Vote 
Only shareholders who owned our common shares at the close of business on February 14, 2019—the Record Date for the Annual Meeting—can vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Each holder of our common shares is entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date. As of the close of business on the Record Date, we had 424,625,307 common shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, including 25,219,470 issued and outstanding common shares held by the Markit Group Holdings Limited Employee Benefit Trust (the "EBT"). The trustee of the EBT may not vote any common shares held by the EBT unless we direct otherwise. We intend to direct the EBT to vote the common shares held by the EBT on each proposal at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the percentages voted by other holders of common shares on such proposal. 
Our common shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the symbol "INFO." 
How You Can Vote 
The common shares represented by any proxy in the enclosed form will be voted in accordance with the instructions given on the proxy if the proxy is properly executed and is received by us prior to the close of voting at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Any proxies returned without instructions will be voted FOR the proposals set forth in the Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. 
Revocation of Proxies 
A shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. A proxy may be revoked by: 
(i) filing with the Secretary of the Company prior to the Annual Meeting a written notice of revocation by mail to IHS Markit Ltd., Attention: Company Secretary, c/o Legal Department, IHS Markit Ltd., 4th Floor, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY, United Kingdom; 
(ii) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date that we receive prior to the conclusion of voting at the Annual Meeting; 
(iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person; or 
(iv) logging onto www.proxyvote.com in the same manner you would to submit your proxy electronically or calling 1-800-690-6903, and in either case following the instructions to revoke or change your voting instructions.  Quorum 
Two or more persons present at the start of the Annual Meeting and representing, in person or by proxy, in excess of 50 percent of the total issued common shares in the Company entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (including the common shares held by the EBT) shall form a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. 
If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference, your shares will be counted toward a quorum but they will not be voted on any given proposal (see "—Required Vote" below). "Broker non-votes" (see "—Required Vote" below) will be counted as common shares that are present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will have no effect with respect to any matter for which a broker does not have authority to vote. 
Required Vote 
For Proposal 1, the election of our Class II directors, each person receiving a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director) will be elected as a Director. You may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting for each of the nominees to become a director. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to the proposal, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. 
For Proposal 2, approval of the appointment of our independent registered public accountants, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the issue, either in person or by proxy, will be required to approve. You may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting on the proposal. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to the proposal, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. 
For Proposal 3, advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the issue, either in person or by proxy, will be required to approve. You may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting on the proposal. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to the proposal, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. 
For Proposal 4, approval of amendments to the Company's bye-laws to implement "proxy access" and certain related changes, the affirmative vote of not less than 66-2/3 percent of the votes attaching to all shares in issue, either in person or by proxy, will be required to approve. You may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting the proposal. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to the proposal, your vote will have the same effect as a vote "against" such proposal. 
Brokers cannot vote your shares on "non-routine" matters without your voting instructions. In those cases, if you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, it will be considered a "broker non-vote" and your broker or nominee will not be permitted to vote those shares. Your broker or nominee will be entitled to cast uninstructed votes only on Proposal 2, the approval of the appointment of our independent registered public accountants. 
We encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
We will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited in person or by mail, telephone and electronic transmission on our behalf by directors, officers or employees of IHS Markit or its   subsidiaries, without additional compensation. We will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries that are requested to forward soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of the common shares held of record by such persons. 
Multiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Mailing Address 
Multiple IHS Markit shareholders who share an address may receive only one copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report, unless the shareholder gives instructions to the contrary. This delivery method, called "householding", will not be used if we receive contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders sharing a mailing address. We will deliver promptly a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to any IHS Markit shareholder who resides at a shared address and to which a single copy of the documents was delivered if the shareholder makes a request by contacting the Company Secretary, c/o Legal Department, IHS Markit Ltd., 4th Floor, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY, United Kingdom or by telephone at +44 207 260 200 or by email at CompanySecretary@ihsmarkit.com. 
If your household has received multiple copies of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement, you can request the delivery of single copies in the future by marking the designated box on the attached proxy card. 
If you own common shares through a bank, broker or other nominee and receive more than one Annual Report and Proxy Statement, contact the holder of record to eliminate duplicate mailings.

Important Reminder 
Please promptly provide your voting instructions by submitting your proxy in writing or by telephone or internet, or if you hold your common shares through a bank or broker, as instructed by your bank or broker. 
To submit written voting instructions, you may sign, date, and return the enclosed Proxy Card. To submit voting instructions telephonically or by internet, follow the instructions provided on the Proxy Card. 
Submitting voting instructions by proxy will not limit your rights to attend or vote at the Annual Meeting.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Directors and Nominees 
Pursuant to the authority granted to the Board by the Company's bye-laws, the Board determined that it be composed of 12 directors, divided into three classes. However, our bye-laws were amended and restated in 2018 to eliminate the classified structure of our Board over a three-year period and provide that all director nominees standing for election upon completion of their term after the 2018 annual general meeting would be elected to a one-year term. Each director elected at our 2018 annual general meeting will hold office for a three-year term until our 2021 annual general meeting. Each director serving as a Class II director immediately prior to the 2018 annual general meeting will hold office until the Annual Meeting. Each director serving as a Class III director immediately prior to the 2018 annual general meeting will hold office until the 2020 annual general meeting. Any director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy pursuant to our bye-laws shall hold office until the next annual general meeting of shareholders held after the date of such appointment. 
Four directors who serve as Class II directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting. These directors will hold office until the annual general meeting of shareholders in 2020, or until their respective offices shall otherwise be vacated pursuant to the Company's bye-laws. Each director nominee set forth below has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement as a nominee for election as director and has agreed to serve as a director if elected. In the event that any of the nominees should become unavailable prior to the Annual Meeting, proxies in the enclosed form will be voted for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of directors to constitute the entire Board, in its discretion. 
Majority Vote Standard for Election of Directors 
Our amended and restated bye-laws require directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to each director in uncontested elections, and a director nominee will be elected as a director only if the votes cast "for" the director nominee exceed the votes cast "against" the director nominee. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast for or against a director nominee. If the Board determines that an election of directors is contested (i.e., the number of director nominees in any one year exceeds the number of directors to be elected in that year), our bye-laws provide that a plurality voting standard will apply and the director nominees receiving the greatest number of votes (up to the number of directors to be elected) will be elected. Under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, any incumbent director who fails to be re-elected may not continue to sit on the Board after their term in office has expired and their position on the Board is left vacant. If any director positions are left vacant following a general meeting, the Board may reduce its size or, if authorized by shareholders, may fill such vacant positions.  2019 Nominees For Director 
For more information about each director nominee, our continuing directors, and the operation of our Board, see "Corporate Governance and Board of Directors—Business Experience and Qualifications of Board Members."

Vote Required and Recommendation 
For Proposal 1, directors are elected by a majority vote, which means that each person receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast (the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director) will be elected as a Director. You may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting for each of the nominees to become a Class II director. If you "abstain" from voting with respect to the proposal, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. If you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 1, your broker or nominee will not be entitled to cast votes and a "broker non-vote" on Proposal 1 will result. "Broker non-votes" are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the vote for this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" 
THE ELECTION OF THESE NOMINEES  PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
The Board is submitting for approval at the Annual Meeting the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants until the close of the next annual general meeting of shareholders to audit our books, records, and accounts and those of our subsidiaries for 2019, and to authorize the Board, acting by the Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, to determine the remuneration of the independent registered public accountants. 
Ernst & Young LLP has advised the Company that the firm does not have any direct or indirect financial interest in the Company, nor has such firm had any such interest in connection with the Company during the past three fiscal years other than in its capacity as the Company's (and prior to July 12, 2016, IHS Inc.'s) independent registered public accountants. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
Audit, Audit-Related, and Tax Fees 
In connection with the audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, IHS Markit entered into an engagement agreement with Ernst & Young LLP that set forth the terms by which Ernst & Young LLP performed audit services for IHS Markit. Aggregate fees for professional services rendered for us by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and November 30, 2017 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 6,433      $ 5,543   
 Audit-Related Fees      2,843        1,373   
 Tax Fees      25        13   
 All Other Fees      —          —     
 Total    $ 9,301      $ 6,929   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, the statutory audit of our subsidiaries, the review of our interim consolidated financial statements, and other services provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. 
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's consolidated financial statements and are not reported under "—Audit Fees." These services may include employee benefit plan audits, due diligence services related to acquisitions and divestitures, auditing work on proposed transactions, attestation services that are not required by regulation or statute, and consultations regarding financial accounting or reporting standards. For 2018, audit-related fees included approximately $1,637,000 for attestation reports for service organizations and $1,093,000 for due   diligence services rendered related to acquisitions and divestitures. For 2017, audit-related fees included approximately $826,000 for attestation reports for service organizations and $434,000 for due diligence services rendered related to acquisitions and divestitures. 
Tax Fees. Tax fees consist of tax compliance consultations, preparation of tax reports, and other tax services. 
Audit Committee Pre-approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has implemented pre-approval policies and procedures related to the provision of audit and non-audit services by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accountants. Under these procedures, the Audit Committee pre-approves both the type of services to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP and the estimated fees related to these services. 
During the approval process, the Audit Committee considers the impact of the types of services and the related fees on the independence of the registered public accountants. The services and fees must be deemed compatible with the maintenance of such accountants' independence, including compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ. 
The Audit Committee has delegated authority to pre-approve services performed by Ernst & Young LLP to the chair of the Audit Committee for services of up to $500,000, with any approvals pursuant to such delegated authority regularly reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has not delegated any of its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by Ernst & Young LLP to management. Throughout the year, the Audit Committee will review any revisions to the estimates of audit and non-audit fees initially approved. No such services were approved pursuant to the procedures described in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, which waives the general requirement for pre-approval in certain circumstances. 
Vote Required and Recommendation 
Approval of Proposal 2 will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted "FOR" this Proposal 2 regarding the approval of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accountants until the close of the next annual general meeting of shareholders and the authorization of the Board, acting by the Audit Committee, to determine the remuneration of the independent registered public accountants. 
With respect to Proposal 2, you may instruct to vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting on, such proposal. If you "abstain" from voting, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. If you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 2, your broker or nominee will be entitled to cast discretionary votes on Proposal 2 as such proposal is a "routine" matter. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF 
ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
UNTIL THE CLOSE OF THE NEXT ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING AND THE AUTHORIZATION 
OF THE BOARD, ACTING BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, TO DETERMINE THE 
REMUNERATION OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS  PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
At the 2017 annual general meeting of shareholders, we conducted an advisory, non-binding vote regarding the frequency with which we would seek approval of the compensation of our named executive officers. At such meeting, shareholders expressed their preference for an annual vote on executive compensation on an advisory, non-binding basis and, consistent with this preference, the Board determined that we will conduct such a vote on an annual basis. 
Accordingly, and pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote, on an advisory, nonbinding basis, on the compensation of our named executive officers (sometimes referred to herein as "NEOs") for 2018, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," compensation tables and related material. 
Our executive compensation program for 2018 is geared towards driving long-term, sustainable business performance. It is governed by the following guiding principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● It is fully consistent with our business objectives and strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● It drives accountability and transparency, and aligns executive compensation with shareholders interests.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● It supports our mission, vision and values.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The philosophy is designed to attract, retain and motivate top talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our programs are globally consistent and locally competitive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our short-term incentives are aligned to key business objectives appropriate to colleague role and business segment.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We provide long-term incentives that align colleague and shareholder interests and promote shareholder return.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We have a pay-for-performance culture that  is incentivized to achieve business performance that will sustain growth across the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The program takes into account both affordability and IHS Markits risk appetite, ensuring that our incentive plans do  not encourage any undue risk taking, and strives to avoid any undue complexity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The program strengthens alignment with shareholders, through significant share ownership guidelines that apply to both  executive officers and directors.  
[END TABLE]
The Human Resources Committee continually reviews the compensation programs for our NEOs to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our shareholders' interests and current market practices. 
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation program and practices as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this Proxy Statement.  We are asking our shareholders to approve the compensation program and practices of our NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement (which includes the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables, and related material). 
Vote Required and Recommendation 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company, the Human Resources Committee, or the Board. The Board and the Human Resources Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and, to the extent there is a significant vote against the named executive officer compensation policies and practices as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns and the Human Resources Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
Unless you instruct us to the contrary, proxies will be voted "FOR" this Proposal 3 regarding named executive officer compensation policies and practices, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," and the other related tables and disclosures in this Proxy Statement. 
With respect to Proposal 3, you may instruct your vote "for" or "against," or "abstain" from voting on, such proposal. If you "abstain" from voting, your vote is not considered a vote cast and will have no effect for such proposal. If you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 3, your broker or nominee will not be entitled to cast votes and a "broker non-vote" on Proposal 3 will result. Broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the vote for this proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE 
APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S 
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT 
PURSUANT TO ITEM 402 OF REGULATION S-K  PROPOSAL 4: AMENDMENTS TO BYE-LAWS TO IMPLEMENT PROXY ACCESS AND RELATED CHANGES 
The Board is submitting for approval at the Annual Meeting amendments to our bye-laws to implement "proxy access" to our shareholders. Proxy access would allow eligible shareholders to nominate candidates for election to our Board and have those nominees included in our proxy materials, along with the candidates nominated by the Board. 
As part of the Company's commitment to effective governance practices, management and the Board considered evolving trends and the views of institutional shareholders and, after careful consideration, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has determined that it is appropriate to propose for shareholder consideration amendments to our bye-laws that, if adopted, would implement proxy access. 
If this proposal is adopted, our bye-laws would be amended and restated to provide that the Company would, subject to certain requirements and limitations, include in its proxy statement for an annual general meeting, names of any person or persons nominated for election as a director by any qualifying shareholder, required disclosure about each person nominated, a statement supporting the nomination by the shareholder and any other information the Board determined to include in the proxy statement related to the nomination. 
The amendments also include a change to Bye-law 38 adopted in 2018 to phase out our classified board as part of our plan to adopt majority voting and implement a "proxy access" bye-law, and certain other immaterial changes, including revising certain defined terms. In particular, the amendments correct a transcription error in the transition terms of Class II and III directors set forth in the bye-law to conform to the correct terms set forth in the proxy disclosure for the proposal in the 2018 proxy statement that was approved by shareholders. 
The following description is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the proposed amendments. You are urged to read the proposed amendments in their entirety. The specific language of the proposed amendments to our bye-laws is set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement and is marked to show the proposed changes. 
Amendments to Implement Proxy Access 
Shareholder Eligibility to Nominate Directors 
Any shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders that has continuously maintained ownership of at least 3 percent of the shares of the Company's outstanding common shares for at least three years would be permitted to nominate the greater of two candidates or up to 20 percent of the Board. Any two or more funds under common management and investment control would generally count as one shareholder. 
Calculation of Qualifying Ownership 
A nominating shareholder would be deemed to own only those outstanding common shares of the Company as to which the shareholder possesses both the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit from and risk of loss on) such shares.  The following shares would not count as "owned" shares for purposes of determining whether the ownership threshold has been met: shares sold in any transaction that has not been settled or closed; shares borrowed or purchased pursuant to an agreement to resell; or shares subject to any derivative instrument or similar agreement which has the purpose or effect of reducing the shareholder's full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares and/or hedging, offsetting or altering the gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares. 
A shareholder will be deemed to "own" outstanding common shares that have been loaned by or on behalf of the shareholder to another person if the shareholder has the right to recall such loaned shares on not more than five business days' notice. 
Number of Shareholder Nominees 
The maximum number of candidates nominated by all eligible shareholders that the Company would be required to include in its proxy materials cannot exceed the greater of two candidates or 20 percent (rounded down) of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which a notice of proxy access nomination may be delivered to the Company. The maximum number of shareholder nominees would be reduced by candidates nominated under proxy access procedures who (i) have subsequently withdrawn or who become unwilling to serve, (ii) cease to satisfy certain eligibility requirements, (iii) are included in the Company's proxy statement as a nominee of the Board, (iv) are nominated by the Board pursuant to an agreement or other arrangement with one or more shareholders, or (v) were previously elected to the Board as shareholder nominees at any of the last two preceding annual general meetings and renominated as a director by the Board. 
Nominating Procedure 
In order to provide adequate time to assess shareholder nominees, requests to include shareholder nominees in the Company's proxy materials must be delivered not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the date the Company mailed its proxy statement for the prior year's annual general meeting to shareholders. 
Information and Undertakings Required of All Nominating Shareholders and Nominees 
Each shareholder seeking to include a shareholder nominee in the Company's proxy materials would be required to provide certain information, representations and undertakings to the Company regarding the nominating shareholder (including all members of the group) and each shareholder nominee, including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● verification of the shareholders continuous qualifying ownership of the Companys common shares as of the date  of the submission of the nomination, and agreement to provide written statements verifying continuous qualifying ownership through the record date for the applicable annual general meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● information regarding each candidate, including biographical and share ownership information; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● information as to whether a nominee is or has been a director or officer of a competitor and on any other relationship with  or financial interest in any competitor within the preceding three years.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, each shareholder nominee requested to be included in the Company's proxy materials would be required to provide certain written representations and undertakings to the Company,   including agreeing that, if elected as a director, the shareholder nominee will comply with all of the Company's corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, share ownership and trading policies and guidelines, and other Company policies and guidelines applicable to directors. 
No Proxy Access Nominees in the Event of Proxy Contest or Legal Violations 
The Company would not be required to include a shareholder nominee in its proxy materials if, among other things, any shareholder nominates a person for election pursuant to the advance notice provisions of the Company's bye-laws, or the nomination or election of the nominee would cause the Company to violate its bye-laws, applicable laws or the rules or the rules and listing standards of the principal exchange upon which the Company's shares are listed. 
Future Disqualification of Shareholder Nominees 
Any nominee who is included in the Company's proxy materials but subsequently either withdraws from or becomes ineligible for election at the meeting, or does not receive at least 25 percent of the votes cast in favor of his or her election, would be ineligible for nomination for the next two annual general meetings. 
Supporting Statement 
Shareholders would be permitted to include in the Company's proxy statement for the applicable annual general meeting a written statement of up to 500 words in support of the election of their nominees. The Company would be permitted to omit any information or statement that the Company determines is materially false or misleading or whose disclosure would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
Conforming Amendments 
The bye-laws also make clear that the Board may remove any director for a material breach of any of the Company's corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, share ownership or trading policies and guidelines, or any other Company policies or guidelines applicable to directors. 
Amendment to Bye-Law 38 
Bye-law 38 was amended in 2018 to phase out our classified board as part of our plan to adopt majority voting and implement a "proxy access" bye-law. The proposed amendments correct a transcription error in the transition terms of Class II and III directors set forth in Bye-law 38 to conform to the correct terms set forth in the proxy disclosure for the proposal in the 2018 proxy statement that was approved by shareholders. The Class II director term is meant to expire in 2019 (as stated in the 2018 proxy disclosure, whereas the bye-law incorrectly had a transcription error of 2020). The Class III director term is meant to expire in 2020 (as stated in the 2018 proxy disclosure, whereas the bye-law incorrectly had a transcription error of 2019). The proposed amendments would conform the bye-law to the 2018 proxy disclosure so that Class II Directors shall hold office until the annual general meeting held in 2019 and Class III Directors shall hold office until the annual general meeting held in 2020. In addition, the proposed amendments make certain other immaterial changes, including revising certain defined terms. 
If this proposal is approved, the amendments to our bye-laws will become effective immediately following the Annual Meeting.  Vote Required and Recommendation 
Approval of Proposal 4 will require the affirmative vote of not less than 66-2/3 percent of the votes attaching to all shares in issue. 
With respect to Proposal 4, you may instruct your vote "for," or "against," or "abstain" from voting. If you "abstain" from voting, your vote will have the same effect as a vote "against" such proposal. If you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 4, your broker or nominee will not be entitled to cast votes and a "broker non-vote" on Proposal 4 will result. Broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will have the same effect as a vote "against" such proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE 
AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S BYE-LAWS TO IMPLEMENT PROXY ACCESS AND THE RELATED CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of 12 members, divided into three classes. Our bye-laws were amended and restated in 2018 to eliminate the classified structure of our Board over a three-year period and provide that all director nominees standing for election upon completion of their term after the 2018 annual general meeting would be elected to a one-year term. Each of our directors will continue to serve as director until the end of his or her term, or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation, or removal. Under Bermuda law and our bye-laws, any incumbent director who fails to be re-elected to the Board may not continue to sit on the Board after his or her term in office has expired. If any director positions are left vacant following a general meeting of shareholders, the Board may reduce its size or, if authorized by shareholders, may fill such vacant positions. Our shareholders have not authorized the Board to fill positions on the Board left vacant following a general meeting of shareholders. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board of Directors of IHS Markit believes strongly in the value of an independent board of directors to provide effective oversight of management. This includes all independent members of the key board committees: the Audit Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Risk Committee. Each of the Company's directors, other than Mr. Uggla, is independent (see "—Independent Directors"). The independent members of the Board of Directors meet regularly without management, which meetings are chaired by the lead independent director, which our bye-laws refer to as the Lead Director, whose role is described further below. 
The Board believes that it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") in any way that it deems to be in the best interests of the Company. Upon the retirement of Jerre Stead as Chairman and CEO on December 31, 2017, Lance Uggla became our Chairman and CEO as was set out in our bye-laws. Prior to the Merger, Mr. Uggla was Chairman and CEO of Markit. Mr. Uggla possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the business and the opportunities we have in the global marketplace and is thus well positioned to develop agendas and lead the Board to ensure that the Board's time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. 
IHS Markit has established a Lead Director role with broad authority and responsibility. Robert P. Kelly has served as our Lead Director since the closing of the Merger and was previously the lead director of Markit beginning in June 2014. The Lead Director's responsibilities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● scheduling and chairing meetings of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● serving as principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and CEO on sensitive issues;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● communicating from time to time with the Chairman and CEO, and disseminating information among the Board as appropriate;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● providing leadership to the Board if circumstances arise in which the role of the Chairman may be, or may be perceived to  be, in conflict;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviewing and approving the agenda and schedule for Board meetings and executive sessions and adding topics to the agenda  as appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviewing the quality, quantity, and timeliness of information to be provided to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● serving as a nonmanagement point of contact for the Companys shareholders and other external stakeholders; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● with the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, preside over the annual self-evaluation of the Board.   
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that these responsibilities appropriately and effectively complement the Board leadership structure of IHS Markit. 
The Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Oversight 
We believe that risk is inherent in innovation and the pursuit of long-term growth opportunities for our business. The Board of Directors, acting directly and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of the Company's risk management. With the oversight of the Board, IHS Markit has implemented practices and programs designed to help manage the risks to which we are exposed in our business and to align risk-taking appropriately with our efforts to increase shareholder value. Each of the Audit, Human Resources, and Risk Committees of the Board has a role in assisting the Board in its oversight of the Company's risk management, as set forth in the relevant committee charters. 
The Board's Risk Committee brings additional Board-level focus to the oversight of the Company's management of key risks, as well as the Company's policies and processes for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating such risks. The Risk Committee meets at least quarterly. The Chair of the Risk Committee gives regular reports of the Risk Committee's meetings and activities to the Board in order to keep the Board informed of the Company's guidelines, policies, and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, and each other committee also reports regularly to the full Board on its activities. 
In addition, the Board of Directors participates in regular discussions among the Board and with IHS Markit senior management on many core subjects, including strategy, operations, finance, information technology, information and cybersecurity, human resources, legal, compliance, and public policy matters, and any other subjects regarding which the Board or its committees consider risk oversight an inherent element. Management at IHS Markit is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities. The Company has formed a management risk committee led by a Chief Risk Officer to supervise these day-to-day risk management efforts, including identifying potential material risks and appropriate and reasonable risk mitigation efforts. The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports such efforts to the Risk Committee and, as required, the Audit Committee and Human Resources Committee. The Board of Directors believes that the leadership structure described under "—Board Leadership Structure" facilitates the Board's oversight of risk management because it allows the Board, with leadership from the Lead Director and working through its independent committees, to participate actively in the oversight of management's actions. 
Shareholder Engagement 
Engagement with our shareholders has always been a significant priority for us, and we invest focused time and resources speaking with shareholders and proxy advisors about our corporate governance and executive compensation practices. 
As we have done in the past, in 2018 we reached out to the governance leaders and stewardship teams of shareholders representing at that time approximately 50 percent of our common shares outstanding. We asked for feedback on our performance and practices, particularly related to corporate   governance and pay practices. We offered to visit in person or meet by teleconference. In response to our outreach efforts, we conducted meetings with several of our top shareholders via teleconference or in person. Those meetings were attended at various times by our Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel and Head of Investor Relations. 
We discussed a range of topics at those meetings, including the board structure and composition, corporate governance practices, executive compensation policies and design, and environmental-, social-, and governance-related matters. Shareholders were generally supportive of our current practices. We took the feedback that we received to our Nominating and Governance Committee and Human Resources Committee. Both committees, as well as the entire Board, find shareholder input valuable in their oversight of the Company. 
As a result of our shareholder engagement, we have made a number of changes to our governance practices and disclosure: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In Proposal 4, we are asking shareholders to vote on amendments to our bye-laws  that would implement proxy access and allow eligible shareholders to include their nominees for election to the Board in the Companys proxy materials, along with the candidates nominated by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In January 2019, we amended and restated our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan to prohibit the repricing of outstanding  options and share appreciation rights such that we cannot reduce their exercise price without shareholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In October 2018, we announced the launch of a board mentorship program designed to build the ranks of female candidates for  board directorships. We have committed to increase the percentage of female independent directors on our Board to at least 30 percent by 2021.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In January 2018, we added two new directors, increasing gender and sexual orientation diversity, and refreshed the  composition of our Board committees to continue to provide our Board with fresh insights.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For the last few years, we have had discussions with certain shareholders about annual equity award dilution and we are  actively managing our annual run rate share usage. For 2019, we are again committed to limiting our annual equity award dilution to a maximum annual run rate of 1.00 percent of total common shares outstanding.  
[END TABLE]
For more information on changes we made to our compensation governance practices and disclosure, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Shareholder Engagement" 
Shareholder engagement is and will continue to be a top priority for our management team and Board. We will continue to engage our shareholders and consider the feedback that we receive from our discussions. 
Business Experience and Qualifications of Board Members 
The following discussion presents information about the persons who compose the Board of Directors of IHS Markit, including the four nominees for election at the Annual Meeting. On February 13, 2019, Mr. Iyer informed the Board that, after 16 years of service on the Board, he had decided to retire from the Board, and he tendered his resignation as a Class III director of the Board and its committees effective as of the end of the day on April 11, 2019, the date of the Annual Meeting. Mr. Iyer confirmed that his decision to retire was not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter related to the Company's operations, policies or practices. The Board expects to reduce its size to 11 directors upon Mr. Iyer's retirement and will make a final determination at its April meeting after the Annual Meeting.  All director biographical information is as of February 1, 2019, except for the age of the directors, which is as of the date of the Annual Meeting. We measure director tenure from when a director joined the Board or the board of either IHS or Markit (or their relevant predecessor companies) prior to the Merger.

 Organization of the Board of Directors 
Upon completion of the Merger, in accordance with our bye-laws, the Board size was set at 11 directors, six of whom were designees of IHS (each, an "IHS designee") and five of whom were designees of Markit (each, a "Markit designee"). As such, as of the completion of the Merger on July 12, 2016, Edwin D. Cass, Gillian H. Denham, Timothy J.A. Frost, Cheng Chih Sung, Anne Walker and Lance Uggla resigned as directors of IHS Markit, and the remaining members of the Board, William E. Ford, Dinyar S. Devitre, Robert P. Kelly, and James A. Rosenthal, as the Markit designees, appointed Lance Uggla as a Class II director and Markit designee, and the following IHS designees to serve as directors of IHS Markit: Jerre L. Stead and Deborah Doyle McWhinney as Class I directors, Richard W. Roedel and Jean-Paul L. Montupet as Class II directors, and Ruann F. Ernst and Balakrishnan S. Iyer as Class III directors. 
In addition, Mr. Stead became Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit, Mr. Uggla became President, Chief Integration Officer, and Chief Operating Officer of IHS Markit and Robert P. Kelly became the Lead Director of the Board. Pursuant to our bye-laws, Mr. Stead served as Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit from the completion of the Merger until his retirement from the Company on December 31, 2017 (the "change date"), when Mr. Uggla was appointed Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit. 
In October 2017, the Board unanimously approved keeping the size of the Board at 11 directors as of the change date and appointed Lord Browne as a Class III director effective as of January 1, 2018. In December 2017, the Board unanimously approved increasing the size of the Board to 12 directors effective as of January 1, 2018 and appointing Ms. Giadrossi as a Class I director effective as of that date. 
Our Board held six meetings during 2018. At each meeting, the Chairman was the presiding director. Each director attended at least 75 percent of the total regularly scheduled and special meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served. As stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board encourages each director to attend our annual general meeting of shareholders. At the 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, all 12 directors were in attendance. 
Our Board has established four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Risk Committee. The Board has approved a charter for each of the Audit, Human Resources, Nominating and Governance, and Risk Committees, which can be found on our website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com. 
In Markit's initial public offering in 2014, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board ("CPPIB") purchased approximately $250 million of our common shares, and was given the right to nominate, in consultation with our Nominating and Governance Committee, one director for appointment to our Board of Directors pursuant to a Director Nomination Agreement with us. This right will expire if CPPIB's beneficial ownership of our common shares falls below 100 percent of the number of common shares CPPIB purchased in Markit's initial public offering. Edwin D. Cass was the designee nominated by CPPIB and was appointed to Markit's Board of Directors in October 2014. At the completion of the Merger, Mr. Cass resigned and CPPIB determined at that time that it would not choose to designate a new nominee to our Board, reserving the right to designate a future nominee in accordance with the terms of the Director Nomination Agreement.  Independent Directors 
We have determined that all of our directors other than Mr. Uggla are independent directors, based on the independence standards of NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations. 
In addition, we believe that all members of each of the Audit Committee, Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board meet the independence standards of NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations. 
In accordance with our bye-laws and the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors designated Mr. Kelly as Lead Director in April 2018. The Lead Director chairs executive sessions of the independent directors. During 2018, the independent directors of the Board met five times without the presence of management. In addition, each committee of the Board met in executive session without the presence of management four times during 2018. 
Simultaneous Service on Other Public Company Boards 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, without the consent of the Nominating and Governance Committee, a director may not serve on more than five public company boards, including our Board, and a director who is also the chief executive officer of another public company may not serve on more than two public company boards, including our Board and their own board of directors. 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that a director must notify the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee prior to accepting any invitation to serve on another board (including a not-for-profit/tax-exempt board) or with a government or advisory group that is expected to require significant commitments of time, in order for IHS Markit to confirm the absence of any actual or potential conflict of interest. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that serve as a framework within which our Board and its committees operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas including the size and composition of our Board of Directors, membership criteria and director qualifications, director responsibilities, Board agenda, roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and lead independent director, meetings of independent directors, committee responsibilities and assignments, Board member access to management and independent advisers, director communications with third parties, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, evaluation of senior management and management succession planning. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com. 
Business Code of Conduct 
We have adopted a code of ethics that we refer to as our Business Code of Conduct. Our Business Code of Conduct applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. 
Our Business Code of Conduct is available on our website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com. If we approve any substantive amendment to our Business Code of Conduct, or if we grant any waiver of our Business Code of Conduct to our directors or executive officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), we will post an update on the   Investor Relations page of our website (http://investor.ihsmarkit.com) within four business days following the date of the amendment or waiver, describing the nature and date of the amendment or the nature of the waiver, the name of the person to whom it was granted and the date of the waiver, as the case may be. 
Board and Committee Evaluations 
Each year, our Board and its committees perform a rigorous self-evaluation. As required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees this process. The performance evaluations solicit input from directors regarding the performance and effectiveness of the Board and the Board committees, and provide an opportunity for members of the Board to identify areas for improvement. In addition, the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Lead Director have individual conversations with each member of the Board, providing further opportunity for dialogue and improvement, including with respect to board refreshment in light of the current challenges and needs of the Board and the Company. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the results and feedback from the evaluation process and makes recommendations. Each committee also reviews the results and feedback from the evaluation process with respect to that committee. The Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee leads a discussion of the evaluation results during an executive session of the Board and communicates relevant feedback to our CEO. Our Board has successfully used this process to evaluate Board and committee effectiveness and identify opportunities to strengthen the Board. 
Consideration of Diversity and Experience 
Although the Board has not set specific goals with respect to diversity and has no formal policy, it believes the Board's membership should be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills and an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience and capability. The Nominating and Governance Committee selects candidates for director based on the candidate's character, judgment, diversity of experience, business acumen, and ability to act on behalf of all shareholders (without regard to whether the candidate has been nominated by a shareholder). The Nominating and Governance Committee considers not only an individual's qualities, performance and professional responsibilities, but also the current composition of the Board, the challenges and needs of the Board at any particular time, and the needs of the Company under applicable rules and regulations. Consistent with this philosophy, in addition to the criteria set forth above, the Nominating and Governance Committee is committed to including women and minority candidates in the pool of qualified candidates from which Board nominees are chosen. 
Board succession planning is an ongoing, year-round process. The Board recognizes that it is important for the Board to balance the benefits of continuity with the benefits of fresh viewpoints and experience. While it is not the policy of the Board to identify specific term limits or a specific mandatory retirement age for directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board and the appropriateness of each director's continued service on the Board in light of the current challenges and needs of the Board and the Company, and determines whether it may be appropriate to add directors after considering issues of judgment, diversity (including gender, nationality, geography and race/ethnicity), age, tenure, skills, background and experience and other factors deemed appropriate by the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board also addresses diversity as part of its consideration of the Board's composition in its annual self-evaluation process.   The Board believes the current composition of the Board and mix of tenures provides for a highly effective and well-functioning Board. As of the date of the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The average tenure of the members of the Board is approximately 8.3 years (the average tenure for independent directors is  7.6 years), when measuring tenure from when the director joined the Board or the board of either IHS or Markit prior to the Merger;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Three of our independent directors have tenure of less than five years, five independent directors have tenure between five  and 10 years and three independent directors have tenure of more than 10 years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Three of our 11 independent directors are female;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Two directors are of South Asian descent; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● One director is openly gay.  
[END TABLE]
The Board also believes that it is important to support diversity in corporate boardrooms, and to that end, it launched a board mentorship program in 2018 designed to build the ranks of female candidates for board directorships. During the program, participants act as non-voting observer members of the Board and are expected to take an active part in all discussions. Existing board members mentor participants throughout the mentorship. 
Communications with the Board or Independent Directors 
The Board has a process for shareholders or any interested party to send communications to the Board, including any committee of the Board, any individual director, or our independent directors as a group. If you wish to communicate with the Board as a whole, with any committee of the Board, with one or more individual directors, or with our independent directors as a group, you may send your written communication to: 
Lead Director c/o General Counsel 
IHS Markit Ltd. 
4th Floor, Ropemaker Place 
25 Ropemaker Street 
London EC2Y 9LY 
United Kingdom 
Depending on how the communication is addressed and the subject matter of the communication, our Lead Director, with the assistance of our General Counsel, will review any communication received and will forward the communication to the appropriate director or directors. 
Communications with the Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee has established a process for communicating complaints regarding accounting or auditing matters. In order to submit such a complaint, you may call our compliance hotline as set forth in the Compliance Hotline and Reporting Misconduct Policy, which can be found on our website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com. Any such complaints received or submitted are forwarded as appropriate to the Audit Committee, to take such action as may be appropriate.  Composition of Board Committees 
The Board reviews the composition of our Board committees and considers the expertise of the directors with the needs of the committees. The Board had four standing committees, with membership and number of meetings for each as of 2018 fiscal year-end as shown below.

Current Members:

Deborah Doyle McWhinney 
Richard W. Roedel (Chair) 
James A. Rosenthal 
The Risk Committee has been established by our Board to assist our Board in its oversight of the Company's risk management. In addition to any other responsibilities which may be assigned from time to time by the Board, the Risk Committee is responsible for (i) reviewing and discussing with management the Company's risk management and risk assessment processes, including any policies and procedures for the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of major risks of the Company, (ii) receiving periodic reports from management as to efforts to monitor, control, and mitigate major risks, (iii) reviewing periodic reports from management pertaining to the Company's business lines, products, and services, including any major risks with respect to such business lines, products, and services, as the Risk Committee deems appropriate, (iv) reviewing periodic reports from management pertaining to cybersecurity programs and data protection controls and such other appropriate information security reports as the Risk Committee deems appropriate, (v) reviewing and discussing with management the Company's compliance with laws and regulations, including major legal and regulatory initiatives, (vi) reviewing periodic reports from management pertaining to corporate sustainability strategy and initiatives, (vii) reviewing any material complaints received pursuant to the Company's code of conduct hotline policy (other than complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, which are reviewed by the Audit Committee), (viii) reviewing periodic reports from management on selected risk topics as the Risk Committee deems appropriate from time to time encompassing major risks other than those delegated by the Board to other committees of the Board in their respective charters or otherwise, and (ix) assigning for review to other committees of the Board such selected risk topics identified by the Risk Committee as the Risk Committee determines is appropriate for effective oversight of such risks. The Risk Committee is governed by a charter, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com. 
Our Board has determined that each member of the Risk Committee satisfies the "independence" requirement of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Risk Committee Charter. 
Director Nominations 
Our Board nominates directors to be elected at each annual general meeting of shareholders and appoints new directors to fill vacancies when they arise. The Nominating and Governance Committee has the responsibility to identify, evaluate, recruit, and recommend qualified candidates to the Board for nomination or appointment.  In addition to considering an appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, and capability, the Board has as an objective that its membership be composed of experienced and dedicated individuals with diversity of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The Nominating and Governance Committee will select candidates for director based on the candidate's character, judgment, diversity (including gender nationality and ethnicity), age, tenure, skills, background and experience, business acumen, and ability to act on behalf of all shareholders (without regard to whether the candidate has been nominated by a shareholder). The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that nominees for director should have experience, such as experience in management or accounting and finance, or industry and technology knowledge, that may be useful to IHS Markit and the Board, high personal and professional ethics, and the willingness and ability to devote sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties as a director. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes it appropriate for at least one, and preferably multiple, members of the Board to meet the criteria established by the SEC for an "audit committee financial expert," and for a majority of the members of the Board to meet the definition of "independent director" under the rules of NASDAQ. Consistent with this philosophy, in addition to the criteria set forth above, the Nominating and Governance Committee is committed to including women and minority candidates in the pool of qualified candidates from which Board nominees are chosen. The Nominating and Governance Committee also believes it may be appropriate for certain key members of our management to participate as members of the Board. 
Prior to each annual general meeting of shareholders, the Nominating and Governance Committee identifies nominees first by evaluating the current directors whose terms will expire at the annual general meeting of shareholders and who are willing to continue in service. These candidates are evaluated based on the criteria described above, the candidate's prior service as a director, and the needs of the Board with respect to the particular talents and experience of its directors. In the event that a director does not wish to continue his or her service, the Nominating and Governance Committee determines not to renominate the director, or a vacancy is created on the Board as a result of a resignation, an increase in the size of the Board, or other event, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider various candidates for membership, including those suggested by the Nominating and Governance Committee members, by other Board members, by any executive search firm engaged by the Nominating and Governance Committee, or by any nomination properly submitted by a shareholder pursuant to the procedures for shareholder nominations for directors provided in the proxy statement related to the Annual General Meeting and this annual report. As a matter of policy, candidates recommended by shareholders are evaluated on the same basis as candidates recommended by the Board members, executive search firms, or other sources. In 2018, the Nominating and Governance Committee did not engage any executive search firms to assist with identifying qualified Board candidates. 
Mr. Montupet, Mr. Roedel and Mr. Uggla are new nominees for election to the Board this year. Their nominations were recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee and approved by the Board. Mr. Montupet and Mr. Roedel were formerly on the IHS Inc. board of directors and were appointed by the Board in July 2016 to serve on our Board as IHS designees. Mr. Uggla is our Chairman and CEO, and was formerly on the Markit Ltd. board of directors and was reappointed by the Board in July 2016 to serve on our Board as a Markit designee. 
Director Share Ownership Guidelines 
We believe that our non-employee directors should have a significant equity interest in the Company. Our Board has adopted an ownership policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that requires   directors to hold common shares with an aggregate value of at least five times the Board's annual cash retainer. Vested stock options which are not exercised are not considered for the purposes of director equity ownership. Directors have five years to achieve the holding requirement. 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our current directors held shares in excess of their holding requirement except for Mr. Rosenthal, who has until June 2019 to meet his holding requirement, and Lord Browne and Ms. Giadrossi, who each have until December 2023 to meet their holding requirement. Prior to the Merger, Mr. Rosenthal declined to receive director compensation as a member of the Markit board. 
Hedging and Pledging Policy 
We have a hedging and pledging policy for executive officers and directors in our policy on trading securities that (i) prohibits them from engaging in any hedging transactions that are designed to hedge or speculate on any change in the market value of IHS Markit equity securities and (ii) requires prior approval from the Nominating and Governance Committee before allowing them to hold IHS Markit securities in margin accounts or pledge IHS Markit securities as collateral. 
Director Compensation 
Our non-employee directors receive compensation for their service on our Board. The objective of our program is to provide non-employee directors compensation that is straightforward, market- competitive and consistent with current peer pay levels, and that provides flexibility for income deferrals. The compensation is composed of cash retainers and equity awards. In addition, each of our non-employee directors is reimbursed for reasonable expenses related to meeting attendance and activities related to their duties as directors. The following table sets forth information concerning the non-employee director compensation program in effect at the 2018 fiscal year-end. We believe it is important that non-employee directors build up a significant holding in our common shares to align their interests with those of shareholders. The non-employee directors are required to hold five times their annual board retainer and have five years within which to comply with this holding requirement.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The shares underlying the annual equity award value are determined by dividing the value on the grant date by the closing  price of our common shares on the grant date. On the day of the Company's annual general meeting of shareholders each year, each non-employee director shall receive an award consisting of restricted share  units whose underlying shares shall have, on the date of grant, a fair market value equal to $180,000. Such awards will vest one year from the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
Non-employee director compensation is reviewed annually by the Nominating and Governance Committee, with the assistance of the Human Resources Committee and Pay Governance LLC, the committees' independent compensation consultant. The Nominating and Governance Committee makes recommendations about non-employee director compensation to our Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee's most recent review of non-employee director compensation was in July 2018 and determined that no changes were required to be recommended to the Board.  All equity awards for non-employee directors are determined by the Non-employee Director Equity Compensation Policy and issued pursuant to our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan. Non-employee directors may elect to defer their cash retainers to deferred share units. In 2018, six non-employee directors elected to defer their cash retainers to deferred share units. 
Our bye-laws provide that the Company shall indemnify its officers and directors in respect of their actions and omissions, except in cases of fraud or dishonesty, and that the Company shall advance funds to its officers and directors for expenses incurred in their defense on the condition that they will repay the funds if any allegation of fraud or dishonesty is proved. 
In addition, the Company has entered into agreements with its officers and directors to indemnify them against expenses and liabilities to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
We also have purchased and maintain a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for the benefit of any officer or director in respect of any loss or liability attaching to him or her in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, whether or not we may otherwise indemnify such officer or director. 
Director Compensation During 2018 
The following table sets forth information concerning the compensation of each of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year, which began December 1, 2017 and ended November 30, 2018. Non-employee directors did not receive any stock options, non-equity incentive plan compensation, or any other compensation that is not otherwise disclosed in the table below. Non-employee directors do not participate in defined benefit and actuarial pension plans or nonqualified defined contribution plans. In addition, non-employee directors may choose to defer receipt of the shares underlying the restricted share units (i) until after their termination of service in the case of the annual equity award and (ii) until after their termination of service or three years after the year in which the compensation was earned in the case of the cash retainers.

The following table sets forth certain information as of February 14, 2019, unless otherwise noted, as to common shares beneficially owned by (i) each person who is known by us to own beneficially more than five percent of our common shares, (ii) each of our named executive officers listed in "Table 1. 2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "Executive Compensation Tables," (iii) each of our directors, and (iv) all our directors and executive officers as a group. 
The percentage of common shares beneficially owned is based on 424,625,307 common shares issued and outstanding as of February 14, 2019, the Record Date. We have only one class of shares issued and outstanding, that being common shares, and all holders of our common shares have the same voting rights. Solely for purposes of the following table and accompanying footnotes relating to beneficial ownership of our common shares, the number of common shares issued and outstanding as of the Record Date includes 25,219,470 common shares held by the EBT as further described in footnote 19 to the table below and under "—Employee Benefit Trust." 
In accordance with SEC rules, "beneficial ownership" includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.  For purposes of this table, beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance with the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act under which, in general, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security if he or she has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose of or direct the disposition of the security, or if he or she has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of the security within 60 days of February 14, 2019. To our knowledge, except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, the persons named in the table each have sole voting and investment power with respect to all common shares beneficially owned by them. We do not know of any arrangements which would result in a change in our control.

 Employee Benefit Trust 
The Markit Group Holdings Limited Employee Benefit Trust (the "EBT") is a discretionary trust established by a deed dated January 27, 2010 between Markit Group Holdings Limited and Intertrust Employee Benefit Trustee Limited (the "trustee"), as trustee of the EBT, through which shares and other benefits may be provided to IHS Markit's existing and former employees in satisfaction of their rights under any compensation or share incentive arrangements established by IHS Markit. The trustee is an independent provider of fiduciary services based in Jersey, Channel Islands. The EBT will terminate on January 27, 2090, unless terminated earlier by the trustee. 
No current or former employee has the right to receive any benefit from the EBT unless and until the trustee exercises its discretion to confer a benefit. Neither IHS Markit nor any of its subsidiaries is permitted to be a beneficiary of the EBT. Subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion, shares held by the EBT may be delivered to such employees in satisfaction of their rights under any share incentive arrangements established by IHS Markit. We may make nonbinding recommendations to the trustee regarding the EBT. 
The Trustee may amend the EBT, subject to our consent, but not in any manner that would confer on IHS Markit any benefit or possibility of benefit. The principal activity of the EBT has been to acquire shares in IHS Markit from its existing and former employees and to hold such shares for their benefit. Unless we direct otherwise, the trustee of the EBT may not vote any of the common shares held by the EBT and is also generally obliged to forgo dividends. See "Information Concerning Proxy Solicitation and Voting—Who Can Vote." 
We have historically funded the EBT's acquisition of common shares through interest-free loans that are repayable on demand, but without recourse to any assets other than those held by the trustee in its capacity as trustee of the EBT.  SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
For 2018, the officers and directors of IHS Markit voluntarily complied with the rules of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act that require ownership reports to be filed on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with the SEC. 
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we have received and written representations from our executive officers and directors that they filed all applicable reports, we believe that, in 2018, all filings required by officers and directors under Section 16(a) were filed on a timely basis, except for one late Form 4 due to inadvertent administrative oversight by James A. Rosenthal, who purchased 1,000 common shares.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The following report of the Audit Committee does not constitute "soliciting material" and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by IHS Markit under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act. 
The Audit Committee provides assistance to the Board in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving the Company's accounting, auditing, financial reporting, internal control, and legal compliance functions by approving the services performed by the Company's independent registered public accountants and reviewing their reports regarding the Company's accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls as set forth in a written charter adopted by the Board. The Company's management is responsible for preparing the Company's financial statements. The independent registered public accountants are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities by the Company's management and the independent registered public accountants. 
To fulfill that responsibility, the Audit Committee has regularly met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accountants. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accountants matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
As part of that review, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Company and its management, including any matters in those written disclosures. Additionally, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining such accountants' independence. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with internal accountants and independent registered public accountants, with and without management present, its evaluations of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants referred to above, the Audit Committee approved and recommended to the Board the inclusion of the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 in the IHS Markit Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC. 
Respectfully submitted by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors: 
Mr. Dinyar S. Devitre, Chair 
Ms. Nicoletta Giadrossi 
Mr. Balakrishnan S. Iyer 
Ms. Deborah Doyle McWhinney 
Mr. Richard W. Roedel  REPORT OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE 
The Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with Company management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. 
Based on such review and discussion, the Human Resources Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement. 
Respectfully submitted by the members of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors: 
Mr. William E. Ford, Chair 
John Browne (The Lord Browne of Madingley) 
Mr. Robert P. Kelly 
Mr. Jean-Paul L. Montupet 
Mr. James A. Rosenthal 
The foregoing report of the Human Resources Committee does not constitute "soliciting material" and shall not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by IHS Markit under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
On behalf of the Human Resources Committee (the "HR Committee") of the Board, I am pleased to present the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (the "CD&A") for the Company's fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. 
The CD&A reviews the Company's business performance for the year and the annual compensation of our named executive officers for achieving those performance levels. The key decisions made by the HR Committee over the year are also discussed, as well as amendments made to our 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan. 
William E. Ford 
Chair of the Human Resources Committee 
Overview 
The CD&A reviews the Company's business performance for the year and the annual compensation of our named executive officers for achieving those performance levels. It also provides an overview and analysis of our compensation programs and policies, material compensation decisions made during 2018 under those programs and policies, and the material factors considered in making those decisions. 
For the second full year since our Merger in 2016, we have continued to deliver robust results to create strong value for shareholders. Our share price increased from $44.62 per share on November 30, 2017 to $53.37 per share on November 30, 2018, delivering strong 2018 shareholder return of approximately 20 percent, as discussed further under "—Financial Performance and Compensation in 2018." 
The Company's compensation programs are objective and performance-based, and the Company has adopted practices that minimize material risk to shareholders. 
Our executive officers have a compensation program that includes (a) a competitive base salary, (b) an annual cash incentive tied to pre-established financial goals, and (c) long-term equity incentives also tied to pre-established financial goals aimed to motivate and retain executives while driving the long-term performance of the Company. 
Until November 30, 2017, the Company qualified as a foreign private issuer (as defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act). Effective December 1, 2017, the Company no longer qualified as a foreign private issuer and is now subject to the informational requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including with respect to compensation disclosure. 
Financial Performance and Compensation in 2018 
How did We Perform in the Year? 
We had a strong year in 2018, achieving significant financial, operational and strategic results.  The integration of IHS and Markit is now complete, and our diversity across verticals, geographies, and customers will allow us to perform well in the coming years under a wide range of market conditions. We believe our content coupled with our deep industry expertise gives us a long-term competitive advantage. 
We achieved 6 percent organic growth, expanded Adjusted EBITDA Margin, grew net income and Adjusted EPS by double digits, and delivered approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow. We also enhanced our product suite organically and through the acquisition of Ipreo, putting us in a strong position entering 2019. 
We made continued strides against our strategic initiatives focusing on technology and products, our customers, and our people, which will help us continue to deliver against our longer-term financial goals. We made significant progress in leveraging our advanced analytics capabilities across our core data assets to assist our customers in their decision-making, including improved asset valuations and new benchmarking services across our segments. 
We delivered strong financial results in 2018 across each of our business segments. 
Our Transportation segment reported a very strong year with organic revenue growth of 11 percent. The division was led by our Automotive businesses, which continue to be a major growth driver. We also made significant operational improvements across Aerospace & Defense and Maritime & Trade. We launched and developed several new products, including a new freight rate forecasting service and the tracking of commodities at sea. We have developed a number of successful proofs of concept around security events analysis and automotive forecasting, both of which will bode well for future revenues. Additionally, we integrated automotiveMastermind, and developed our Conquest marketing product, which helps car dealers and manufacturers win new customers. 
In our Resources segment, we delivered solid organic revenue growth of 4 percent for the full year. This was supported by our upstream business which returned to growth, while our midstream and downstream businesses maintained strong performance. We ended the year in line with our expectations, supporting our view of a continued improvement for Resources in 2019. 
Throughout 2018, we launched several new products, including an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) registry, a mobility service, and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) analytics. We had a record CERAweek with increased participation from the broader IHS Markit areas of expertise. We also formed a new team to grow business with financial and capital markets customers across all of our Resources businesses. 
Our Financial Services segment had a strong year, delivering 6 percent organic revenue growth. We accomplished a lot across the segment, including the acquisition of Ipreo, which has additionally broadened our reach across large and growing private capital markets. The cost and revenue synergies of this transaction are tracking in line with expectations, and we have closed multiple joint transactions already. We continue to see growth from investments in innovation within our derivatives pricing and valuations businesses. We have advanced partnerships with third parties across Financial Services to provide best-in-class solutions for our customers, with particular progress in liquidity analytics, collateral management, and initial margin calculations. 
Finally, within our Consolidated Markets & Solutions (CMS) segment, we reported organic revenue growth of 3 percent, normalized for the biennial Boiler Pressure Vessel Code. We believe our leadership changes coupled with key investments will allow us to capture an increasing share of   market opportunities, driving steady growth in years to come. Product Design rebounded as the fundamentals for its oil and gas customers improved. Technology, Media & Telecom expanded its performance benchmarking capabilities to include a broad range of electronics, including semiconductor chipsets, gaming platforms, and the Internet of Things. Our Economics and Country Risk teams experienced strong demand while helping our customers better understand the implications of new trade tariffs, and how these tariffs impact the global economy and individual companies. 
There is strong momentum running through the business. We are confident that we are well-positioned to sustain this level of growth over the coming years as we look to advance our financial, operational and strategic goals.

(1)  Net income attributable to IHS Markit for the year ended November 30, 2018 includes a  one-time tax benefit associated with U.S. tax reform estimated at approximately $141 million.  
[END TABLE]
Throughout this CD&A, we refer to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. These are non-GAAP financial measures used to supplement our financial statements which are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). For a definition and discussion of these measures, see "—Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." We also refer to Revenue, which is a GAAP financial measure. Unless otherwise stated or the context requires, all references to Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS refer to corporate Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. 
How is Executive Officer Compensation Linked to Company Performance? 
The chart below shows IHS Markit's annual Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") performance against the S&P 500 Index since our initial public offering on June 19, 2014. The S&P 500 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured, as it is widely used and understood, and IHS Markit is a constituent of the index. 
As shown below, our TSR since our initial public offering was 29 percent higher than the S&P 500 Index during the same period. A $100 investment made on June 19, 2014 in our common shares would have been worth approximately $200 as of November 30, 2018, whereas the same investment in the S&P 500 Index would have been worth approximately $154.  TSR represents the cumulative share price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends on the ex-dividend date. Because Markit became the public combined group holding company and was considered the legal acquirer in the Merger, these shareholder return calculations are based on the beginning value of Markit common shares pre-Merger and IHS Markit common shares following the Merger. 
For 2018, our TSR grew 20 percent, which was 13 percent higher than the S&P 500 Index. A $100 investment made on December 1, 2017 in our common shares would have been worth approximately $120 as of November 30, 2018, whereas the same investment in the S&P 500 Index would have been worth approximately $106.  Leadership Structure 
Our executive officers have continued to deliver strong growth in their respective operations since the Merger. Mr. Stead, former Chairman and CEO of IHS, served as our Chairman and CEO until December 31, 2017 when he retired from the Company. Mr. Uggla, former Chairman and CEO of Markit, served as our President and Chief Operating Officer until he assumed the role of Chairman and CEO on January 1, 2018 following Mr. Stead's retirement, a planned succession that was announced at the time of the Merger. 
In April 2018, based on the post-integration positions and responsibilities of the senior leadership team, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, reviewed the Company's executive officers and designated the Chairman and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, President of Resources Transportation & CMS, President of Financial Services, and Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel as executive officers of the Company. Dr. Yergin, Vice Chairman, had been designated an executive officer until April 2018, and therefore, he is included as a named executive officer for purposes of this CD&A as a result of the compensation he earned during 2018. Because Mr. Stead was our Chairman and CEO until December 31, 2017, he is also included as a named executive officer for purposes of this CD&A. 
As of November 30, 2018, the Company's executive officers and named executive officers ("NEOs") were:

Detailed information about our current executive officers can be found under "Corporate Governance and Board of Directors—Executive Officers."  Shareholder Engagement 
Engagement with our shareholders has always been a significant priority for us, and we invest focused time and resources speaking with shareholders and proxy advisors about our corporate governance and executive compensation practices. We have also considered the results of the advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers at our 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders, which shareholders approved by almost 98 percent of the votes cast. 
In response to feedback received from our shareholders, we have made a number of changes to our compensation governance practices and disclosure. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We have had discussions with certain shareholders about annual equity award dilution and we are actively managing our  annual share run rate usage. For 2017, we limited our annual equity award dilution to a maximum annual run rate of 1.25 percent of total common shares outstanding. For 2018, we limited our annual equity award dilution to a maximum annual run  rate of 1.00 percent of total common shares outstanding. For 2019, we are again committed to limiting our annual equity award dilution to a maximum annual run rate of 1.00 percent of total common shares outstanding. Our run rate includes  the outperformance impact of any performance share units.

● We have reviewed the appropriate peer group of companies for an increasingly global and diverse business such as IHS  Markit. As further discussed under 2018 Executive Compensation Design and ActionsCompensation Benchmarking for 2018, in 2018 we updated our peer group of companies to best reflect our unique product mix, size and industries,  to include the companies to which analysts and shareholders compare us, and to reflect companies with which we frequently compete to recruit new talent and retain our existing talent across our business lines.

For more information on changes we made to our governance practices and disclosure in response to our shareholder engagement, please see "Corporate Governance and Board of Directors—Shareholder Engagement."  Compensation Governance Practices 
We have adopted compensation governance policies and practices that are designed to ensure effective oversight of our executive compensation programs while driving our performance and aligning management's interests with that of our shareholders.

Pay-for-Performance     We aim to motivate and reward the achievement of specific annual and long-term objectives, linked to our business strategy.   A majority of total compensation for our executive officers is delivered in performance-based  components through annual and long-term incentives that are linked to financial goals of the Company.   For our Chairman and CEO, 100 percent of his long-term equity-based incentives are in the form of restricted share units with performance-based vesting  ("performance share units" or "PSUs").   For other executive officers,  50 percent of their long-term equity-based incentives are in the form of restricted share units with time-based vesting ("restricted share units" or "RSUs") and 50 percent are in the form of PSUs.   The HR Committee sets appropriate performance targets at the beginning of each fiscal year. At the  end of the fiscal year, the HR Committee determines the extent to which these targets have been satisfied, based on audited results, and approves the level of bonus to be paid.   For long-term equity-based incentives in the form of PSUs, we use stretch financial metrics to  incentivize performance. These metrics are aligned with shareholder interests through the delivery of common shares and long-term time horizons.

 Share Ownership Guidelines     The Board believes that equity ownership in the Company by directors is important. The annual director compensation plan adopted by the Board  provides that part of the annual compensation for services of the Company's nonemployee directors is an annual grant of equity awards. Each director is required to achieve and maintain ownership of common shares with an aggregate value equal to  five times the annual director cash retainer beginning five years from the date of his or her election or appointment to the Board.   Additionally, the HR Committee of the Board has adopted share ownership guidelines for the Chairman and CEO and executive officers.   We believe that it is important that executive officers and directors build up a significant  holding in our common shares to align their interests with those of shareholders. Executive officers and directors are required to hold equity in the Company with an aggregate value equal to a multiple of base salary or annual board retainer, as  applicable.

Incentive Compensation Recoupment (Clawback) Policy     We may require the return, repayment or forfeiture of any annual or long-term incentive compensation payment or award, whether in the form of cash  or equity, made or granted to any current or former executive officer during the three-year period preceding a triggering event as defined in our policy on recovery of incentive compensation. Under these provisions, the HR Committee may apply  clawback or malus adjustment in circumstances which have: (a) resulted in a level of vesting or payment that is higher than would have been otherwise, due to a material misstatement of IHS Markit's financial results or (b) led to a  material financial or reputational loss for IHS Markit due to serious individual misconduct.   We have also updated our equity award agreements in 2019 for all equity participants to better align our practices to those of other companies in similar competitive  industries, including giving us the right to recoup the value of the award if an award recipient violates specified confidentiality, non-compete or non-solicitation  provisions.

[BEGIN TABLE]
● It is fully consistent with our business objectives and strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● It drives accountability and transparency, and aligns executive compensation with shareholders interests.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● It supports our mission, vision and values.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The philosophy is designed to attract, retain and motivate top talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our programs are globally consistent and locally competitive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our short-term incentives are aligned to key business objectives appropriate to colleague role and business segment.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We provide long-term incentives that align colleague and shareholder interests and promote shareholder return.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We have a pay-for-performance  culture that is incentivized to achieve business performance that will sustain growth across the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The program takes into account both affordability and IHS Markits risk appetite, ensuring that our incentive plans  do not encourage any undue risk taking, and strives to avoid any undue complexity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The program strengthens alignment with shareholders, through significant share ownership guidelines that apply to  both executive officers and directors.  
[END TABLE]
 With these guiding principles, we operationalize the executive compensation program as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The program reasonably balances: (a) fixed versus variable pay and (b) short-term versus long-term incentives.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● All incentive plans have specific, financial-based metrics that directly support our near-term and long-term business  objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The annual cash incentive performance metrics for executive officers are Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, with an individual  modifier that provides reasonable levels of upside and downside leverage.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Long-term incentives are delivered in the form of PSUs and RSUs instead of stock options to manage dilution.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● PSUs are earned based on three-year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and three-year cumulative Adjusted EPS growth with a  relative TSR modifier that prevents above-target payouts if TSR performance is below the 50th percentile of the S&P 500 Index. For a definition and discussion of these measures, see Definitions of  Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Both short- and long-term incentives are subject to (a) threshold levels of performance below which no incentives are  paid and (b) performance caps above which no additional incentives are paid.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Benefits are provided as part of a competitive and cost-effective overall remuneration package, including a market-aligned  retirement program.

 Compensation Benchmarking for 2018 
The HR Committee makes individual compensation determinations for executive officers based on a number of factors, including the nature and scope of each executive officer's duties, individual experience and performance, internal pay positioning, and the pay levels for executive officers in similar positions within our peer group of companies. The HR Committee also considers the individual elements of compensation for each executive officer against data from a peer group of companies and S&P 500 Index data. It makes compensation determinations based on total pay opportunities for each executive officer. 
The HR Committee used the peer group of companies shown below to best reflect our unique product mix, size and industries, to include the companies to which analysts and shareholders compare our financial performance, and to reflect companies with which we frequently compete to recruit new talent and retain our existing talent across our business lines. 
During the year, the HR Committee had considerable discussions about the appropriate peer group of companies for an increasingly global and diverse business such as IHS Markit. In December 2017, following detailed analysis and review with Pay Governance, the independent executive compensation consultant retained by the HR Committee, the HR Committee decided to reduce the peer group of companies to be used in benchmarking executive pay from 18 to 14 companies for 2018. The HR Committee reviewed the peer group of companies relative to key competitors, industry and size factors, such as revenue, EBITDA, and market capitalization, and noted certain outliers in the peer group of companies as the Company's market capitalization has grown. The HR Committee approved removing four companies from the peer group of companies whose size and business models were no longer comparable to IHS Markit. Three of the companies, The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, DST Systems, Inc., and FactSet Research Systems Inc., have market capitalizations that are smaller as compared to IHS Markit. The fourth company, Wolters Kluwer N.V., has a business model that is not as relevant to IHS Markit, as it is primarily in the digital and print education business that provides information, software, and services to professionals. 
As a result, the HR Committee reviewed S&P 500 Index data and data from the peer group of 14 intelligence development or financial/analysis processing companies set out below to assess our compensation competitiveness. 
The HR Committee believes this peer group of companies appropriately reflects the companies against which our financial performance is measured and with which the Company competes for business and executive talent, as it includes firms that (i) provide broad industry information and analytics; (ii) provide financial services processing solutions; (iii) provide managed services and software solutions; and (iv) have a median market capitalization of $18.9 billion as of November 30, 2018, positioning IHS Markit at the 55th percentile of the peer group of companies with a market capitalization of $21.0 billion as of November 30, 2018. 
The following companies were identified as our peer group for compensation benchmarking in 2018: 
 Total Pay Mix 
For 2018, variable compensation represented 89 percent of the direct compensation for the CEO, and 79 percent of the direct compensation for the other NEOs, excluding Mr. Stead and Dr. Yergin, who are no longer executive officers. 
2018 Fixed and Variable Pay Elements 
Base Salary 
Following the Merger, changes were made in 2017 to align the base salary of the current Chairman and CEO, Mr. Uggla, to that of his predecessor, Mr. Stead. Both leaders had significant responsibilities during our period of transition and integration. At the time, the HR Committee recommended that Mr. Uggla receive a salary that was market-competitive and, after reviewing his 2016 salary compared to our current peer group of companies, determined that his salary was not competitive for his role given the increased size of the merged company. The HR Committee recommended a new salary aligned with peer group and competitive analysis. The HR Committee also determined that it was appropriate to eliminate Mr. Uggla's perquisites by an amendment to his employment contract effective December 1, 2016. Pursuant to this amendment, his base salary compensation was increased to $1,200,000. The HR Committee also determined that the Company should stop offsetting Mr. Stead's salary with his pension payments and increased his salary to $1,200,000. 
As a result, in their then-current roles as CEO and President, Messrs. Stead and Uggla, respectively had equal compensation opportunities tied to the same overall IHS Markit performance goals, which aligned with the announcement made at the time of the Merger that Mr. Uggla would assume the role of Chairman and CEO upon Mr. Stead's retirement on December 31, 2017. 
During 2018, the HR Committee reviewed Mr. Uggla's base salary against the current peer group of companies and decided to maintain his base salary at $1,200,000. 
With respect to the remaining NEOs, the base salaries of Mr. Kansler, Mr. Gear and Ms. Granat have been increased as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Kanslers role was expanded after the Merger to include business performance responsibilities for the entire  Financial Services segment rather than just the Information sub-segment. During 2018, Mr. Kansler further expanded his responsibilities with the acquisition of Ipreo and a larger Financial Services  business segment to become Executive Vice President, President of Financial Services. In January 2019, following a review of Mr. Kanslers expanded role and of peer group data, the HR Committee approved an increase of his base salary by  9 percent from $550,000 to $600,000, effective as of March 1, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Gears role was expanded during 2018 to Executive Vice President, President of Resources,  Transportation and Consolidated Markets & Solutions. In January 2019, following a review of Mr. Gears expanded role and of peer group data, the HR Committee approved an increase of his base salary by 9 percent from $550,000  to $600,000, effective as of March 1, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ms. Granats role and responsibilities were expanded during 2018 to Executive Vice President, Chief  Administrative Officer and General Counsel. In January 2019, following a review of Ms. Granats expanded role and responsibilities and of peer group data, the HR Committee approved an increase of her base salary from $475,000 to $550,000,  effective as of December 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Cash Incentive Plan 
In 2017, the HR Committee approved a cash incentive plan for executive officers providing target incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary that could pay out above or below target based on financial and individual performance (with payout ranges from 0 percent to 200 percent of target). 
The HR Committee also approved a change in the financial metrics, which determine cash incentive payouts: 
From: Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Revenue (used in 2016) 
To: Adjusted EBITDA and Revenue (used in 2017 and 2018) 
The rationale for the change was that, while both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are profitability indicators, Adjusted EBITDA is an absolute dollar measure, while Adjusted EBITDA Margin measures Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Since IHS Markits Adjusted EBITDA target is developed based on Revenue and assumed Adjusted EBITDA Margin, the HR  Committee decided to use Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 because it requires a certain level of profitability irrespective of Revenue performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The HR Committee believed this to be a better measure of company profitability.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the HR Committee decided to maintain Adjusted EBITDA and Revenue as the financial metrics to determine cash incentive payouts. 
The HR Committee adjusted the initial Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA metrics to account for the impact of acquisitions completed in 2018 and also adjusted the Revenue metric for foreign exchange to measure Revenue on a budgeted currency rate. The adjusted financial metrics and actual 2018 results are set forth in the following table.

[END TABLE]
 Given our strong performance for the year, the HR Committee supported a total payout as a percentage of target of 100 percent for executive officers, including all the NEOs except for Mr. Stead, who did not receive a cash incentive payment. 
Based on achievement of the above-stated goals, the NEOs (other than Mr. Stead) received actual annual cash incentive plan bonus payouts for 2018 as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Long-term equity incentive awards are a key part of our compensation structure in order to align employee and shareholder interests and promote shareholder return. In 2018, all employees were eligible to receive equity awards as part of their total compensation. Participants receive an annual award of conditional share units. Equity incentives are in the form of "performance share units" (PSUs) and "restricted share units" (RSUs). PSUs cliff-vest after three years and pay out based upon performance against cumulative three-year financial goals. RSUs vest ratably over three years. We believe that our current three-year vesting period strikes an appropriate balance between incentivizing long-term strategic thinking and retaining key senior talent. 
The HR Committee determined that the Chairman and CEO, who has significant control and impact on long-term value creation, would be awarded long-term incentive awards in the form of 100 percent PSUs. The HR Committee determined that the other NEOs (other than the Chairman and CEO), who have responsibility for long-term value creation but also shorter-term results and the execution of strategy, would be awarded long-term incentive awards in a ratio of 50 percent PSUs and 50 percent RSUs. 
Table 4 sets out the long-term incentive awards awarded by the HR Committee to the NEOs (other than Mr. Stead) in 2018 as part of their annual performance compensation. The awards were granted on February 1, 2018 with a grant date share price of $47.60.

Special Awards 
The Company granted a special one-time retention equity award to Dr. Yergin in June 2018 with a grant date value of $5,000,000. The equity award is in the form of RSUs that vest ratably over a five-year period on the anniversary of July 1, 2018, provided that Dr. Yergin remains employed through the vesting date in each such year. 
Target Setting Process 
The performance measures we currently use in our cash incentive and long-term incentive plans are all financial. Our performance management process, which we use throughout IHS Markit, assesses executive officers against both financial and non-financial objectives. The executive officers' performance against their individual objectives ultimately supports our financial performance, so we believe it is appropriate that financial measures remain the key incentive plan measures. These seek to ensure that the executive officers deliver the underlying financial performance of the business, whilst clearly aligning with the interests of shareholders. 
For all elements of our incentive programs, we take a number of factors into account when setting targets, including both internal and external expectations. These include brokers' earnings estimates, competitors' earnings estimates, wider economic expectations, the latest internal projections for the current year, the budget, and the strategic plan. Prior to finalizing the targets, the HR Committee undertakes a rigorous exercise at multiple meetings over the course of the year to review and consider the targets to ensure that they are appropriate in the context of expected performance and are a sufficient stretch in our performance based on the factors taken into account. Targets are structured as a sliding scale, with maximum awards only payable for the achievement of significant levels of performance. 
Benefits and Perquisites 
The Company provided its NEOs with life and medical insurance, and other benefits generally available to all colleagues. IHS Markit sponsors a qualified defined contribution plan (401(k) plan for U.S. colleagues) that provides matches to employee contributions. The Company also offered U.S. colleagues an opportunity to participate in a voluntary deferred compensation program through which they could defer a portion of their annual cash compensation. The deferred compensation program was terminated effective November 15, 2017.  The Company believes that perquisites should be kept to a minimum, and of our NEOs, only Mr. Hyatt received perquisites that exceeded the $10,000 disclosure threshold. 
2019 Executive Compensation Program Design 
In 2019, our executive officers will continue to have a strong target-based compensation program that includes: a competitive base salary, an annual cash incentive award target that is tied to pre-established financial goals and a long-term equity incentive award target that is also tied to pre-established financial goals. 
The objectives of both the annual and the long-term incentive awards are to reward, motivate and retain executive officers while driving the long-term performance of the Company. We have a total rewards compensation philosophy, using a mix of cash and equity awards to deliver total compensation at competitive levels. 
The elements of pay for executive officers in 2019 are set forth below:

       A 3-year cumulative measure of each  of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS is included in the PSU measurement in order to incentivize both financial growth and capital allocation management. In addition, the PSUs also include a relative TSR modifier to align the PSU metrics with  overall shareholder return.   We have updated our equity award agreements in 2019 for all equity  participants to better align our practices to those of other companies in similar competitive industries, including giving us the right to recoup the value of the award if an award recipient violates specified confidentiality, non-compete or non-solicitation provisions.

We have updated our equity award agreements in 2019 for all equity  participants to better align our practices to those of other companies in similar competitive industries, including giving us the right to recoup the value of the award if an award recipient violates specified confidentiality, non-compete or non-solicitation provisions.

Compensation Benchmarking for 2019 
In connection with 2019 compensation decisions, the HR Committee reviewed the peer group of companies relative to key competitors across our industry and size factors, such as revenue, EBITDA, and market capitalization. The HR Committee decided to maintain the same peer group of companies as used for 2018. In addition to S&P 500 Index data, the resulting approved peer group of 14 intelligence development or financial/analysis processing companies will be reviewed when assessing compensation competitiveness. 
Total Pay Mix 
For 2019, target variable compensation will represent 91 percent of the direct compensation for the CEO and 80 percent of the direct compensation for the other NEOs, excluding Mr. Stead and Dr. Yergin who are no longer executive officers. 
2019 Fixed and Variable Pay Elements 
Role of Management, HR Committee and Independent Consultant 
Role of Management 
At the HR Committee's request, the Company's management provides the HR Committee with information, analyses, and recommendations regarding the Company's executive compensation program and policies and assists the HR Committee in carrying out its responsibilities. The HR Committee also meets regularly in executive session without management present, including regularly   meeting with its independent compensation consultant. While the HR Committee considers the recommendations of the CEO regarding executive officer compensation levels (other than with respect to his own compensation), the HR Committee ultimately makes all decisions relating to executive officer compensation. 
Role of the HR Committee 
The HR Committee, which is currently composed of five independent directors, is responsible for the compensation of the executive officers. This means that the HR Committee sets base salaries and short-term and long-term incentive targets and approves the individual compensation elements for each executive officer. 
In consultation with Pay Governance, the HR Committee's independent compensation consultant, and Company management, the HR Committee actively oversees the design process of the Company's incentive compensation programs and provides the final approval of incentive programs and quantitative performance metrics. 
The HR Committee establishes target compensation and performance goals for the executive officers and determines annual incentive payments for the prior year, based upon a review of the performance achieved. As the HR Committee makes its decisions, it considers financial results in the most recent year, analysis against the compensation peer group of companies, feedback from shareholders through the Company's engagement activities, feedback from proxy advisors, and input from the independent compensation consultant. The HR Committee reviews and approves compensation with a view to support the Company's long-range plans, achieve superior annual and long-term financial results and make continued progress on the Company's long-term strategic objectives. 
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant 
In 2018, after reviewing Pay Governance's service to the HR Committee in 2017, the HR Committee engaged Pay Governance as its independent executive compensation advisor to provide guidance on executive compensation and related governance matters. In choosing Pay Governance, the HR Committee was specifically searching for a credible leader in the executive compensation field with diversified industry experience and expertise working through mergers of equals and harmonization of compensation plans and philosophies. 
During 2018, Pay Governance advised the HR Committee on the composition of the peer group of companies, provided a competitive review of executive compensation relative to our peer group of companies, provided an assessment of independent director compensation, conducted a risk assessment of our compensation programs, reviewed our share usage and dilution relative to our peer group of companies, and assisted with other executive compensation and governance matters that arose during the course of the year. While the HR Committee considers the recommendations of Pay Governance, the HR Committee ultimately makes all decisions relating to executive officer compensation. 
In July 2018, Pay Governance presented the results of its risk assessment to the HR Committee. It reviewed the attributes and structure of IHS Markit's executive compensation program for the purpose of identifying potential sources of risk within the program design. Its assessment reflected IHS Markit's 2017 and 2018 compensation programs and the Summary Compensation Table values as presented in IHS Markit's 2017 Form 10-K/A and 2018 proxy statement. Based on its review, it did not observe any compensation program attributes that, when considered in the context of IHS Markit's overall   program and oversight framework, indicate that IHS Markit's programs are designed to, or have attributes that suggest they would support, inappropriate risk-taking by executives or employees. 
The HR Committee has direct access to the Pay Governance advisors. Pay Governance had not previously provided services to legacy Markit or legacy IHS. Pay Governance does not perform any other work for IHS Markit, does not trade in IHS Markit common shares, and does not have any other economic interests or other relationships that would conflict with its obligation to provide impartial advice to the HR Committee. 
Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment Arrangements, and Change in Control Arrangements 
Mr. Stead did not have an employment agreement. Both legacy IHS and legacy Markit had entered into employment agreements and severance agreements with certain NEOs that are described under "Executive Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." In 2017, the HR Committee approved the terms of a new form of employment agreement for IHS Markit executive officers. The new form of employment agreement was introduced in mid-2017. During 2018, Mr. Kansler, Dr. Yergin and Ms. Granat signed new employment agreements. 
Compensation and Risk 
As it designed the Company's compensation philosophy and strategy, the HR Committee considered the balance between appropriately motivating executives and employees and ensuring that the Company's compensation program does not encourage excessive risk-taking. The HR Committee, with the assistance of Pay Governance, annually reviews and assesses the risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices. The HR Committee believes that the balance between the Company's cash and equity incentives, selection of performance measures, and other governance practices, such as our share ownership guidelines, anti-hedging/pledging policy, incentive compensation recoupment policy, and sound internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that performance-based compensation is earned on the basis of accurate financial data, all help ensure that the Company's compensation plans and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Accounting and Tax Treatment 
The HR Committee considers the anticipated accounting and tax treatment to IHS Markit and to the executive officers in its decision-making process. From an accounting perspective, the HR Committee's preference is that there are no significant negative accounting implications due to the design of the compensation program. 
Our compensation programs are designed with Sections 409A and 457A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in mind, with the intent to avoid adverse tax consequences for our executive officers. 
Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Throughout this CD&A, we refer to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Adjusted EPS ("earnings per share"). These are non-GAAP financial measures used to supplement our financial statements, which are based on GAAP. We also refer to Revenue, which is a GAAP financial measure.  We define "EBITDA" as net income plus or minus net interest, plus provision for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Our definition of "Adjusted EBITDA" further excludes primarily non-cash items and other items that we do not consider to be useful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs and performance compensation, exceptional litigation, net other gains and losses, pension mark-to-market and other adjustments, the impact of joint ventures and noncontrolling interests, and discontinued operations). "Adjusted EBITDA Margin" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenue. We define "Adjusted EPS" as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted average shares. "Adjusted Net Income" is defined as net income plus or minus primarily non-cash items and other items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing our operating performance (e.g., stock-based compensation expense, amortization related to acquired intangible assets, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs and performance compensation, acquisition financing fees, net other gains and losses, pension mark-to-market expense and other adjustments, and the impact of noncontrolling interests, all net of the related tax effects). 
Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures are provided with the schedules to each of our quarterly earnings releases. The most recent non-GAAP reconciliations and definitions were furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed on January 15, 2019 in the schedules to our most recent quarterly earnings release for the year ended November 30, 2018 and on pages 36 and 45 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 18, 2019. They are also available on our website (http://investor.ihsmarkit.com). 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of our HR Committee were at any time during 2018, or at any other time, an officer or employee of IHS Markit or any of our subsidiaries or had any relationship requiring disclosure under the SEC's rules regarding related person transactions. None of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has an executive officer that serves on our Board of Directors or our HR Committee.

(1)  Table 1 describes compensation for 2018, 2017 and 2016. As a foreign private issuer for 2016, we were not required to  disclose past years' compensation for Mr. Uggla, Mr. Kansler and Ms. Granat, who were employed by Markit prior to the Merger (the "legacy Markit NEOs"). Messrs. Stead and Hyatt (the "legacy IHS NEOs") became executive  officers post-Merger and we were required to report their post-Merger compensation (between July 12, 2016 and November 30, 2016). Mr. Gear became an NEO in 2017. Ms. Granat became an NEO in 2016 and again in 2018. Dr. Yergin  became an NEO for the first time in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  For 2018 and 2017, this table discloses a full fiscal year of compensation for all NEOs. Per SEC disclosure requirements,  for 2016, this table discloses a full fiscal year of compensation for the legacy Markit NEOs and post-Merger compensation (between July 12, 2016 and November 30, 2016) for legacy IHS NEOs. See Footnotes 10 and 15 to this table for  additional information on 2016 amounts paid to Messrs. Hyatt and Stead, the legacy IHS NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amounts represent payments under the legacy Markit annual performance compensation program to legacy Markit NEOs.  Discretionary payments were made in 2017 based on the individual's and Markit's performance in 2016.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The value of 2018 and 2017 awards and Mr. Stead's 2016 awards were calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic  718. The value reported for PSUs reflects the grant date fair value of PSUs assuming target performance level. For 2016, for the legacy Markit NEOs, the value reported reflects the grant date fair value of restricted share awards calculated in  accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based Payment ("IFRS 2"). Any estimated forfeitures are excluded from the values reported in this table. For a discussion of the assumptions made in valuing these awards  and a description of how we factor forfeitures into our overall equity compensation expense, refer to "Note 12—Stock-based Compensation" to our audited financial statements contained in the Annual Report. The values exclude any  additional stock-based compensation recognized as a result of a re-valuation of outstanding awards held by these legacy Markit NEOs at the time of the Merger, as required by the GAAP accounting rules governing  the Merger.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  The value reported reflects the grant date fair value of stock options calculated in accordance with IFRS 2. Any estimated  forfeitures are excluded from the values reported in this table. For a discussion of the assumptions made in valuing these awards and a description of how we factor forfeitures into our overall equity compensation expense, refer to "Note  12—Stock-based Compensation" to our audited financial statements contained in the Annual Report. The values exclude any amounts recognized as a result of a re-valuation of outstanding stock options  held by legacy Markit NEOs at the time of the Merger, as required by the GAAP accounting rules governing the Merger.

(6)  For 2018, the amounts represent payments made under our annual cash incentive plan, which were made in 2019 based on  achievement of pre-determined 2018 goals. For 2017, the amounts represent payments made under our annual cash incentive plan, which were made in 2018 based on achievement of  pre-determined 2017 goals. For 2016, the amounts represent the post-Merger pro-rata payments made under the legacy IHS annual incentive plan (the "AIP") to the  legacy IHS NEOs, which were made in 2017 based on achievement of pre-determined 2016 goals. The full fiscal year portion of the 2016 incentive payment, which was tied to Customer Delight ($345,600 for  Mr. Stead and $135,405 for Mr. Hyatt), was paid in IHS Markit common shares. The Customer Delight metric for legacy IHS, the only non-financial metric included in the AIP, was measured with an  ongoing, dedicated assessment of customers' preferences and product needs through surveys and follow-up contacts. Each year, a target goal for Customer Delight was established and performance was then  evaluated throughout the year based on the results of external customer surveys.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  For 2018 and 2017, the amounts represent the aggregate increase in actuarial value to the NEO of pension benefits accrued  during 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on the November 30th measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes. Generally, actuarial values decreased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to a change in the discount rate. Dr. Yergin  received an actuarial increase as required by the plan now that he is over age 70.5. Assumptions used to calculate the change in pension value are discussed in "Note 11—Pensions and Postretirement Benefits" to our audited financial  statements contained in the Annual Report. For 2016, the amounts represent the aggregate increase in actuarial value, pro-rated for the post-Merger period of July 12, 2016 to November 30, 2016, to  the NEO of legacy IHS pension benefits accrued during the fiscal year. The amounts are based on the November 30th measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes. Assumptions used to calculate the change in pension value are  discussed in "Note 11—Pensions and Postretirement Benefits" to our audited financial statements contained in the Annual Report.

The actual number of PSUs that would vest, if any, will be based on the level of achievement of the applicable  performance goal as of the actual end of the applicable performance period.

 Pension Benefits 
IHS Markit sponsors a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "U.S. RIP") for all legacy IHS U.S. employees employed prior to January 1, 2012. The U.S. RIP was frozen in July 2014 and all future benefit accruals have ceased. IHS Markit also sponsors a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan (the "SIP") to provide benefits to participants that are limited by Internal Revenue Code limits that apply to tax-qualified defined benefit plans. The SIP was also frozen in July 2014 as it was directly linked to the U.S. RIP. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the maximum permissible benefit from the qualified plan for retirement in 2018 is $220,000 and annual compensation exceeding $275,000 in 2018 cannot be considered in computing the maximum permissible benefit under the plan. Benefits under the SIP replace the benefits that would have been provided if the Internal Revenue Code limits were not in place. We have taken initial steps to terminate the U.S. RIP and are awaiting approval from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation before proceeding. For 2018, we have used the same accounting estimate methodology as in prior years. 
Table 5, below, sets forth the present value of accumulated benefits payable at age 65 (or later date if applicable) as of November 30, 2018 for the four legacy IHS NEOs who participated in these plans.

(1)  In 2003, Mr. Stead was granted an additional 25 years of benefit service under the Supplemental Retirement Income  Plan, which is $2,238,165 of the present value listed above. Although Mr. Stead retired on December 31, 2017, he received pension payments during the entire 2018 fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
Accrued Benefits 
The accrued benefits are calculated according to the formulas outlined below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Formula A:  Benefits accrued as of April 30, 2006 equals (1)+(2)+(3) (expressed in the form of a single life annuity):   
[END TABLE]
 Plus 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Formula B:  From May 1, 2006 to March 30, 2011, 15 percent of pensionable earnings, payable at age 65 as a lump sum  pension.  
[END TABLE]
Plus 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Formula C:  From April 1, 2011 to July 11, 2014, 10 percent of pensionable earnings, payable at age 65 as a lump sum  pension.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, compensation means regular salary, bonuses, commissions and overtime prior to January 1, 1987, and regular salary, commissions and overtime for January 1, 1987 and later. Compensation after January 1, 2009 excludes commissions for the SIP. 
Note that A, B and C may be payable as an annuity or a lump sum. For grandfathered participants, service through March 31, 2011 is covered under Formula A. Mr. Stead is the only NEO who is a grandfathered participant. 
Vesting 
Participants are 100 percent vested in their benefit at the earlier of the time they are credited with three years of vesting service or the date they reach age 65. Messrs. Hyatt, Gear, Stead and Dr. Yergin are 100 percent vested. 
Retirement Eligibility 
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65, but a participant who terminates employment with at least ten years of vesting service may retire as early as age 55. Under Formula A above, participants who terminate employment after age 55 with ten years of vesting service will receive a benefit reduction equal to 0.5 percent for each month that benefit commencement precedes age 62. Participants who terminate employment before age 55 with ten years of vesting service will receive a benefit reduction equal to 0.5 percent for each month that benefit commencement precedes age 65. Formula A will be actuarially reduced for benefit commencements prior to age 55. 
Under Formulas B and C, participants who terminate prior to age 65 will receive a benefit reduction equal to 4.5 percent compounded annually for each year commencement precedes age 65. 
Participants who continue employment after attaining age 70-1/2 will have actuarial adjustments applied to the benefit amount to reflect the delay of commencement beyond age 70-1/2. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
Legacy IHS established a Deferred Compensation Plan for employees who are at or above a vice president level in 2015. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees may defer between 10 percent and 50 percent of their salary, wages, commissions, and bonuses, including payment under the Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP"). Amounts paid under the U.S. RIP or the SIP are not eligible for deferral. The deferred amounts may be invested in the same funds available under the Company's 401(k) plan. Compensation may be deferred from one to 10 years from a specified date or after separation from service. The Company does not make any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan. On November 14, 2017, an amendment was adopted by the Company   to terminate the Deferred Compensation Plan effective November 15, 2017. No further elections to defer compensation are permitted and the accumulated value of deferred compensation was distributed on February 15, 2019. 
Under the terms of the legacy IHS Directors Stock Plan, legacy IHS directors were able to convert all or a portion of their annual cash retainers to deferred stock units that will be distributed in IHS Markit common shares after the director's service terminated. For 2015, Mr. Stead elected to defer to deferred stock units his director fee for service as chairman of the legacy IHS board. Mr. Stead did not make any compensation deferrals in 2016, 2017 or 2018.

 EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
The Company has entered into an employment agreement with each of the Company's NEOs, except for Mr. Stead, which sets forth the terms of employment and details the compensation elements and benefits, if any, due to the NEOs upon a termination of employment. 
Below are descriptions of the employment agreements with the Company's NEOs. These descriptions summarize the agreements' material terms, but do not describe all of their provisions. The NEO employment agreements are filed as exhibits to the Company's public filings with the SEC. 
Lance Uggla 
Effective as of July 1, 2014, legacy Markit entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Uggla, which was further amended on March 19, 2016 and on January 24, 2017, and that included the following provisions: 
Term. Mr. Uggla's agreement does not entitle Mr. Uggla to employment for any specified period of time and his employment will continue to be considered employment-at-will. The Company may terminate Mr. Uggla's employment by giving four weeks' notice and an additional week of notice for each additional year of service up to 12 weeks' notice or may provide payment in lieu of notice. 
Base salary, bonus and benefits. The agreement provides for an initial base salary of £450,000 to be reviewed annually. Mr. Uggla's current base salary is $1,200,000. Mr. Uggla's salary is currently set in U.S. dollars, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Mr. Uggla will be eligible to participate in the annual cash incentive plan and may receive an incentive payment if he remains employed on the date the incentive is paid. The HR Committee in its sole discretion determines the amount of the incentive awards. Mr. Uggla is also entitled to participate in the employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements as are customarily accorded to our executives as well as the Pensions Salary Sacrifice option, which allows Mr. Uggla to authorize the Company to pay a portion of his salary as an additional employer contribution to the Markit Group Personal Pension Plan. 
During 2018, Mr. Uggla's target bonus was increased from 150 percent of base salary to 160 percent of base salary and Mr. Uggla's annual target stock award grant was increased from $6,000,000 to $8,000,000 with an effective date of December 1, 2017. The increase was approved by the HR Committee in January 2018 to (i) reflect his new role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and (ii) enhance the competitiveness of his total pay opportunity. 
Covenants. Under Mr. Uggla's agreement, he has agreed not to disparage the Company or any of our subsidiaries and to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary or confidential information at all times during his employment and thereafter, and he has assigned to us all of the intellectual property rights in any work product created or developed by him during the term of his employment. He has also agreed not to compete with the Company during the term of his employment and the 12-month period following termination of his employment and not to solicit any of the Company's customers, employees, or prospective customers of any of our subsidiaries during that restricted period. 
Termination provisions. Under the terms of Mr. Uggla's agreement, upon an involuntary termination without cause or a termination for defined good reason, Mr. Uggla will receive a cash severance payment equal to one month of his base salary and target bonus for every year of service, up to a maximum of 12 months (the "Service Severance"). If, however, Mr. Uggla's employment is terminated   without cause or if he resigns his employment for defined good reason within 12 months following a change in control, Mr. Uggla will receive a cash severance payment equal to his base salary and target bonus over 12 months (the "Change in Control Severance"), in addition to the Service Severance. For Mr. Uggla, good reason may be triggered in the event of: (a) a material reduction in his base salary or other material failure to provide the compensation due under his employment agreement, (b) a material diminution of his authority, duties, responsibilities or title; or (c) the Company's material breach of his employment agreement. 
Amendments. In connection with the Merger and to assure Mr. Uggla that he would have been protected if he had not received the CEO position at the designated time, as previously agreed, we amended Mr. Uggla's employment agreement on March 19, 2016 to provide that, if he was not serving as the Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit by January 1, 2018 (the "Succession Trigger," as defined in the amended agreement), he could resign for good reason. In such event, or in the event his employment had been terminated without cause after the 12-month anniversary of the closing of the Merger and on or prior to January 1, 2018, he would have been entitled to receive (i) Service Severance, (ii) Change in Control Severance, (iii) full vesting of all unvested equity awards granted under the IHS Markit 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan and (iv) continued vesting of outstanding unvested equity awards granted under the Markit Key Employee Incentive Program until the first anniversary of the termination date, when such awards would have vested in full. A Succession Trigger did not occur and, in accordance with the terms of the Merger agreement, Mr. Uggla assumed the CEO role upon Mr. Stead's retirement on December 31, 2017. 
Mr. Uggla's employment agreement was further amended on January 24, 2017 to remove any entitlement to perquisites, effective as of December 1, 2016. 
The termination benefits described above are subject to Mr. Uggla executing a release in favor of IHS Markit. 
Todd Hyatt 
Effective as of November 1, 2013, legacy IHS entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Hyatt, which included the following provisions: 
Term. Mr. Hyatt's agreement does not entitle Mr. Hyatt to employment for any specified period of time and his employment will continue to be considered employment-at-will. 
Base salary, bonus and benefits. The agreement provides for an initial base salary of $430,000 to be reviewed and increased at the discretion of our management. Mr. Hyatt's 2018 base salary is $601,800. Mr. Hyatt will be eligible to participate in the annual cash incentive plan with a target bonus of 75 percent of his base salary, which bonus payout will be based on actual business results and subject to Mr. Hyatt's continued employment through the payment date. Mr. Hyatt is also entitled to participate in the employee benefits plans, programs, and arrangements as are customarily accorded to our executives. 
Equity Incentives. In accordance with his agreement, Mr. Hyatt is eligible to participate in the IHS Long-Term Incentive Program. Following the Merger, Mr. Hyatt is eligible to participate in the IHS Markit 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan. 
Covenants. Under Mr. Hyatt's confidentiality and invention agreement, dated as of May 28, 2002, he has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary or confidential information at all times   during his employment and thereafter, unless first obtaining our prior written consent. He has also assigned to us all of the intellectual property rights in any work product created or developed by him during the term of his employment. 
New Expatriate Agreement. On July 8, 2016, legacy IHS entered into an expatriate agreement for Mr. Hyatt in anticipation of his assignment from the United States to the United Kingdom to serve as the CFO of the Company. The expatriate agreement was not a contract of employment but rather a summary of the terms of his assignment. The two-year expatriate agreement provided Mr. Hyatt with benefits that are often provided to executive officers who are serving on an international assignment, including allowances for housing, cost of living and transportation; home leave; international health-care coverage; relocation, shipment and storage services; and tax equalization and tax preparation. 
Amendments. On July 8, 2016, legacy IHS entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Hyatt in connection with the Merger to extend severance payable on certain terminations until January 31, 2019. The 2016 agreement and the original 2013 letter agreement were amended by a new letter agreement on February 3, 2017 (collectively, the "Amendments"). 
Termination Provisions 
Termination prior to or on January 31, 2019. Under the terms of the Amendments, upon an involuntary termination without cause, a termination for defined good reason or a termination due to death or disability, in each case, that occurred prior to or on January 31, 2019, Mr. Hyatt would have been entitled to (i) full vesting of all of his unvested equity awards granted before July 12, 2016, (ii) continuation of health and welfare benefits for 24 months following such termination of employment and (iii) outplacement services for 24 months following such termination of employment. Upon an involuntary termination without cause or a termination for defined good reason that occurred within 15 months following a change in control that occurred prior to or on January 31, 2019, Mr. Hyatt would have been eligible to receive (i) continuation of health and welfare benefits for 24 months following such termination of his employment, (ii) full vesting of all his unvested equity awards and (iii) outplacement services for 24 months following such termination of his employment. For Mr. Hyatt, good reason may be triggered in the event of: (a) a reduction in his base salary or target bonus percentage opportunity; (b) a material diminution of authority and responsibility; or (c) the Company's relocation of his principal work location by more than 50 miles without Mr. Hyatt's consent.

Effective as of June 1, 2014, legacy IHS entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Gear, which was amended prior to the Merger by a letter agreement entered into on July 8, 2016 (collectively, the "July 2016 Agreement"). The July 2016 Agreement included general employment terms and provided for payments upon certain terminations of employment, including enhanced severance upon a termination of employment that occurred prior to January 31, 2019. The July 2016 Agreement also provided that Mr. Gear was eligible for a transition cash award of $550,000, which would have been payable on December 31, 2018, subject to his remaining employed with the Company as of that date. However, effective as of April 2, 2017, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Gear, which superseded the July 2016 Agreement and waived the transition cash award, but reiterated some of the terms of the previous agreements. 
Term. Mr. Gear's new agreement does not entitle Mr. Gear to employment for any specified period of time and his employment will continue to be considered employment-at-will.

Mr. Gear's base salary may be reviewed and remains subject to adjustment in subsequent years. Mr. Gear's salary is currently set in U.S. dollars, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Mr. Gear will be eligible to participate in the annual cash incentive plan and may receive an incentive payment if he remains employed on the date the incentive is paid. For 2017, his target cash incentive opportunity is 75 percent of his base salary and final payment will be based on achievement of individual performance objectives and the Company's performance, as determined by the HR Committee. Mr. Gear is also entitled to participate in the employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements as are customarily accorded to our executives. The agreement also provides that Mr. Gear will be eligible to receive discretionary long-term incentive awards as approved by the HR Committee in accordance with the IHS Markit 2014 Equity Incentive Award Plan. 
Special Award. In connection with Mr. Gear's new agreement, in 2017, the HR Committee approved four special long-term incentive award grants to Mr. Gear to ensure his continued efforts through   December 2021. He received three PSU grants with a total grant date value of $3.208 million. Each PSU grant cliff-vests based on actual performance against 3-year financial goals (2017-2019, 2018-2020, and 2019-2021) and the value is annualized over the full 5-year vesting cycle of the awards. Mr. Gear also received an RSU grant with a total grant date value of $3.208 million that is annualized over a 4-year, 8-month vesting schedule with the final tranche vesting on December 31, 2021.

Other than Mr. Stead, each NEO has entered into agreements that provide for key employment terms and compensation in the event of certain forms of termination of employment or a change in control of the Company. These agreements are described under "Executive Employment Agreements." 
All of the NEOs, except for Mr. Stead on account of his retirement on December 31, 2017, benefit from accelerated vesting of all or a portion of their equity awards following certain termination events, pursuant to the terms of their individual agreements or awards. In addition to the amounts discussed in the tables below, all of the NEOs may receive payouts from our qualified plans in the same manner that any salaried employee would (for instance, life or disability insurance payouts, pension plan payouts, or similar benefits). Mr. Hyatt, Mr. Gear and Dr. Yergin also would receive the benefits described in further detail in "Executive Compensation Tables—Pension Benefits" and Messrs. Hyatt and Kansler would receive the benefits described in further detail under "Executive Compensation Tables—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
The following table provides details of the nature and amounts of compensation to each NEO, assuming a hypothetical termination (or a change in control of the Company and subsequent termination) on November 30, 2018, the last day of our most recent fiscal year. The table is based on the following four scenarios: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Voluntary Termination Other Than for Good Reason or Involuntary Termination for Cause  
[END TABLE]
This category refers to voluntary terminations by the executive other than for defined good reason (including resignations, retirements, or other terminations by mutual agreement) as well as terminations by the Company for cause (including willful failure to perform material duties). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Termination for Good Reason without Change in Control   
[END TABLE]
This category refers to voluntary terminations by the executive for defined good reason or involuntary terminations by the Company without cause, without a preceding change in control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Termination for Good Reason with a Change in Control   
[END TABLE]
Each of the NEOs who were employed as of the last day of the fiscal year had protection in the event of termination following a change in control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Death or Disability  
[END TABLE]
Other than Mr. Stead, each of the NEOs have protection pursuant to their employment agreements in the event of a termination of employment due to death or disability.  Table 1. Potential Post-Termination Payments Table

 CEO Pay Ratio 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (the "Pay Ratio Rule"), we are providing the following reasonably estimated information for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (except our CEO) was $87,721;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the annual total compensation of our CEO was $11,190,210(1); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the ratio of these two amounts was 128 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The annual total compensation of our CEO calculated for purposes of the Pay Ratio Rule consists of the 2018 total  compensation reported in "Table 1. 2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "Executive Compensation Tables" plus the value of Company contributions to broad-based employee benefit plans not already included in the summary  compensation table.  
[END TABLE]
Due to the change in CEO that occurred January 1, 2018, the information provided is with respect to our CEO serving as of September 30, 2018, the date used to identify the median employee, as if he had been serving in such position all year. 
The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the Pay Ratio Rule based on our internal records and the methodology described below. 
To identify the median annual total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO), we first identified our total employee population from which we determined our "median employee." We determined that, as of September 30, 2018, our global workforce of full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees consisted of approximately 13,278 individuals of which approximately 41 percent were located in the United States and 59 percent were located in jurisdictions outside the United States. Since Ipreo was acquired on August 2, 2018, approximately 1,180 employees were excluded for 2018. 
To identify our "median employee" from our total employee population, we compared the amount of base salary, commissions and annual cash incentives paid and annual equity incentives granted from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of our full-time and permanent part-time employees who were hired during the year but did not work for us for the entire year. We identified our "median employee" using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation. Using the methodology described above, we determined that our "median employee" was a full-time, salaried employee located in the United States. 
Once we identified our "median employee", we then calculated such employee's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 (as set forth in "Table 1. 2018 Summary Compensation Table" under "Executive Compensation Tables"). As permitted by the Pay Ratio Rule, we added the value of employer contributions to broad-based employee benefit plans not already included in the summary compensation table. 
The Pay Ratio Rule for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allows companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as result, our reported pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions 
We have adopted a written related person transaction policy designed to minimize potential conflicts of interest arising from any dealings we may have with certain related parties and to provide appropriate procedures for the disclosure, approval and resolution of any real or potential conflicts of interest which may exist from time to time. Such transactions generally include any non-ordinary-course transaction and the persons involved include any IHS Markit directors, nominees for director, executive officers, a person or entity that is known to be a beneficial owner of more than five percent of our voting securities, or any immediate family members or affiliates of any of them. It could include direct or indirect material interests in the transaction or the persons involved. 
The Board has delegated to the Nominating and Governance Committee the responsibility for reviewing transactions in which related persons have a direct or indirect material interest. Our policy and procedures provide, among other things, that all such related person transactions require approval or ratification by our Nominating and Governance Committee, after considering all relevant information, including, without limitation, whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms-length dealing with an unrelated third party, the business reasons and the commercial reasonableness of the terms of the transaction and opportunity costs of alternative transactions, the benefit and perceived benefit, or lack thereof, to us and the related person, the materiality and character of the related party's direct or indirect interest, and the actual or apparent conflict of interest of the related party, and after determining that the transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests. On an annual basis, the Nominating and Governance Committee will review previously approved ongoing related person transactions, under the standards described above, to determine whether such transactions should continue. 
To support this process, each year we solicit internal disclosure of any transactions between IHS Markit and its directors and executive officers, their immediate family members, and their affiliated entities, including the nature of each transaction and the amount involved. In addition, all directors, officers, and employees of IHS Markit are governed by our Business Code of Conduct and our Conflict of Interest Policy, which require directors, officers and employees to inform the General Counsel or Chief Compliance Officer of any existing or proposed relationship, financial interest, or business transaction that could be, or might appear to constitute, a conflict of interest or a related person transaction. The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews and evaluates all relevant information received for each director as part of its assessment of each director's independence. 
Use of Aircraft 
From time to time, the Company leases, on a non-exclusive basis, an aircraft operated by Jet Exchange Limited ("Jet Exchange") for business-related purposes. The aircraft is owned by LJUG Partners LP, in which Lance Uggla, our Chairman and CEO, has a partial interest. The Company leases the aircraft on a per use basis from Jet Exchange and is not required to lease any minimum number of hours on the aircraft. Based on quotes for similar services provided by unrelated third parties, the Company believes that the lease rates paid to Jet Exchange were no less favorable to the Company than those that could be obtained from unrelated third parties. For fiscal year 2018, the Company paid an aggregate of $285,575 to Jet Exchange for use of the aircraft.  Registration Rights Agreement 
On June 24, 2014, we entered into a registration rights and lock-up agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with our executive officers at the time, including Mr. Uggla and Mr. Kansler, and certain shareholders. On June 10, 2015, the Registration Rights Agreement was amended in connection with a secondary offering of shares at that time (the "2015 Secondary Offering"), in which the shareholders were permitted to sell up to 85 percent of their Initial Ownership Common Shares (as defined below). The agreement, as amended, provides for the restrictions and rights set forth below. For purposes of this section only, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, RBS, UBS, and Credit Suisse are referred to as the "Bank Shareholders," and General Atlantic, Temasek and CPPIB are referred to as the "PE Shareholders." The Bank Shareholders, PE Shareholders, and the other persons party to the agreement are collectively referred to in this section as the "Shareholders." 
Transfer restrictions. Until June 24, 2018, the fourth anniversary of Markit's initial public offering, without the prior written consent of the Company, the Bank Shareholders and PE shareholders were subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of any common shares they beneficially owned as of the closing of Markit's initial public offering (the "Initial Ownership Common Shares"). In addition, our CEO, Lance Uggla, had separately agreed with us to transfer restrictions on 3,000,000 common shares either held by him or to which he is a beneficiary, on terms substantially similar to the transfer restrictions that were applicable to the PE Shareholders. All transfer restrictions set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement have expired and the Shareholders are able to freely transfer their common shares, subject to any applicable securities laws and regulations. 
Demand registration rights. Subject to the transfer restrictions described above, any two Shareholders that are either Bank Shareholders or PE Shareholders, or both are entitled to request that we effect up to an aggregate of four demand registrations under the Registration Rights Agreement, but no more than one demand registration within (i) a period of 90 days after the effective date of any other demand registration statement or (ii) any successive 12-month period beginning on the first anniversary of the closing of Markit's initial public offering or any anniversary thereof. Within 10 business days of our receiving a demand notice, we must give notice of such requested demand registration to the other Shareholders. Within five business days after the date of our notice, any of such other Shareholders may request that we also effect the registration of certain of their common shares that are eligible for registration. Any demand registration through the fourth anniversary of the closing of Markit's initial public offering was required to meet an expected aggregate gross proceeds threshold of $100 million. 
The demand registration rights are subject to certain customary conditions and limitations, including customary underwriter cutback rights and our ability to defer registration. If any Shareholders are cut back by the underwriters, they may either seek a waiver from us permitting them to sell any excluded common shares by any means available under the Securities Act or request that we effect a second demand registration, which would not be deemed one of the four available demand registrations. If, in connection with a second demand registration, any Shareholders are cut back by the underwriters, then such Shareholders may sell any excluded common shares by any means available under the Securities Act. 
In addition, if any PE Shareholder still owns 100 percent of the number of its Initial Ownership Common Shares and our Board includes a PE Shareholder director nominee, such PE Shareholder will be entitled to one additional demand registration (which each other PE Shareholder may join so long as it satisfies the same requirements as the requesting PE Shareholder). Such additional demand   registration shall not be deemed one of the four available demand registrations. In addition, if, as of the fourth anniversary of the closing of Markit's initial public offering, any Shareholder owns more than five percent of our issued and outstanding common shares, then such Shareholder will be entitled to one additional demand registration (which any other Shareholder may join so long as it satisfies the same requirements as the requesting Shareholder). Such additional demand registration shall not be deemed one of the four available demand registrations. 
Shelf registration rights. If we are eligible to use a shelf registration statement, then any two Shareholders that are either Bank Shareholders or PE Shareholders, or both, will be entitled to request that we effect a shelf registration on similar terms as the demand registrations described above, except that offerings will be conducted as underwritten takedowns. Each underwritten takedown constitutes a demand registration for purposes of the four demand registrations we are obligated to effectuate subject to the additional demand rights described in the immediately preceding paragraph. 
The Registration Rights Agreement provides that we must pay all registration expenses (other than fees and expenses of the Shareholders, including counsel fees and any underwriting discounts and commissions) in connection with any effected demand registration or shelf registration. The Registration Rights Agreement contains customary indemnification and contribution provisions. 
Indemnification Agreements 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements and our bye-laws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
If a shareholder wishes to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, the proposal must be received by the Company Secretary of IHS Markit no later than the close of business on October 30, 2019. Such proposals must be sent to: Company Secretary, c/o Legal Department, IHS Markit Ltd., 4th Floor, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY, United Kingdom or by email to CompanySecretary@ihsmarkit.com. 
If a shareholder wishes to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders under our bye-laws, or to nominate a person for election as a director, the shareholder, and the proposal must comply with the requirements set forth in our bye-laws, including by the shareholder giving timely notice of the proposal in writing to the Company Secretary of IHS Markit at the principal executive offices of IHS Markit. In order to be timely under our bye-laws, notice of shareholder proposals must be received by the Company Secretary of IHS Markit, not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual general meeting of shareholders. If the next annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or after that anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be received not later than 10 days following the earlier of the date on which notice of the annual general meeting was posted to shareholders or the date on which public disclosure of the date of the annual general meeting was made. Therefore, assuming that our 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is called for a date that is not more than 30 days before or after April 11, 2020, we must receive notice of such a proposal or nomination for the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders no earlier than December 13, 2019 and no later than January 12, 2020. We suggest that shareholders submit proposals by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
If the "proxy access" bye-law amendments are approved by shareholders at the Annual Meeting, a shareholder (or a group of up to 20 shareholders) who has owned at least 3 percent of our issued and outstanding common shares continuously for at least three years and has complied with the other requirements in our bye-laws may nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20 percent of the Board. Assuming that our 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is called for a date that is not more than 30 days before or after April 11, 2020, we must receive notice of such proxy access nomination for consideration at the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders no earlier than November 13, 2019 and no later than December 13, 2019. 
Additionally, under Bermuda law, shareholders holding not less than five percent of the total voting rights or 100 or more shareholders together may require us to give notice to our shareholders of a proposal to be submitted at an annual general meeting. Generally, notice of such a proposal must be received by us at our registered office in Bermuda, located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda, not less than six weeks before the date of the meeting and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Bermuda law.  We recommend that any shareholder desiring to make a nomination or submit a proposal for consideration obtain a copy of our bye-laws. They are available on our website at http://investor.ihsmarkit.com or free of charge upon written request sent to Company Secretary, c/o Legal Department, IHS Markit Ltd., 4th Floor, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London, EC2Y 9LY, United Kingdom or by email to CompanySecretary@ihsmarkit.com. 
The IHS Markit 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K has been mailed with this Proxy Statement.

The following shall be treated as one Eligible Member if such Eligible Member shall provide together with the Member Notice documentation satisfactory to the Board  that the Eligible Member consists only of two or more funds that are: (A) under common management and investment control; (B) under common management and funded primarily by the same employer; or  (C) a "group of investment companies" (each as defined in the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended).

An Eligible Member "owns" Common Shares held in the name of a nominee  or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Member retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted and possesses the full economic interest in the Common Shares. An Eligible Member's ownership  of Common Shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Member has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time  by the Eligible Member.
