Message from our Lead Independent Director
Dear Stockholders,
As an innovative company working to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need, we are committed to delivering products that change the lives of millions of patients around the world. We believe in our approach to innovation: relentlessly pursuing the best breakthroughs in science—whether they are found within our own labs or through our partnerships.
Advancing Our Business Looking back, 2018 was a year of strong and consistent operational and financial execution, despite significant leadership transitions. A few areas to highlight:
Welcoming Daniel O'Day as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer After a comprehensive search process led by the Board, March 1, 2019 marked Dan's first day as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Dan's record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, his deep understanding of the evolving, global healthcare environment and his unwavering commitment to driving innovation will serve Gilead and our stockholders well as we continue the work to deliver on our ambitious goals.
Engaging with Stockholders Our Board of Directors continued its accountability to you through active engagement and oversight of our company's leadership, strategy, business objectives and potential risks. Consistent with prior years, in 2018, along with the executive team, I had the pleasure of meeting with some of our largest stockholders to gain critical insights about a number of governance topics. We highly value stockholder feedback, and I was pleased to share the feedback with Gilead's executive leadership and our Board of Directors.
Aligning Pay and Performance Our compensation programs create appropriate incentives for our executive officers. These incentives focus on long-term success and align our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders. In 2018, our annual incentive plan paid out above target as a result of the strong progress in our product pipeline and execution against rigorous business goals. At the same time, the realized value of our executives' outstanding equity awards earned over the last several years is well below the grant date value, reflecting our stock price volatility, resulting from the unique dynamics of the curative hepatitis C virus therapies. In our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we discuss the direct alignment of pay with stockholder returns and the impact of leadership transitions on how we paid our executives in 2018.
Your Continued Confidence and Support On behalf of our entire Board of Directors and more than 11,000 employees, we thank you for your investment in Gilead. We ask for your voting support on the matters described in this Proxy Statement so we can continue our important work to improve the lives of patients impacted by the diseases our products treat or cure.
We encourage you to read more about our 2018 performance in the Year in Review, which will be available for download at www.gilead.com beginning May 2, 2019.
Sincerely,
John F. Cogan, Ph.D. Lead Independent Director
We believe in our approach to innovation: relentlessly pursuing the best breakthroughs in science—whether they are found within our own labs or through our partnerships.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Proxy Statement contains "forward-looking statements" — that is, statements related to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual future results to differ are set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of, and elsewhere in, our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof, and Gilead undertakes no obligation to update any such statements.
2018 Performance Highlights
2018 Was Marked by Exceptional Operational and Financial Performance Despite Significant Leadership Transitions
Senior Leadership Transitions
Following 28 years of service, John F. Milligan, Ph.D. stepped down from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer at the end of 2018. John C. Martin, Ph.D. also stepped down from his role as Chairman of our Board of Directors (our "Board") after more than 28 years of service at Gilead, having determined that this would be a natural transition point from his successive roles as Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman and Chairman. Following a comprehensive search, in December 2018, we announced the selection of Daniel P. O'Day to serve as our new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 1, 2019. Mr. O'Day brings more than 30 years of experience in executive management, creative leadership and operational excellence, having held diverse leadership roles across North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Most recently, Mr. O'Day served as the Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the pharma division of Roche Group. Our Board views Mr. O'Day as a transformational leader with a track record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, a deep understanding of the evolving healthcare environment around the world, and an unwavering commitment to driving innovation across all aspects of a business. Our Board believes these attributes are critical to advancing our goals and driving stockholder value in the future.
We also had other executive officer transitions in 2018, including the promotion of John McHutchison, A.O, M.D. to Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development, and the hiring of Laura J. Hamill as Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations. Some of these transitions resulted from planned retirements and successions while others reflected normal industry turnover.
With the fresh perspective of new leaders and the deep experience of continuing leaders, we are well-positioned for growth in multiple therapeutic areas in an increasingly complex healthcare environment.
Ongoing Operational Excellence
2018 was a year filled with significant accomplishments and success in meeting our operational goals:
Table of Contents
Overview
During 2018, we repaid $6.3 billion of debt and returned almost $6 billion to stockholders, including cash dividends of $3 billion and share repurchases of $2.9 billion. In addition, in 2018 and again in early 2019, we announced double-digit percentage increases to our dividend, which underscores our confidence in the strength of the business and future cash flows.
Successful Product Launches
We launched Biktarvy® in the United States and the European Union. Through its first 11 months, Biktarvy is the best HIV launch of all time in the United States, as measured by total prescriptions on a launch-aligned basis. In addition, we received approval for Yescarta in the European Union in 2018 and have begun treating patients in the United Kingdom and Germany.
Strategic Collaborations and Investments
We continued to utilize our strong balance sheet to significantly enhance our research pipeline by executing 25 partnerships, licensing, M&A or equity investment deals in 2018 as summarized below:
Pipeline Performance
We advanced our nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ("NASH") and inflammation programs by enrolling Phase 3 studies significantly ahead of schedule. Although our first Phase 3 NASH trial did not meet its primary endpoint, we continue to evaluate the efficacy of selonsertib. For our investigational compound, filgotinib, we announced positive data from ongoing Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. We expect to announce additional filgotinib data in 2019. In addition, we continued to invest in research for next-generation HIV therapies, including long-acting injectables for the prevention or treatment of HIV.
Financial Performance and TSR
Since 2000, our HIV and non-HCV businesses have grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 30% as measured by total product sales. However, the unique dynamics created by the curative nature of our HCV products have impacted our five-year total shareholder return ("TSR") and masked the significant and consistent growth we experienced in our core HIV business since inception.
In 2013, we launched our first HCV cure product, which was a significant improvement over the then standard of care for HCV treatment. As a result, a significant number of "warehoused" patients whose treatment had been delayed sought therapy, contributing to our substantial HCV product sales in 2014 and 2015. Our HCV product sales peaked in 2015, resulting in nearly a tripling of our total product sales that year compared to 2013.
Table of Contents
Overview
Once the initial group of patients was treated and as competitive HCV therapies entered the market, our HCV product sales rapidly declined. Our HCV product sales continued to decline in 2018, causing our total product sales to decrease 16% compared to 2017.
The following chart illustrates the effect of our HCV products on our total product sales and stock price and the performance of our core HIV and other non-HCV products since inception:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)  Based on the closing price on the last business day of the applicable year 
[END TABLE]
The effect of our HCV products on our total product sales and stock price over the last several years has affected our TSR as shown above and in the graph below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)  Data per S&P Research Insight as of December 31, 2018 
[END TABLE]
Despite the expected decline in our HCV product sales, we achieved total product sales of $21.7 billion, which was above the high end of the guidance we revised in October 2018. Our HIV product sales increased by 12% in 2018 compared to 2017, despite the loss of exclusivity for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ("TDF"), a backbone component of our earlier HIV treatment products in certain markets. This growth is being driven by our Descovy® (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide)-based products, such as Biktarvy, as well as Truvada® for pre-exposure prophylaxis, an indication for HIV prevention. The development of our Descovy-based portfolio of HIV treatments exemplifies our ability to innovate to consistently deliver stockholder value. Looking ahead, we expect double-digit year-on-year growth in our HIV business in 2019 and believe that, for the first time in several years, this growth will offset the continued expected decline in our HCV product sales, providing an opportunity to grow total product sales from 2018.

Overview
Corporate Governance Highlights
We are committed to strong corporate governance structures and practices that reflect our commitment to integrity and excellence in conducting our business and that are designed to make our Board effective in exercising its oversight role. The governing framework within which our Board fulfills its responsibilities, together with the associated governance documents, is available at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance." Our Board regularly reviews these materials in light of legal and regulatory requirements, evolving best practices and other developments.
Our Board values the feedback we receive from our stockholders regarding corporate governance and other matters, and we have a history of being responsive to stockholders. Our Board has adopted corporate governance structures and practices that create accountability to our stockholders, as summarized in the table below.
Additional information regarding certain of the above governance practices is set forth below.
Stockholder Right to Act by Written Consent
Our Board is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to allow stockholders to take action by written consent. In connection with our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we received a stockholder proposal requesting that the Board take the necessary steps to allow stockholders to act by written consent. Our Board recommended against this stockholder proposal, in part due to concerns that it could disenfranchise smaller stockholders. Of the votes cast, 50.9% supported the proposal (representing approximately 37.1% of our outstanding stock). In the fall of 2018, we solicited feedback from our stockholders related to the 2018 stockholder proposal and how we could amend our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to authorize action by written consent in a way that protects and is in the best interests of all stockholders. Based on the feedback we received and on a comprehensive review of market practice with respect to written consent rights, our Board has proposed this amendment, which includes a threshold to request a record date for action by written consent at 20% of our outstanding shares (matching the threshold required to call a special meeting), as well as procedural and other safeguards that are consistent with market practice to safeguard fairness and transparency in the process for all our stockholders.

Overview
Ongoing Board Refreshment
We believe Board refreshment is integral to effective corporate governance. We continue to review our Board's composition and seek to balance continuity and fresh perspectives. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending director candidates to our Board for nomination. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to include diverse candidates in every director search.
We have taken a number of steps to refresh our Board since 2015, when some stockholders noted that many of our directors were long tenured. Of our current nine directors, four were appointed to our Board in the last three years:
Stockholder Outreach and Engagement
We believe that strong corporate governance includes outreach and engagement with our stockholders on a regular basis throughout the year to better understand the issues that are important to them. This enables us to address these matters in a more meaningful and effective way and to drive improvements in our policies, communications and other areas. As part of our robust stockholder engagement program, our senior management team addresses a variety of topics through regular contact with investors, including in quarterly earnings calls, investor and industry conferences, analyst meetings and discussions with individual stockholders.
In the fall of 2018, we contacted stockholders representing approximately 38% of our outstanding shares, and we met with stockholders representing approximately 29% of our outstanding shares and the two largest proxy advisor firms, gaining valuable insights. During these meetings, we discussed a range of topics, including company strategy and performance, corporate governance, executive compensation, corporate social responsibility and other current and emerging topics. A key topic at the time was the Chief Executive Officer transition. John F. Cogan, Ph.D., our Lead Independent Director, participated in these discussions and answered questions about the transition. Another corporate governance topic raised by our institutional investors was the Corporate Governance Principles for U.S. Listed Companies issued by the Investor Stewardship Group ("ISG"). We believe our strong corporate governance structures align with these ISG principles. We gained constructive feedback from our stockholders during these engagements, which was shared with our Board and management.

The Gilead Board of Directors
In identifying potential director nominees, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers Board candidates recommended through a variety of methods and sources. These include suggestions from current Board members, senior management, stockholders, professional search firms and other sources. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews all candidates in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation.

Corporate Governance
Evaluating Director Candidates
In evaluating candidates for membership on the Board, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the candidate's relevant experience, the number and nature of other board memberships held and possible conflicts of interest. Diversity is an important attribute of a well-functioning board. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee advises our Board on matters of diversity, including race, gender, culture, thought and geography, and nominates director candidates that will cause the Board to reflect a range of viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experience and expertise. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to include diverse candidates in any director search and specifically requests diverse candidates from our third party search firm. In addition to the traditional candidate pool of corporate directors and officers, the committee also considers qualified candidates from a broad array of organizations, including academic institutions, privately held businesses, nonprofit organizations and trade associations. In 2017, our Board amended the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter to formalize our Board's commitment to diversity. Each year, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews its Board membership criteria and assesses the composition of the Board against the criteria.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also will consider all factors it determines appropriate to meeting the needs of the Board at that particular time. According to the Board membership criteria established by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, candidates nominated for election or reelection to the Board should possess the following qualifications:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  the highest standards of personal and professional integrity;   
■  the ability and judgment to serve the long-term interest of our stockholders;   
■  experience and expertise relevant to our business and that will contribute to the overall effectiveness and diversity of the Board;   
■  broad business and social perspective;   
■  the ability to communicate openly with other directors and to meaningfully and civilly participate in the Board's decision-making process;   
■  commitment to serve on the Board for an extended period of time to ensure continuity and to develop knowledge about our business and willingness to devote appropriate time and effort to fulfilling the duties and responsibilities of a Board member;   
■  independence from any particular constituency; and   
■  the ability and willingness to objectively appraise the performance of management. 
[END TABLE]
It is the policy of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider properly submitted stockholder recommendations of new director candidates. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's evaluation process for director nominees does not vary based on whether a candidate is recommended by a stockholder or the Board. Any stockholder recommendation must include the candidate's name and qualifications for Board membership, the candidate's age, business address, residence address, principal occupation or employment, the number of shares beneficially owned by the candidate and all other information that would be required to solicit a proxy under federal securities law. In addition, the recommendation must include the stockholder's name, address and the number of shares beneficially owned. The recommendation should be sent to the Corporate Secretary, Gilead Sciences, Inc., 333 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, California 94404. The recommendation must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary prior to the same deadline for director nominations not for inclusion in the proxy materials, as described under question 15 in "Questions and Answers."

Director Emeritus
In 2006, our Board appointed Dr. George P. Shultz, one of our former directors, to serve as Director Emeritus. As an advisor to our Board, Dr. Shultz may attend Board meetings, including meetings of the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the committees on which he served prior to his retirement, in a non-voting capacity.
Independence of the Board of Directors
The Nasdaq listing rules require that a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors qualify as "independent" as affirmatively determined by our Board. In addition, our Board Guidelines require that a substantial majority of our Board consist of "independent" directors as defined by the Board Guidelines. Our Board Guidelines are available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
After a review of all relevant transactions and relationships between each director, as well as his or her family members, and us, our senior management and independent registered public accounting firm, our Board has determined that eight of our nine nominees for director are "independent" directors as specified by applicable laws and regulations of the SEC, the listing rules of Nasdaq and our Board Guidelines. Mr. O'Day, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is not an independent director.
Majority Vote Standard for Election of Directors
Our bylaws require directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director in uncontested elections (number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director). In a contested election (a situation in which the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the standard for election of directors will be a plurality of the shares voting in the election of directors at any such meeting at which a quorum is present. Under our Board Guidelines, any director who fails to receive at least a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation to our Board. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then evaluate the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to our Board to accept or reject the resignation or to take other action. Our Board will act on our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale for such decision within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in our Board's decision. If a nominee who was not already serving as a director does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast for such director at the annual meeting, that nominee will not become a director.

Corporate Governance
Our Board has adopted certain corporate governance principles, which we refer to as our Board Guidelines, to promote the functioning of the Board and its committees and the interests of stockholders and to set forth a common set of expectations as to how the Board, its various committees and individual directors should perform their functions. Our Board Guidelines are available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
The Board's Role and Responsibilities
Oversight of Risk
The Board exercises its oversight responsibility directly and through its committees. The Board considers specific risk topics directly, including, but not limited to, risks associated with our company's strategic plan and risks relating to pricing strategies of newly approved products. The Board has delegated oversight of certain risks to relevant committees:
Each of the committees periodically reports to the Board on its risk oversight activities. In addition to receiving reports from our Board committees, our Board periodically reviews Gilead's management of specific material risks or legal developments. We believe our Board's leadership structure effectively supports the Board's independent evaluation and management of risk.
Code of Ethics
Our written Code of Ethics applies to all of our directors and employees, including our executive officers. The Code of Ethics is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance." Changes to or waivers of the Code of Ethics will be disclosed on the same website. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding any amendment to, or waiver of, any provision of the Code of Ethics by disclosing such information on the same website.

Stockholder Communications with our Board
Stockholders may communicate with our Board by sending a letter to the Corporate Secretary, Gilead Sciences, Inc., 333 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, California 94404. Our Corporate Secretary reviews all communications from stockholders, but may, in his sole discretion, disregard any communication that he believes is not:
If deemed an appropriate communication, the Corporate Secretary will submit the stockholder communication to the member of the Board addressed in the communication and to our Lead Independent Director. We maintain a "Stockholders Communications with the Board" policy that outlines the applicable procedures and is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
Board Structure
Board Leadership
Mr. O'Day was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, effective March 1, 2019.
Our Board believes that it is in the best interests of Gilead and its stockholders for Mr. O'Day to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board because it positions Mr. O'Day to effectively drive future strategy and decision-making for our organization. In addition to public, private and non-profit board experience, Mr. O'Day has a track record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, deep understanding of the evolving healthcare environment around the world and unwavering commitment to driving innovation across all aspects of the business. As the individual with primary responsibility and accountability for managing our day-to-day operations, Mr. O'Day can provide unified leadership of Gilead and ensure that key business and strategic issues, risks and opportunities are brought to our Board's attention in a way that prioritizes and makes best use of the Board's time.
Our Board Guidelines provide that the independent directors will designate a Lead Independent Director when the Chairperson is not an independent director. Dr. Cogan has served as the Lead Independent Director since May 2013.
We believe our current Board leadership structure provides effective oversight of management and strong leadership of the independent directors. The defined role of Lead Independent Director at Gilead is closely aligned with the role of an independent Chairperson. As set forth in the Lead Independent Director Charter, the Lead Independent Director has clearly delineated and comprehensive duties.
Lead Independent Director duties include:

In addition, as required by our Board Guidelines, Gilead's independent directors meet without executive management on a routine basis to review, among other things, Gilead's strategy, performance, management effectiveness and succession planning. In addition to his role as Lead Independent Director, Dr. Cogan is a member of the Audit Committee and the Scientific Committee and frequently attends meetings of other Board committees. In addition, Dr. Cogan leads the Board in conducting an annual assessment of the Board and committees of the Board to evaluate their effectiveness.
The Lead Independent Director Charter is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
Meetings of our Board of Directors and Board Committees; Attendance at Annual Meetings
Our Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Scientific Committee. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of our Board and of the committees on which they served during the year ended December 31, 2018 (or the period for which they served).

Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions
Indemnity Agreements
We have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our executive officers (including our Named Executive Officers) and directors that provide, among other things, that we will indemnify such officer or director, under the circumstances and to the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines and settlements he or she may be required to pay in actions or proceedings to which he or she is or may be made a party by reason of his or her position as a director, officer or other agent of us, and otherwise to the full extent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws.
Policies and Procedures
Our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving, in advance, all related person transactions. Related persons include any of our directors or executive officers, certain of our stockholders and their immediate family members, and transactions include any transaction or arrangement in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and where the company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. In reviewing and approving any such transactions, our Audit Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated third party and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. The responsibility for reviewing and approving such transactions is set forth in writing in the Audit Committee Charter. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
To identify related person transactions, each year we submit and require our directors and officers to complete Director and Officer Questionnaires identifying any transactions with us in which the executive officer or director or their immediate family members have a material interest.
We review related person transactions due to the potential for a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with our interests. In addition, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines, on an annual basis, which members of our Board meet the definition of independent director under the criteria specified by applicable laws and regulations of the SEC, the listing rules of Nasdaq and our Board Guidelines. The obligation for this determination is set forth in writing in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. A copy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance." Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and discusses any relationships with directors that would potentially interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Finally, our Code of Ethics establishes the corporate standards of behavior for all our employees, officers and directors and sets our expectations of contractors and agents. The Code of Ethics is available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page. Our Code of Ethics requires any person who becomes aware of any departure from the standards in our Code of Ethics to report his or her knowledge promptly to a supervisor or an attorney in the legal department.

Compensation of Non-Employee Board Members
General
The members of our Board play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and overseeing our management. In recent years, the evolving role and responsibilities of the Board have increased the time commitment required for, and risks associated with, board service. As a result, the demand for highly qualified and experienced individuals who are capable of serving as the directors of a large public company has also increased.
These dynamics make it imperative that we provide a competitive compensation program for our non-employee directors. Such directors are accordingly compensated based upon their respective levels of Board participation and responsibilities, including service on Board committees, and receive a combination of annual cash retainers and equity compensation in the form of stock options and restricted stock unit awards. In addition, our non-employee directors are also reimbursed for their business-related expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board and committee meetings and related activities. Our employee directors do not receive additional compensation for their service on the Board.
Our Compensation Committee reviews our non-employee director compensation program on an annual basis with its independent advisor. Any recommended changes to the program are then presented to the independent members of the Board for their consideration and approval.
Non-Employee Board Member Compensation
Our non-employee directors are compensated through annual equity awards under a pre-established grant-date fair value formula and annual cash retainers for Board and Board committee service.
Cash Payments and Equity Awards
The following table sets forth the compensation arrangements for our non-employee Board members during 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   A non-employee director's actual annual cash retainer will be equal to the aggregate of his or her retainer fee for Board service ($75,000) plus his or her retainers for service on one or more Board  committees (e.g., if the Audit Committee Chair also serves as a member on the Compensation Committee, the total dollar amount of the cash retainer will be $135,000). 
(2)   The number of shares of our common stock subject to the option portion of the annual equity award will be calculated as follows: $150,000 divided by [(closing market price per share of our common stock on the  grant date) multiplied by (Black-Scholes option-valuation percentage)], with any fractional share rounded down to the next whole share. The number of shares of our common stock subject to the restricted stock unit portion of the annual equity award will  be calculated by dividing $150,000 by the closing market price per share of our common stock on the award date, with any fractional share rounded down to the next whole share. 
(3)   The Lead Independent Director will receive an additional retainer of $75,000 should the Lead Independent Director not serve on any committees of the Board or $40,000 should the director serve on a committee (in  addition to any retainer amounts for Committee service). 
(4)   The Lead Independent Director, Committee Chairs and other Committee members do not receive any additional equity awards for their Lead Independent Director or Committee service.

Corporate Governance
For his service as Chairman of the Board commencing in March 2018, Dr. Martin received an annual retainer of $300,000, which he elected to receive in cash.
Deferred Compensation Plan
Our Deferred Compensation Plan allows our non-employee directors to defer all or a portion of their cash retainer each year. The deferred amount may either be immediately converted into phantom shares of our common stock or invested in a designated group of investment funds, where none results in above-market interest under disclosure rules. To the extent that a non-employee director elects to defer his or her cash retainer into phantom shares, the resulting number of phantom shares of our common stock will be determined by dividing the deferred amount by the fair market value per share of our common stock on the conversion date. The resulting number of phantom shares will be paid out in actual shares of our common stock at the end of the deferral period. If the non-employee director elects to defer his or her retainer into investment funds, then he or she may select from among the 27 investment funds available under the Deferred Compensation Plan. These investment funds are substantially the same as those available under our broad-based Section 401(k) employee savings plan.
A non-employee director may elect to receive his or her deferred account balance at a designated age that is no earlier than age 50 and no later than age 75, or on the date of his or her cessation of Board service or on the second or fifth anniversary of that cessation date, in a lump sum or in annual installments not to exceed 10 years. An early distribution is permitted in the event of a financial hardship. In the event of death, an account balance will be distributed in a lump sum to the director's designated beneficiary.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board of Directors maintains stock ownership guidelines to encourage our non-employee directors to retain a significant portion of their shares of our common stock. These stock ownership guidelines require our non-employee directors to hold shares of our common stock with an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than five times their annual retainer. This guideline is to be achieved over a five-year period, measured from the date the non-employee director first joins the Board. As of December 31, 2018, all members of the Board are in compliance with their stock ownership guidelines.
Terms of Equity Awards
The stock options granted to our non-employee directors have an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant (based on the closing market price for our common stock on that date as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market). Each option has a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination three years after the non-employee director's cessation of Board service (with service as Director Emeritus to be treated for such purpose as continued Board service). Each option vests in successive equal quarterly increments over a one-year period, measured from the date of grant. The restricted stock unit awards granted to our non-employee directors vest upon the completion of one year of Board service measured from the date of grant. Initial equity awards for new non-employee directors are prorated based on the number of days remaining in the compensation period in which they commence Board service. The shares that vest under restricted stock unit awards may, pursuant to a director's advance election, be subject to a deferred issuance in up to five annual installments following his or her cessation of Board service.

The aggregate grant-date fair value of the 2018 revenue subtranches were $892,509. See footnotes 6 and 7 to the 2018 Grants of  Plan-Based Awards table on page 64 for a detailed description of the terms of the 2016 and 2017 performance shares. The applicable grant-date fair value of each award was determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting  Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718") and accordingly calculated by multiplying the number of shares of our common stock subject to the award by the closing price per share of our common stock on the award date, without any  adjustment for estimated forfeitures related to such service vesting. No other stock awards were made to the non-employee Board members during the 2018 fiscal year. 
(3)   Represents the grant-date fair value of the stock option award of 9,496 shares with an exercise price of $65.69 per share made to each Board member on May 9, 2018 except for Dr. Barton and Dr. Martin.

Assumptions used in the calculation of grant-date fair value are set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated  Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year. No other option awards were made to the non-employee Board members during the 2018 fiscal year.

The phantom shares will be paid out in actual shares of our common stock at the end of the deferral period.

Annual Evaluation and Selection of Independent Auditor
To help ensure continuing auditor independence, our Audit Committee annually reviews Ernst & Young LLP's independence and performance in connection with the Committee's determination of whether to retain Ernst & Young LLP or engage another firm as our independent auditor. In the course of these reviews, our Audit Committee considers, among other things:
Based on this evaluation, our Audit Committee has determined that Ernst & Young LLP is independent and that it is in the best interest of Gilead and its stockholders to continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent auditors for 2019.
Rotation of Lead Audit Partner
The Audit Committee requires the lead audit partner to be rotated at least every five years. The process for selection of Gilead's lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation involves a meeting between the Chair of our Audit Committee and the candidate for the role as well as discussion by the full Audit Committee and management.

Principal Accountant Fees and Services
Our Audit Committee is responsible for audit firm compensation. The aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 for the professional services described below are as follows:
All of the services described above were pre-approved by our Audit Committee. The Committee concluded that the provision of these services by Ernst & Young LLP would not affect their independence.
Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures
To minimize relationships that could impair the objectivity of Ernst & Young LLP, our Audit Committee adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP. Under this policy, our Audit Committee must pre-approve all services provided by Ernst & Young LLP, and the policy prohibits the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP for certain specified services. The policy permits the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP for services approved by our Audit Committee in defined categories such as audit services, audit-related services and tax services. The policy also permits engagement of Ernst & Young LLP for other services approved by our Audit Committee if there is a persuasive business reason for using Ernst & Young LLP over other providers. The policy provides that, as a general rule of thumb, the fees for these other services should be less than 25% of total audit fees. Pre-approval may be given as part of our Audit Committee's approval of the scope of Ernst & Young LLP's engagement or on an explicit case-by-case basis before Ernst & Young LLP is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated by our Audit Committee to a member of the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on the scope of services provided to date and planned to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP in the future.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at our Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
Stockholder ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, our Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of Gilead and our stockholders.

Audit Committee Report
Our Audit Committee is composed of three directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Our Board has determined that all members of our Audit Committee are "independent" directors under the criteria specified by applicable laws and regulations of the SEC, the listing rules of Nasdaq and our Board Guidelines, including the heightened independence standards under Exchange Act Rule 10A-3.
Our Audit Committee oversees, on behalf of our Board, our corporate accounting, financial reporting process and systems of internal accounting and financial controls. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the selection, appointment, retention, compensation, oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. Our Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the auditors' independence from Gilead and its management. As part of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding Ernst & Young LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and our Audit Committee discussed Ernst & Young LLP independence from Gilead.
We also considered whether Ernst & Young LLP's provision of non-audit services to Gilead is compatible with the auditor's independence. Our Audit Committee concluded that Ernst & Young LLP is independent from Gilead and its management.
We adopted auditor independence policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP. The policy permits the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP for services approved by our Audit Committee in defined categories such as audit services, audit-related services and tax services. The policy also permits engagement of Ernst & Young LLP for other services approved by our Audit Committee if there is a persuasive business reason for using Ernst & Young LLP over other providers. Our Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on the scope of services provided to date and planned to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP in the future.
Our Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and Ernst & Young LLP. Our Audit committee has reviewed and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, issued by the PCAOB.
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Gilead's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. Our Board has approved this inclusion.

   Amendment to Gilead's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Allow Stockholders to Act by Written Consent Our Board is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate") to delete the current prohibition in the Certificate on stockholder action by written consent and add a new Section 3 to Article VI (the "Amendment"). 
   Amendment to Gilead's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Allow Stockholders to Act by Written Consent Our Board is submitting for stockholder approval an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation ("Certificate") to delete the current prohibition in the Certificate on stockholder action by written consent and add a new Section 3 to Article VI (the "Amendment"). 
[END TABLE]
Background
In connection with our 2018 annual meeting, we received a stockholder proposal requesting that the Board take the necessary steps to allow stockholders to act by written consent. Of the votes cast, approximately 50.9% supported the proposal (representing approximately 37.1% of our outstanding shares). In 2018, the Board recommended voting against this stockholder proposal, as we already provide stockholders with the right to act between annual meetings through the power to call a special meeting. In addition, our Board had concerns regarding the potential abuse of a right to act by written consent, since such a right could lead to significant actions being approved without giving all stockholders adequate notice and the opportunity to express their views at an open stockholder meeting. Our Board remains concerned about the disruptive effect a consent solicitation could have on the Board's and stockholders' ability to thoroughly consider significant corporate actions and possible alternatives.
Stockholder Engagement and Feedback
We seek out and highly value the perspectives of our stockholders and have a strong record of responsiveness to stockholder concerns. Consistent with our commitment to soliciting and considering feedback from stockholders, in fall 2018, as part of our ongoing engagement efforts, we solicited specific feedback from our stockholders related to the 2018 written consent proposal and how we could amend our Certificate to authorize stockholders to act by written consent in a way that protects and is in the best interest of all stockholders. We contacted stockholders representing 38% of our shares outstanding. Of those that we contacted, 19 stockholders, representing 29% of our outstanding shares met with us in person or by phone. We also met with the two largest proxy advisory firms.
Many of our large institutional stockholders with whom we engaged expressed the view that the right to act by written consent was unnecessary in light of our existing stockholder rights, including the right to call special meetings, for which some expressed a preference. Nevertheless, they encouraged us to be responsive to the majority-supported stockholder proposal by adopting a written consent right. Nearly all the stockholders expressed concerns that the written consent process could be subject to abuse absent adequate procedural safeguards, or were otherwise supportive of reasonable safeguards to prevent abuse while also making the right usable under the appropriate circumstances.
Among various procedural safeguards, the most commonly discussed safeguard during our stockholder engagement was the minimum percentage of our shares that a stockholder (or a group of stockholders) must own in order to initiate the written consent process. Stockholders were universally supportive of implementing such a threshold. Holders of approximately 90% of the shares reached through our engagement efforts supported a 20% threshold to match our existing 20% threshold for calling a special meeting. These stockholders expressed concerns about the possibility for abuse if the percentage was set too low, potentially covering agenda items relevant to particular constituencies as opposed to stockholders generally, with attendant significant cost, management distraction and diversion of management and financial resources. After careful consideration of the feedback we heard from our stockholders, our Board determined to set the threshold to request a record date for action by written consent at 20% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock to be responsive to feedback we heard from our stockholders and to match the current 20% threshold that is required for stockholders to call a special meeting.

After a comprehensive review of market practice and procedural safeguards adopted by other companies with respect to written consent rights, our Board has proposed including additional procedural safeguards to ensure fairness and transparency in the process for all our stockholders. During our fall engagement, nearly all the stockholders supported the Board using its discretion to implement these procedural and other safeguards, consistent with market practice. The proposed safeguards include the following:
This summary of the proposed amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Amendment attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
If this Proposal 3 is approved by stockholders, we will file with the Delaware Secretary of State the Amendment set forth in Appendix A, which will become effective on the date the Amendment is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date stated in the filing. If Proposal 3 is not approved by the requisite vote, the Amendment will not be implemented and our current prohibition on stockholder action by written consent will remain.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
2018 was a year marked by transition and ongoing operational excellence for Gilead. Following 28 years of service, John F. Milligan, Ph.D., stepped down from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 31, 2018. On December 8, 2018, our Board of Directors (our "Board") announced the selection of Daniel P. O'Day to be our new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective March 1, 2019. We had other leadership transitions throughout the year resulting from planned successions and normal industry turnover. With the fresh perspective of new leaders and the deep experience of continuing leaders, we are well-positioned for growth in multiple therapeutic areas in an increasingly complex healthcare environment. We maintained strong performance on many fronts, including achieving record revenue in our HIV franchise, even as we faced generic competition in certain markets. Through internal research efforts and our investments in innovative early stage companies, with 25 partnerships, licensing, M&A or equity investment deals compared to six in 2017, we ended 2018 with more product candidates in our development pipeline than ever before. The transitions described above have had an effect on how we paid our executives as well as how pay is reported in the Summary Compensation Table:

-  The share-based incremental expense is not reflective of the actual realizable value of the accelerated awards. In fact, all of Dr. Milligan's accelerated options were underwater as of year-end, and the value of his performance shares is contingent on future performance achievement.

Executive Compensation
Granted and Realized Pay Delivery Alignment with Stockholder Value
Our industry's business model is characterized by significant capital investment, long lead times for discovery and development and unpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medications for human use.
Our business involves multi-year development cycles, in which the return on investments in our product pipeline may take 12 years or more. Thus, our compensation programs establish goals and metrics to measure performance over the short and long term. Our executive compensation programs focus not only on the successful progression of research programs, clinical trials and the launch of new products, but also on performance across a range of shorter-term goals and milestones that advance our long-term strategy and longer-term value creation for our stockholders. As a result of long development cycles, success in the early phases of development, while critical to achieving our long-term strategy and short-term goals, may not always be reflected in the current operating performance and our share price.
Our long-term incentives, awarded in the form of performance shares and stock options, align executives' compensation directly with TSR performance. As a result, a substantial portion of the target total direct compensation ("TDC") for each Named Executive Officer is tied directly to Gilead's performance with an appropriate balance between short- and long-term corporate goals, as shown below.
In aggregate, target TDC for our Named Executive Officers approximated the median compared to our peers. However, target pay opportunity is not representative of actual realized pay unless we perform. For example:
To illustrate the alignment with stockholder value, the following table compares the three-year target long-term equity incentive award values to the actual payout for our former Chief Executive Officer and shows that only 24% of the target value was delivered.

Key Achievements in 2018
Senior Leadership Transitions
Chief Executive Officer Succession
In July 2018, we announced that Dr. Milligan, our President and Chief Executive Offer, would be stepping down after a 28 year career with Gilead, effective December 31, 2018. Following Dr. Milligan's departure as President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Alton was named to serve as interim Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2019 through February 28, 2019.
Mr. O'Day was then appointed to serve as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer commencing on March 1, 2019. He brings more than 30 years of experience in executive management, creative leadership and operational excellence, having held diverse leadership roles across North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Most recently, Mr. O'Day served as the Chief Executive Officer of Roche Pharmaceuticals, the pharma division of Roche Group. Our Board views Mr. O'Day as a transformational leader with a track record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, a deep understanding of the evolving healthcare environment around the world, and an unwavering commitment to driving innovation across all aspects of a business. Our Board believes these attributes are critical to advancing our goals and driving stockholder value in the future.
Promotion of Dr. McHutchison to Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development
In March 2018, we announced the promotion of Dr. McHutchison to Chief Scientific Officer and Head of Research and Development following the retirement of Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. McHutchison joined Gilead in 2010 as Senior Vice President, Liver Diseases Therapeutics and was named Executive Vice President, Clinical Research in 2014. Under his leadership, we have developed five medications for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus and chronic hepatitis C virus. In addition, Dr. McHutchison has been instrumental in building our oncology and inflammation therapeutic areas.

See "Pay Actions Related to Leadership Transition" on page 50 for additional details related to our senior leadership transitions.
Stockholder Engagement and 2018 Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation
During 2018, we contacted stockholders representing approximately 38% of our outstanding shares to gain valuable insights.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ►  During these meetings, we discussed key corporate governance topics and asked our stockholders whether they had any concerns or feedback about our current executive compensation program. Dr. Cogan, our Lead Independent Director, also met with stockholders to answer questions about our Chief Executive Officer transition. Of the stockholders we met, none expressed significant concerns about the design or structure of our compensation programs. 
[END TABLE]
At the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we held a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Approximately 89% of the votes cast were voted in favor. Our Compensation Committee carefully reviews feedback from our stockholder engagement activities and these voting results when making decisions regarding our executive compensation program. Our Compensation Committee did not change the structure of our executive compensation program based on the outcome of the 2018 stockholder advisory vote and feedback received from our investors, and we continued to establish rigorous financial, research and development, and strategic goals for earning performance-based incentives.
Stockholders may express their views directly to our Compensation Committee as described in our "Stockholder Communications with the Board" policy, available on our website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "Corporate Governance."
Named Executive Officers' 2018 Compensation
Base Salaries
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves our Chief Executive Officer's base salary, subject to ratification by the independent members of our Board. For 2018, our Compensation Committee approved, and our Board ratified, a 3% increase for Dr. Milligan's base salary. Dr. Milligan presented his recommendations for base salary increases for our other Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Hamill who commenced employment in August 2018) to our Compensation Committee. The recommendations for our other Named Executive Officers were based on individual achievements during 2017 and expectations for their roles moving forward, as well as competitive market positioning. Named Executive Officers' 2018 base salary increases were effective as of March 1.

Annual Bonuses
Our annual bonus plan is designed to reward the achievement of key short-term corporate objectives to recognize our commercial performance and research and development as well as strategic goals that serve as building blocks for our future product development and operational goals, as well as individual performance objectives that drive our longer-term corporate performance and growth.
The annual bonus of our Chief Executive Officer was tied solely to our achievement of corporate financial and operational performance objectives based on our 2018 annual operating plan. The annual bonuses for our other Named Executive Officers were weighted 75% on achievement of the same corporate financial and operational performance objectives that applied to our Chief Executive Officer and 25% on each Named Executive Officer's achievement of individual performance objectives, with award amounts determined by the following formula:
Target Bonus Opportunities
The 2018 target bonus opportunities for our Named Executive Officers were established as a percentage of their base salaries. Actual earned amounts could range from 0% to 150% of the target opportunity, based on achievement of the relevant performance objectives as follows:

[END TABLE]
Corporate Performance Objectives and Achievements for 2018
Following the end of the year, our Compensation Committee considered our performance against the forgoing pre-established objectives, the degree of difficulty in achieving the objectives and relevant events and circumstances that affected our performance. Based on these assessments, our Compensation Committee assigned a corporate performance factor between 0% and 150% for each category, as shown below. The chart below illustrates our performance targets for each component of the award as well as achievements considered against each goal.
Our Compensation Committee can add or subtract an additional 10% to recognize unanticipated factors, provided that the total amount payable does not exceed the maximum bonus opportunity for the year. If our Compensation Committee determines that the overall corporate performance factor for the year was less than 50%, no bonus is payable. In addition, our Compensation Committee has the authority to exercise negative discretion to reduce payments.

[END TABLE]
Based on of the achievements described above, our Compensation Committee certified an overall corporate performance achievement of 140% of target, reflecting the fact that we significantly exceeded our goals in most areas. Given the long-term nature of our industry, we continued to focus on strategic initiatives that we believe will deliver value to stockholders over many years. Our Board believes that our achievements in 2018 positioned us for future long-term growth. For example, we are confident in the strong fundamentals in the HIV business and the potential growth of cell therapy, both of which are long-term growth areas for us. In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $3 billion. We have strong operating margins, which are greater than 50% (on a non-GAAP basis)(1), resulting in strong cash flows. Our strong cash flow has given us the financial strength to continue to build our pipeline, not only internally but through mergers and acquisitions and external partnerships. We have a strong foundation for future products and growth in multiple therapeutic areas through the 25 partnerships, collaborations and investments in 2018.

Individual Performance Objectives
Our Compensation Committee also considered the individual contributions of our Named Executive Officers (other than our Chief Executive Officer, whose annual bonus opportunity was based entirely on corporate performance) to the achievement of the research and development, commercial, financial and operational objectives that supported our corporate objectives. The assigned individual performance factors reflect the extent to which each Named Executive Officer's personal contributions were determined to benefit our overall performance and to exceed or fall short of his or her individual objectives. In considering the annual bonus attributable to individual performance, our Chief Executive Officer and Compensation Committee considered the accomplishments of each Named Executive Officer, based on his or her individual strategic achievements.

Equity Compensation: Performance Shares and Stock Options
The objective of our equity compensation program is to link our Named Executive Officers' pay delivery with the long-term interests of our stockholders as well as Gilead's performance over the long-term. The long-term equity incentive component of our executive compensation program is entirely performance-based and in 2018 consisted of (i) performance shares that may be earned only upon the achievement of pre-established revenue and relative TSR goals and (ii) options, which require our common stock to appreciate in value before our executive officers realize any economic benefit.
2018 Annual Equity Award Decisions
The equity awards for Dr. Milligan were recommended by our Compensation Committee and ratified by the independent members of our Board and were based on the following considerations:
Dr. Milligan recommended to our Compensation Committee that equity awards in the amounts set forth below be granted to the Named Executive Officers (other than himself). Our Compensation Committee also evaluated each Named Executive Officer's performance during the prior year, his or her expected future contributions, our performance compared to the competitive market and Dr. Milligan's recommendation.

[END TABLE]
2018 Performance Share Awards
Consistent with prior years, the performance share awards granted by our Compensation Committee in 2018 were divided into two equally weighted tranches: one subject to relative TSR performance conditions and one subject to three annual revenue-based performance goals. Our Compensation Committee selected relative TSR and revenue as our performance measures because they drive the key behaviors that it wants to reinforce and ensure alignment of pay delivery with stockholder returns. Our Compensation Committee conducts a thorough review of the performance measures and associated payout levels, the rigor of the performance goals, and the alignment with performance at the time of grant.
Relative TSR Portion. The performance-based vesting requirement for the relative TSR performance shares is tied to the percentile level of our TSR for the three-year performance period from February 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 relative to the 37 companies comprising the S&P Healthcare Sub-Index. The S&P Healthcare Sub-Index was selected for comparison because it enables our Compensation Committee to assess our performance against an objective peer group.
If our absolute TSR is negative, the vesting opportunity is capped at 100% of target, regardless of our relative performance. To receive the earned shares, an executive officer must generally remain employed with us through the date when our Compensation Committee certifies performance achievement.
Absolute Revenue Portion. One-third of the shares subject to the revenue-based performance shares are tied to achievement of our 2018 net product revenue goal, one-third are tied to a 2019 net product revenue goal and one-third are tied to a 2020 net product revenue goal. Each year's net product revenue goal is established by our Compensation Committee in the first quarter of that year, and the payout level can range from 0% to 200% of target allocated to each year's goal. Awards do not become vested until the final performance results are certified in early 2021. Revenue is a key objective due to our historically high margin commercialized products and the strategic importance of research and development investment that could be compromised by overemphasis on profitability. The uncertainty of many external factors that influence our business and industry, such as unanticipated pricing pressures, product-approval timing and volatility in the foreign currency exchange rates, make it difficult to forecast net product revenue beyond a one-year period. As a result, our Compensation Committee has determined that the current design appropriately measures performance over the long-term, as it provides line of sight for our executive officers while making the value delivery contingent on three-year absolute TSR performance. For purposes of determining the achievement level, any product revenue realized during the fiscal year by any entity that we acquired during that year and the effect of any accounting change is excluded. In January 2018, our Compensation Committee established the net product revenue performance goal of $21.0 billion (at target) for 2018.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation introduced authorized generic versions of certain HCV products through our separate subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, to improve access to our medications and lower list prices. The same 2018 net product revenue performance goal also applies to one-third of the revenue-based performance shares granted in 2017 and in 2016.
2018 Stock Options
Our Compensation Committee believes that stock options provide an appropriate incentive for our executives because they will realize value only if our stock price appreciates, which benefits all stockholders. Stock options granted to our Named Executive Officers vest over a four-year service period. One-quarter of the shares of our common stock subject to these options vest one year from the grant date and the remaining shares vest in equal quarterly installments thereafter (assuming the continued service of the executive officer over the next three years).
2016 Performance Share Awards Earned
In January 2016, our Compensation Committee granted to our then-current Named Executive Officers performance share awards, that were subject to a three-year performance period and continued employment through certification of performance achievement:
In February 2019, our Compensation Committee certified final performance achievements for the 2016 performance share awards. Our three-year relative TSR was at the 31st percentile, resulting in a payout of 29% of target for the TSR-based awards. Our net product revenue missed the revenue goal in 2016 but exceeded the target revenue goal in 2017 and 2018, resulting in a payout of 147% of target for the revenue-based awards.

Pay Actions Related to Leadership Transition
Dr. Milligan
During 2018, Dr. Milligan received standard compensation increases consistent with our executive compensation program. For 2018, our Compensation Committee approved an equity award valued at $11,750,000, representing an increase of 2% from 2017, and a base salary increase of 3%. In addition, the Committee approved a corporate bonus payment of $3,341,100 tied solely to our achievement of our 2018 corporate financial and operational performance objectives. The following table shows the actual compensation value approved and awarded to Dr. Milligan for 2017 and 2018, excluding the 2018 share-based accounting expense associated with his departure which is described below. Overall, Dr. Milligan's approved 2018 compensation represented a 2% increase from 2017.
Separation Agreement
In order to assist with a smooth transition following the announcement that Dr. Milligan would step down as President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Milligan agreed to stay with Gilead in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer until December 31, 2018 and as an executive advisor from January 1, 2019 to March 1, 2019.
In recognition of his long service and succession planning support, our Board approved a separation agreement with Dr. Milligan. Under the agreement, Dr. Milligan will receive the pre-determined payments under our Severance Plan, described in further detail under "2018 Potential Payments Upon Involuntary Termination or Change in Control Termination," a 2019 bonus for his transition services and the reimbursement of Dr. Milligan's legal fees incurred in negotiating the agreement.
The separation agreement also provided for the acceleration of his unvested stock options (all of which were underwater) and continued vesting on all unvested performance share awards. Although $9.2 million in incremental expenses was included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the equity modification, Dr. Milligan did not realize or receive any intrinsic value from these awards in 2018 and their realizable value is dependent upon future revenue and stock price performance. These severance benefits demonstrate our executives' and directors' confidence in our future performance and commitment to aligning compensation with stockholder value. The treatment of Dr. Milligan's equity awards aligns with what many of our peers provide under their standard equity benefit plans.
Mr. O'Day – New Hire Offer
Mr. O'Day joined Gilead on March 1, 2019. The key elements of his compensation arrangements are as follows:
Annual Base Salary: $1,600,000 per year.
Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity: Targeted at 150% of his base salary, with a maximum opportunity equal to 150% of target.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
Long-Term Incentive: For 2019, Mr. O'Day received an annual equity award comprising of (i) stock options with a grant date value of $3,000,000; (ii) restricted stock units with a grant date value of $3,000,000; and (iii) performance shares with a target grant date value of $6,000,000.
"Make Whole" Payments: We provided the following "make whole" payments, which are intended to compensate Mr. O'Day for compensation and other benefits forfeited when he left his employer of 30 years to accept our offer. Our intent was to parallel the form and timing of the forfeited payments so that Mr. O'Day was no better off or worse off than if he had remained with his former employer:
Ms. Hamill – New Hire Offer
Ms. Hamill joined Gilead on August 27, 2018. The key elements of her compensation arrangement are as follows:
Annual Base Salary: $950,000 per year.
Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity: Targeted at 95% of the base salary, with a maximum opportunity equal to 150% of target.
"Make Whole" Payments: We also awarded the following "make whole" payments to compensate Ms. Hamill for foregone equity awards with her prior employer:
One-Time Cash Payment: As an additional inducement to accept our employment offer, Ms. Hamill is eligible to receive a one-time bonus in the aggregate amount of $3,000,000. Fifty percent of this cash bonus was paid in September of 2018 and the remainder will be paid on the first anniversary of her employment start date. Ms. Hamill is obligated to return a pro-rata portion of the full bonus if her employment is terminated for Cause or she resigns without Good Reason prior to completing one full year of service. In the event of the termination of her employment without Cause or her resignation for Good Reason, Ms. Hamill will be entitled to receive any unpaid portion of this bonus.
Performance-Based Retention Program
Our Board determined that in order to promote continuity and stability through our Chief Executive Officer transition process, while also providing an incentive for key employees to drive long-term stockholder value, it was appropriate to approve a one-time performance-based cash retention award for certain Gilead officers and, for a limited period of time, to enhance severance benefits in case covered executives subsequently experienced a covered termination event under our Severance Plan. Ms. Washington, Dr. McHutchison and Mr. Alton received performance-based cash retention awards, in which they could earn specified amounts based on the achievement of TSR performance targets over two years and the opportunity to achieve 50% of payment early, after the first year, based on our actual TSR performance.

Other Executive Compensation Policies and Practices
Gilead's Compensation Philosophy, Goals and Principles
Compensation Philosophy
Our executive compensation program is built on six fundamental principles that reflect the nature of our business and industry:
We maintain "best-in-class" governance standards pertaining to the oversight of our executive compensation program. As in prior years, the following policies and practices were in effect during 2018:
Role of Chief Executive Officer
Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation for our Named Executive Officers other than himself. In formulating his recommendations, our Chief Executive Officer reviews internal base salary data and external compensation data provided by our Human Resources Department. The Human Resources Department has engaged Compensia Inc. ("Compensia"), a national compensation consulting firm, to provide comparable market data, including tally sheets, financial performance reports, market compensation reviews and other analyses to aid our Chief Executive Officer in developing his recommendations. During 2018, Compensia served solely as a consultant to management in the compensation decision-making process. When setting 2018 compensation levels, our Compensation Committee placed considerable weight on our former Chief Executive Officer's compensation recommendations because of his direct knowledge of each Named Executive Officer's performance and contributions.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
Role of Compensation Consultant
Our Compensation Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), a national compensation consulting firm, as its independent compensation consultant. FW Cook reports directly to our Compensation Committee, which has the direct authority to appoint, compensate, oversee the work of and dismiss its compensation consultant. George Paulin, Chairman of FW Cook, attends meetings of our Compensation Committee, as requested. FW Cook provides various executive compensation services to our Compensation Committee, including advising our Compensation Committee on the principal aspects of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and evolving industry practices, and providing market information and analyses regarding the competitiveness of our program design for both our executive officers and the non-employee members of our Board. During 2018, FW Cook served solely as a consultant to our Compensation Committee and did not provide any other services to Gilead.
Our Compensation Committee has determined that FW Cook is independent and the work of FW Cook on behalf of our Compensation Committee did not raise any conflict of interest based on the six factors for assessing independence and identifying potential conflicts of interest as set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1(b)(4), the listing standards of Nasdaq and such other factors as were deemed relevant under the circumstances.
Use of Market Data
Individual compensation levels and opportunities for our Named Executive Officers are compared to a peer group of biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies headquartered in the United States that are most similar to us in terms of business strategy, labor market competition, market capitalization, revenue and number of employees. Our compensation peer group for 2018, which was identified based on these objective selection criteria and remained unchanged from our compensation peer group for 2017 comprised these 10 companies:
The following chart represents our position relative to our peer group on three key selection criteria at the time the 2018 compensation peer group was approved in July 2017 (based on publicly available information as of June 2017).
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Revenue in $ millions (as of June 30, 2017)       Market Capitalization in $ millions (as of June 30, 2017)       Worldwide Headcount (as of FYE 2016) 
[END TABLE]
Our compensation peer group includes companies we believe are most similar to us in terms of business complexity and product life cycle. We also include companies that fall within specified revenue and market capitalization ranges. These ranges are broad enough to ensure we can maintain a sufficient number of peer companies. This is especially important as our industry experiences a number of mergers and acquisitions each year, thereby reducing the number of relevant peer company choices. Our Compensation Committee reviews the companies in our compensation peer group annually and makes adjustments as necessary to ensure the comparator companies properly reflect the market in which we compete for executive talent. We also review the executive pay practices of similarly situated companies as reported in industry surveys and reports. In practice, our Compensation Committee has not targeted a specific percentile relative to our compensation peer group for individual components of our total compensation. Instead, we take a holistic perspective in establishing total compensation for our executive officers, taking into account internal pay equity that recognizes the relative experience, responsibilities and individual capabilities in addition to external market compensation practices.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
Use of Tally Sheets
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews tally sheets in its evaluation of the total compensation provided to each Named Executive Officer. These tally sheets estimate dollar amounts for each compensation component, including current cash compensation (base salary and annual bonus), outstanding vested and unvested equity awards, employee benefits, perquisites and other personal benefits and potential severance payments and benefits.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Eligible employees (including our executive officers) can enroll in our Deferred Compensation Plan and defer a portion of their base salaries and part or all their annual bonuses and commissions. Gilead does not provide any matching contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Each participant may direct the investment of his or her deferred compensation account balance into investment choices that mirror substantially all the investment funds available under the Section 401(k) plan. None of these investment alternatives result in "above-market" interest for disclosure purposes. For further information on the deferred compensation arrangements of our Named Executive Officers, see the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" on page 72 below.
In addition, our executive officers may defer receipt of the shares of our common stock that they earn under their performance share awards.
Benefits and Perquisites
We provide medical and other benefits to our executive officers that are generally available to other full-time employees, including participation in our employee stock purchase plan, group term life insurance plan and a Section 401(k) savings plan. Under the Section 401(k) plan, we make matching contributions on behalf of each participant equal to 100% of his or her contributions to the plan, up to an annual maximum matching contribution of $10,000 (increased to $12,000 for 2019). All of our executive officers participated in the Section 401(k) plan during 2018 and received matching contributions.
We do not provide defined benefit retirement plans, post-retirement health coverage or any other supplemental retiree benefits for our executive officers or employees. We generally do not provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers.
For further information on the perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our Named Executive Officers during 2018, see the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 62.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We have stock ownership guidelines that require each Named Executive Officer to maintain a stock ownership level equal to a specified multiple of his or her annual base salary, as set forth in the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer    Individuals newly hired or promoted are allowed a specified number of years to comply with their ownership guidelines.

Executive Compensation
Clawback Policy
We maintain a compensation recovery or "clawback" policy under which our Board has the authority to recoup any bonus or other cash or equity compensation based on restated financial results from any executive officer or other covered individual whose misconduct contributed to an obligation to file the financial restatement.
Hedging and Pledging Prohibitions
We maintain an insider trading policy applicable to all employees, including our Named Executive Officers, which prohibits hedging transactions in our common stock as well as pledging of Gilead securities.
Severance Benefits
We maintain the Gilead Sciences, Inc. Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") that offers severance payments and benefits to all our employees, including our executive officers, upon certain involuntary terminations of employment. The intent of our Severance Plan is to serve the following purposes:
In addition, the Severance Plan prohibits "gross-up" payments on any excise tax imposed on any change in control benefits for all executive officers.
As part of their retention awards, in September 2018, Ms. Washington, Dr. McHutchison and Mr. Alton each also became eligible for enhanced severance benefits under the Gilead Sciences, Inc. Retention Program for Executive Officers (the "Retention Program"). Under this program, covered executive officers are entitled to additional cash severance and enhanced equity vesting in the event of a qualifying termination of employment on or prior to September 12, 2020.
For further information about the Severance Plan and the Retention Program, see "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements with Named Executive Officers" on page 58.
Compensation-Related Risk
Our Compensation Committee and its independent consultant, with input from our Human Resources Department, annually reviews the compensation program to determine whether it encourages excessive risk-taking that would create a material risk to the company's economic viability. As part of this review, our Compensation Committee specifically considers (i) the balance of the program including the appropriate mix of short- and long-term goals and incentives; (ii) whether the appropriate controls and governance policies are in place to manage risk; and (iii) whether broad-based employee incentive plans (including sales plans) have appropriate leverage and do not drive undue risk taking.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
Based on this annual review, our Compensation Committee concluded it was not reasonably likely that any of our compensation policies and practices in place during 2018, whether individually or in aggregate, would have a material adverse effect upon Gilead. As discussed in prior years, our Compensation Committee considered the following factors:
For the foregoing reasons, our Compensation Committee has concluded that it was not reasonably likely that our overall employee compensation structure, when analyzed either in terms of its company-wide application or its specific application to our various major business units, would have a material adverse effect upon Gilead.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows an income tax deduction to publicly traded companies for compensation paid to or realized by any "covered employee" to the extent that this compensation exceeds $1 million per covered individual in any taxable year. Prior to being amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") in December 2017, there was an exception from the $1 million limitation of Section 162(m) for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation," and Section 162(m) applied only to our Chief Executive Officer and other Named Executive Officers who were employed at year end (other than our Chief Financial Officer). The TCJA amended Section 162(m) to generally eliminate the exception for performance-based compensation, effective for taxable years following December 31, 2017, unless such compensation is provided pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not thereafter materially modified. The TCJA also expanded Section 162(m) to apply to a public company's chief financial officer and to apply even once a covered employee ceases to be an executive officer.
Stock option and performance share awards for our executive officers granted prior to November 2, 2017 were structured with the intent to qualify the awards as "performance-based compensation." Our Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation as just one of many factors in determining compensation components and has amended, and may in the future amend, such equity awards in a manner that results in a loss of grandfathered status under the TCJA. For 2018 and future compensation years, we expect that new compensation arrangements with covered employees will be subject to the $1 million limit on deductibility.

Severance and Change in Control Arrangements with Named Executive Officers
Although the employment of the Named Executive Officers is "at will," they are eligible to receive certain severance payments and benefits upon their termination of employment under certain defined circumstances. There are four general categories of termination:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Voluntary Termination/For Cause Termination: includes a voluntary termination of employment by the Named Executive Officer (other than in connection with a  resignation for good reason) and a termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment by us for cause.   
[END TABLE]
For purposes of determining a Named Executive Officer's eligibility for the various severance payments and benefits available under the Severance Plan, the Retention Program, and our various equity plans, the following definitions are relevant:
A "change in control of Gilead" will be deemed to occur upon:
Under our equity awards, a "resignation for good reason" will be deemed to occur should a Named Executive Officer resign from his or her employment with us for any of the following reasons during the applicable change in control protection period:

Under the Retention Program, a "resignation for good reason" will be deemed to occur should a Named Executive Officer resign from his or her employment with us upon the occurrence of:
A Named Executive Officer's employment will be deemed to have been terminated for "cause" if such termination occurs by reason of:
Dr. Milligan's Separation Agreement and Release
On August 6, 2018, we entered into a Separation Agreement and Release (the "Separation Agreement") with Dr. Milligan that provides for specified payments and benefits in connection with Dr. Milligan's agreement to stay with Gilead and serve as President and Chief Executive Officer position until December 31, 2018, and as an executive advisor from January 1, 2019 to March 1, 2019. In particular, the Separation Agreement provides for:
The following table summarizes the payments and benefits that each Named Executive Officer, excluding Dr. Milligan, was eligible to receive upon his or her termination of employment under the various circumstances specified above as of December 31, 2018.
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For equity awards granted in 2018 and prior years, retirement is defined as the termination of a Named Executive Officer's employment with a combined age and years of service of not less than 70 years. As of December 31, 2018, only Dr. Milligan and Mr. Alton met the retirement definition. 
(2)  The change in control protection period would begin with the execution of the definitive agreement for the change in control transaction and continue for a specified period following the effective date of the change in control transaction (24 months for Dr. Milligan and 18 months for the other Named Executive Officers). 
(3)  Ms. Hamill is also entitled to these benefits upon a termination of her employment for Good Reason. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation
A Named Executive Officer must deliver a general release of claims against Gilead as a condition of his or her receipt of payments and benefits under the Severance Plan or Retention Program. The cash severance component of those arrangements will be paid in a series of equal periodic installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices over a period of years corresponding to the applicable multiple of base salary indicated above for the Named Executive Officer. However, a portion of those installments may be subject to a six-month holdback to the extent required under applicable tax laws.
The estimated severance payments and benefits for which a Named Executive Officer will become eligible if his or her employment terminated under these various scenarios are set forth in the table below. The estimated amounts assume:
The table below does not include accrued wages, vacation pay, vested deferred compensation or the intrinsic value (as of December 31, 2018) of any outstanding stock options or other stock awards held by the Named Executive Officer that were vested on that date. Due to the number of different factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided in connection with these events, actual amounts payable to any of the Named Executive Officers should a separation from service or change in control occur during the year will likely differ, perhaps significantly, from the amounts reported below. Factors that could affect such amounts include the timing during the year of the event, our stock price, target amounts payable under annual and long-term incentive arrangements that are in place at the time of the event, and the executive's age and prevailing tax rates.

(1)  Includes amounts earned but deferred at the election of the Named Executive Officer pursuant to our 401(k) employee savings and retirement plan or our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. 
(2)  Represents the aggregate grant-date fair value of the stock options awarded to the Named Executive Officer for the applicable year, calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718"), and does not take into account estimated forfeitures. Assumptions used in the calculation of such grant-date fair values are set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year. 
(3)  Represents amounts paid under our corporate bonus plan based on our Compensation Committee's certification of corporate performance and individual achievements. 
(4)  As announced in July 2018, Dr. Milligan stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer in December 2018. 
(5)  Under the separation agreement we entered into with Dr. Milligan in August 2018 (the "Separation Agreement"), we accelerated the vesting of Dr. Milligan's unvested stock options as of March 1, 2019 and waived the continuous service condition on his outstanding performance share awards to provide for full settlement based on actual performance over the applicable performance periods. On the date of the Separation Agreement, the incremental fair values of Dr. Milligan's stock awards and option awards determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 were $6,542,143 and $5,256,356, respectively. These amounts were included in the table above, with the exception of $2,610,851, which represents the incremental fair value on the date of modification of certain performance shares for which performance objectives have not been set and is subject to change based on our stock price at the applicable reporting period. 
  Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, in 2018, we reimbursed Dr. Milligan's legal fees in the amount of $32,056, reported in All Other Compensation column. 
  Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, in 2019, we commenced cash payments to Dr. Milligan in the aggregate amount of $8,285,000 (payable in twenty-four monthly installments) in exchange for his execution of a release of claims. The $8,285,000 was excluded from the table above since the first payment started in March 2019. 
(6)  Represents the aggregate grant-date fair value of the performance shares determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. This reported value of the stock awards differs from the award values approved by our Compensation Committee because of changes in our stock price between the date of such approval and the time when the performance objectives are established. In addition, the reported values include awards our Compensation Committee approved in 2016 and 2017. The aggregate grant-date fair values of the awards reported for 2018 (the TSR tranche of the 2018 performance shares, the 2018 revenue subtranches of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 performance shares) assuming maximum attainment of the applicable performance goals in effect for those tranches and subtranches, are as follows: John F. Milligan ($8,931,331), Robin L. Washington ($2,890,684), Gregg H. Alton ($2,237,437) and John G. McHutchison ($1,930,695). As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the revenue subtranches of the 2017 and 2018 performance shares for which performance objectives have not yet been set do not at present have a reportable grant-date fair value under FASB ASC Topic 718. The grant-date fair values assume maximum goal attainment only as to those tranches or subtranches that at present have a reportable grant-date fair value. Assumptions used in the calculation of such grant-date fair values are set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year.

2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table sets forth certain additional information regarding grants of plan-based awards to our Named Executive Officers for the 2018 fiscal year:

Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Actual amounts paid in February 2019 were based on our Compensation Committee's review and certification of corporate performance and individual achievements in 2018 and are included in the "Non-Equity  Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 62. 
(2)   Performance shares and restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2004 Plan accrue forfeitable dividend equivalents that are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding  performance shares and restricted stock unit awards. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid in cash when the underlying shares vest. Amounts in the "Threshold" column represent the number of shares of our common stock issuable (e.g.,  20% of the target number of performance shares allotted to the revenue tranche and 0.025% of the target number of performance shares allotted to the TSR tranche) upon threshold-level achievement of the performance goals described in footnotes 6 through 8  below. If threshold-level performance is not achieved, no shares are issuable. 
(3)   These awards, with the exception of certain awards to Dr. McHutchison and Ms. Hamill, were approved by our Compensation Committee on January 31, 2018 with a grant date of February 1, 2018. The options and awards  to Ms. Hamill were approved on October 7, 2018 with a grant date of October 7, 2018. Certain options and awards to Dr. McHutchison were approved on May 8, 2018 with a grant date of May 8, 2018. 
(4)   Reflects option awards granted under our 2004 Plan, the terms of which are consistent with those of options granted to other employees under the 2004 Plan. The options vest at the rate of 25% on the first  anniversary of the grant date and 6.25% each quarter thereafter during the optionee's employment over the next 36 months thereafter. Subject to earlier forfeiture, the maximum term of options granted under the 2004 Plan is 10 years. The exercise  price per share of each option granted was equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date or the closing market price on the day before the grant date if the grant date is not on a business day. 
(6)   Represents the grant-date fair value of the 2018 revenue subtranche of performance shares awarded in 2016 under our 2004 Plan, as that value was measured on February 1, 2018, which was the date on which the  revenue target for that particular subtranche was first communicated to the Named Executive Officer (following approval by our Compensation Committee). Although such subtranche was part of the performance share award originally made on February 1, 2016,  no grant-date fair value could be determined for that subtranche under FASB ASC Topic 718 until February 1, 2018.

One award, that includes 32,795 units, contains terms that are  consistent with time-based restricted stock unit awards under the 2004 Plan. The other award, that includes 52,470 units, was divided into four tranches with the vesting of each tranche tied to the attainment of specified individual performance  objectives and Ms. Hamill's continued employment for each tranche. 
(12)   Represents Ms. Hamill's target and maximum bonus which was pro-rated based on her August 27, 2018 start date. 
(13)   Represents restricted stock unit awards granted to Dr. McHutchison under the 2004 Plan in connection with his appointment to the position of Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Research and Development.

Executive Compensation
CEO Pay Ratio
We present below the ratio of annual total compensation of our median compensated employee to the annual total compensation of our former Chief Executive Officer for 2018.
The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
In identifying our median paid employee, we applied the following steps:
The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for Dr. Milligan was $25,961,831, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our median employee was $163,963. The ratio of Dr. Milligan's annual total compensation to our median employee's total annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 158 to 1. As discussed in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Dr. Milligan's 2018 compensation includes one-time charges related to the treatment of his equity awards under his separation agreement (see Pay Actions Related to Leadership Transition). Excluding these charges, the 2018 annual total compensation for Dr. Milligan was $16,774,182 and the ratio between this amount and our median employee's 2018 annual total compensation is 102 to 1. We believe this supplemental ratio reflects a more representative comparison of Dr. Milligan's pay to our median employee's pay.

   Stockholder Proposal Requesting that the Board Adopt a Policy that the Chairperson of the Board of Directors be an Independent Director John Chevedden has submitted a stockholder proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden's address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278. We have been notified that Mr. Chevedden has continuously held 100 shares of our common stock since July 1, 2017. If properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" the following proposal. The resolution being submitted by Mr. Chevedden to the stockholders for approval is as follows: Stockholder Proposal Proposal 5 – Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic received 45%-support at our 2018 annual meeting. This likely translates into 51%-support from the shareholders who had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal is more important to Gilead Sciences shareholders because our stock price fell from $75 to $66 in the 5-years leading up to the due date for this proposal. Our current insider Chairman John Martin had 11-years long-tenure as Chairman which can further erode any independence inclination. Our Lead Director John Cogan had 14-years long-tenure which is not a sign of independence. Executive pay received 89%-support when many companies obtain 95%-support. This could be an indication of having the wrong incentives in the executive pay package. An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of the Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent. Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 5

Our current insider Chairman John Martin had 11-years long-tenure as Chairman which can further erode any independence inclination. Our Lead Director John Cogan had 14-years long-tenure which is not a sign of independence. Executive pay received 89%-support when many companies obtain 95%-support. This could be an indication of having the wrong incentives in the executive pay package. An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of the Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent. Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 5 
   Stockholder Proposal Requesting that the Board Adopt a Policy that the Chairperson of the Board of Directors be an Independent Director John Chevedden has submitted a stockholder proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Chevedden's address is 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278. We have been notified that Mr. Chevedden has continuously held 100 shares of our common stock since July 1, 2017. If properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" the following proposal. The resolution being submitted by Mr. Chevedden to the stockholders for approval is as follows: Stockholder Proposal Proposal 5 – Independent Board Chairman Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic received 45%-support at our 2018 annual meeting. This likely translates into 51%-support from the shareholders who had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal is more important to Gilead Sciences shareholders because our stock price fell from $75 to $66 in the 5-years leading up to the due date for this proposal. Our current insider Chairman John Martin had 11-years long-tenure as Chairman which can further erode any independence inclination. Our Lead Director John Cogan had 14-years long-tenure which is not a sign of independence. Executive pay received 89%-support when many companies obtain 95%-support. This could be an indication of having the wrong incentives in the executive pay package. An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of the Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent. Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 5

Stockholder Proposals
Our Board Recommends a Vote AGAINST this Proposal.
Board's View Aligns with Recent Stockholder Votes on this Issue
In 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018, our Board carefully considered stockholder proposals requesting that our Board adopt a policy that the Chairperson of the Board be an independent director. In each of those votes, the majority of shares were voted AGAINST the proposals. Our Board continues to believe that stockholder interests are best served when the Board has the flexibility to determine the best person to serve as Chairperson, whether that person is an independent director, a director employed by Gilead or another person, and recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.
The Board Should Have Flexibility to Structure an Appropriate Governance Structure Tailored to the Needs of Gilead
Our Board has the flexibility to design Gilead's board leadership structure as our Board deems appropriate based on the circumstances at the time. Our policy enables our Board to choose a leadership structure that can be tailored to the strengths of Gilead's officers and directors and best addresses Gilead's evolving and highly complex business. Departing from Gilead's current policy would unduly impair our Board's ability to select the director it believes is best suited to serve as Chairperson based on the circumstances at the time.
Our Board has determined that it is currently in the best interests of Gilead to partner a powerful Lead Independent Director with our Chair of the Board. Our Board actively reviews this structure to ensure that it continues to serve the best interests of Gilead.
Currently, Having Mr. O'Day as our Chair of the Board is in the Best Interests of Gilead and its Stockholders
Our Board believes that it is currently in the best interests of Gilead and its stockholders for Mr. O'Day to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board because it best positions Mr. O'Day to effectively drive future strategy and decision-making for our organization. In addition to public, private and non-profit board experience, Mr. O'Day has a track record of success in highly scientific and competitive therapeutic areas, deep understanding of the evolving healthcare environment around the world and unwavering commitment to driving innovation across all aspects of a business.
Gilead's leadership needs may change over time, and we expect our Board to shape our leadership structure accordingly.
Our Lead Independent Director and Our Strong Governance Structures Ensure our Board's Independent Leadership and Accountability
We believe the robust duties of our Lead Independent Director empower our independent directors to provide effective guidance, challenge and oversight of management. The role of Lead Independent Director at Gilead is modeled on the role of an independent Chairperson, ensuring a strong, independent and active Board of Directors. As set forth in the Lead Independent Charter adopted by our Board, the Lead Independent Director has clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. These duties include:

Stockholder Proposals
In addition, as required by our Board Guidelines, Gilead's independent directors meet without executive management on a routine basis to review, among other things, Gilead's strategy, performance, management effectiveness and succession planning.
Finally, Gilead's strong corporate governance policies and practices provide our independent directors with the ability to effectively oversee our management.

Stockholder Proposals
We believe that the interests of our stockholders will be best served by maintaining our Board's flexibility in determining the board leadership structure that is best suited to the needs of Gilead at any particular time.

Stockholder Proposal
Corporate Tax Savings Allocation Disclosure
WHEREAS: The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanently reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and eliminated provisions requiring companies pay taxes on money earned abroad. With these changes it is estimated that America's largest corporations by market capitalization will receive a windfall of $150 billion.1 One of the overarching goals of the legislation is to boost economic growth and companies' long-term investment in the American economy, however without more detailed information it is unclear whether a company's intended use of the assets aligns with this goal.
To date, Gilead has not provided adequate information indicating how the company plans to use tax savings gained as a result of the TCJA.
We believe investors should have ample information regarding how changes to the tax law will impact a company's long-term strategy. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock recently stated:
"Companies have not been explicit enough about their long-term strategies. In the United States, for example, companies should explain to investors how the significant changes to tax law fit into their long-term strategy. What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use it to create long-term value? This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors."
The tax cuts present Gilead with an opportunity to strengthen the bottom line, invest in workers, benefits, jobs, communities, capital investments, R&D, and make acquisitions. Without any specificity or discussion of these investments, investors cannot understand how the tax law will impact a company's long-term strategy.
Motivated by the tax changes, industry peer Amgen announced plans to open a biologics plant adding 300 new jobs.2 Dozens of companies have also shared how they will spend the tax savings. Boeing will use the funds on workforce development, infrastructure enhancement, and corporate giving.3 Target plans to use 100 percent of its tax savings on workers.
The focus on what companies do with tax benefits is growing during a time when wage growth remains stagnant and income inequality has widened.

Stockholder Proposals
In a poll, when Americans were asked what percentage of corporate tax savings should be allocated to seven categories, responses indicated that fifty-two percent thought tax savings should go towards worker pay and/or benefits, creating new jobs, and giving back to communities. Passing savings onto shareholders was the lowest priority at just 10 percent.
Earlier this year Illinois Treasurer Frerichs and JUST Capital issued a survey to S&P 100 companies with a series of questions regarding planned allocation of corporate tax savings. Gilead declined to complete the survey.
RESOLVED: Shareholders request the board of directors to issue a report describing how the company plans to allocate tax savings as a result of the TCJA. This report should be prepared at reasonable cost, in a reasonable time, and omit proprietary information.
Our Board Recommends a Vote AGAINST this Proposal.
Our Board carefully considered the stockholder proposal and does not believe the production of the type of report described in the proposal would be a productive use of corporate resources or in the best interest of Gilead or its stockholders.
Although we did not complete the questionnaire issued by Illinois Treasurer Frerichs and JUST Capital regarding planned allocation of corporate tax savings ("Questionnaire"), we provided Treasurer Frerichs and JUST Capital information about the impact of the TCJA on Gilead's business. For example, we noted we expect to further grow our business in the United States which will create significant career opportunities for both existing and new employees and the communities where we do business. Specifically, we plan to continue the expansion of our Foster City, California headquarters, through a combination of new construction and sustainable renovations. In addition, we are seeking additional U.S.-based facilities to house our growing employee base, including new research and manufacturing facilities in California and Maryland to support our cellular therapy operations. We also expect to expand our U.S.-based manufacturing, which will create additional jobs in the United States.
Our Board believes that preparing and issuing a formal report of the type requested in the proposal would require substantial time and expense without significant benefit to our stockholders. We are frequently asked by interest groups to prepare reports and disclose information in various formats and levels of detail related to issues of importance to them. Compiling this information is expensive and time consuming and directs corporate resources away from activities that build stockholder value. Our Board also believes that the preparation of the report would not cause us to modify our corporate tax strategy or the investments we make in our business.
Our Board therefore recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal as it is not in the best interests of Gilead or its stockholders.

Stock Ownership Information
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to provide to us copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to these executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders.

Householding of Proxy Materials
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other Annual Meeting materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice or other Annual Meeting materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as householding, potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A Notice will be delivered in one single envelope to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If you hold your shares through a broker and would prefer to receive a separate Notice, please notify your broker. If you hold your shares directly and would prefer to receive a separate Notice, please submit a written request to Gilead Sciences, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 333 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, California 94404 or contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at (866) 540-7095. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the Notice to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.
By Order of the Board of Directors,
March 25, 2019
A copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is available without charge upon written request to Investor Relations, Gilead Sciences, Inc., 333 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, California 94404 or by accessing a copy through Gilead's website at http://www.gilead.com on the Investors page under "SEC Filings."
Table of Contents
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders of record. This approach conserves natural resources and reduces our costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials, while providing stockholders with a convenient way to access our proxy materials. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or to request a printed set of the proxy materials, including a proxy card. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice.

7.   What are the voting requirements to elect the directors and to approve each of the proposals discussed in this Proxy Statement? 
[END TABLE]
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if a majority of the outstanding shares is represented by votes present at the meeting in person or by proxy. Shares represented by proxies marked "abstain" and "broker non-votes" are counted in determining whether a quorum is present. A "broker non-vote" is a proxy submitted by a broker that does not indicate a vote for some of the proposals because the broker does not have discretionary voting authority on certain types of proposals and has not received instructions from its client as to how to vote on a particular proposal.
If your shares are held by a broker and you do not indicate how you wish to vote, your broker is permitted to exercise its discretion to vote your shares only on certain "routine" matters. Proposal 2 is a "routine" matter. As a result, your broker is permitted to exercise discretionary voting authority to vote your shares for this proposal. Your broker may not exercise discretionary voting authority and may not vote your shares with respect to the other proposals unless you provide your broker with voting instructions.
With respect to Proposal 1, abstentions will not have an effect on the outcome of the vote. With respect to Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, abstentions will have the same effect as an "against" vote. "Broker non-votes" will have no effect on Proposals 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. "Broker non-votes" will have the same effect as an "against" vote with respect to Proposal 3.

8.  How do I vote? 
[END TABLE]
You may vote in person by attending the meeting or by completing and returning a proxy by mail, by telephone or electronically using the Internet. If your shares are registered directly in your name with Gilead's transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a "stockholder of record." If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." Most beneficial owners whose stock is held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee receive instructions for how to vote their shares from their banks, brokers or other nominees, rather than our proxy card. You can vote your shares held through a bank, broker or other nominee by following the voting instructions sent to you by that institution.
By mail
To vote your proxy by mail, be sure to complete, sign and date the proxy card (if you request one) or voting instruction card that may be delivered to you and return it in the envelope provided. We will vote your shares as directed. However, if you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the persons named on the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy as recommended by our Board.
By Internet or telephone
Stockholders may vote their shares using the Internet or telephone. The law of the State of Delaware, under which we are incorporated, specifically permits electronically transmitted proxies so long as each such proxy contains or is submitted with information from which the inspector of election can determine that such proxy was authorized by the stockholder. The Internet and telephone voting procedures below are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been recorded properly. Stockholders voting shares via the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which must be borne by the stockholder.
Stockholders of record may go to http://www.proxyvote.com to vote their shares. You will be required to provide the control number printed on your Notice. The votes represented by such proxy will be generated on the computer screen and the voter will be prompted to submit or revise them as desired. Stockholders of record using a touch-tone telephone may vote their shares by calling (800) 690-6903 and following the recorded instructions.
A number of brokers and banks are participating in a program that offers the ability to vote shares over the telephone and Internet. Street name holders may vote on the Internet by accessing http://www.proxyvote.com. You will be required to provide the control number printed on your Notice. Street name holders using a touch-tone telephone may vote their shares by calling (800) 454-8683 and following the recorded instructions.
Internet and telephone voting for stockholders of record and street name holders will be available 24 hours a day, and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 7, 2019. Submitting your proxy via the Internet or by telephone will not affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the Annual Meeting.
In person at the Annual Meeting
Stockholders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Whether or not a stockholder plans to attend the meeting, the stockholder should vote by mail, Internet or telephone to ensure his or her vote is counted. A stockholder may still attend the meeting and vote in person if he or she has already voted by one of these methods. To vote in person, a stockholder may come to the Annual Meeting and we will provide the stockholder with a ballot when he or she arrives. The ballot submitted at the meeting would supersede any prior vote.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you must also obtain a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Your vote is important. You can save us the expense of a second mailing of proxy materials by voting promptly.

Pletcher, the persons named on your proxy card, will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.
Yes. Proxy cards, ballots and voting tabulations that identify stockholders by name are kept confidential. There are exceptions for contested proxy solicitations or when necessary to meet legal requirements. Veaco Group, the independent proxy tabulator that we have engaged, will count the votes and act as the inspector of election for the meeting.
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting.
We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of the Notice and this Proxy Statement and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of our common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of common stock for their out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. We have hired Innisfree M&A Incorporated to act as our proxy solicitor in conjunction with the Annual Meeting. We will pay Innisfree M&A Incorporated a fee of $15,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, for these services. Our solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or personal solicitation by directors, officers or other of our employees. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other employees for such solicitation services performed by them.

The holders of Common Stock may not act by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders except (a) in accordance with this Article VI (including, without limitation, the requirements set forth herein with respect to submitting a request that the Board of Directors fix a record date for determining the stockholders entitled to take such action) or (b) pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors authorizing one or more actions to be taken by written consent. Any written consent to take action in lieu of a meeting of stockholders may be revoked by the stockholder who executed such consent prior to the effectiveness of the stockholder action or actions set forth in such written consent by delivery to the Corporation of a revocation of such consent. References in this Article VI and the Bylaws to a written consent shall be deemed to include a telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken if such transmission complies with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
(b) Request for Record Date. The record date for determining holders of Common Stock entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or otherwise established under this Article VI. Any stockholder seeking to have the holders of Common Stock authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written request addressed to the secretary of the Corporation and delivered to the Corporation and signed by holders of record of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, request that a record date be fixed for such purpose. The written request must contain the information set forth or identified in paragraph (c) of this Article VI. Following receipt of the request, the Board of Directors shall, by the later of (i) 20 days after delivery of a valid request to set a record date and (ii) 5 days after delivery of any information requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of the request for a record date or to determine whether the action to which the request relates may be effected by written consent, determine the validity of the request and whether the request relates to an action that may be taken by written consent pursuant to this Article VI and, if appropriate, may adopt a resolution fixing the record date for such purpose. The record date for such purpose shall be no more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors and shall not precede the date such resolution is adopted. If the request has been determined to be valid and to relate to an action that may be effected by written consent pursuant to this Article VI or if no such determination shall have been made by the date required by this Article VI, and in either event no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date shall be the close of business on the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken by written consent is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Article VI and Section 228 of the DGCL; provided that, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required under the provisions of Delaware law, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. The Board of Directors may fix a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to deliver written requests, whether or not the Corporation has already received one or more written requests pursuant to this Article VI. A request to set a record date for determining the

Appendix A
holders of Common Stock entitled to consent to an action may be revoked by the stockholder who submitted such request by delivery of a revocation of such request to the Corporation at any time prior to the time written requests to set a record date from the holders of 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, submitted in accordance with this Article VI, are received by the Corporation.
(c) Notice Requirements. Any request required by paragraph (b) of this Article VI must be delivered by the holders of record of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (with evidence of such ownership attached to the request, including, if the record holders submitting such request are not the beneficial owners of such shares, evidence that the beneficial owners on whose behalf the request is submitted beneficially own at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock), must be executed by each stockholder of record submitting such request and must describe the action proposed to be taken by written consent of stockholders and must contain (i) such information and representations, to the extent applicable, then required by the Bylaws as though each such stockholder submitting a request was intending to make a nomination or to bring any other matter before a meeting of stockholders and (ii) the text of the proposal(s) (including the text of any resolutions to be adopted by written consent of stockholders and the language of any proposed amendment to the Bylaws of the Corporation). The Corporation may require the stockholder(s) submitting such request to furnish such other information as may be requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of the request for a record date and to determine whether the request relates to an action that may be effected by written consent under this Article VI, the Bylaws and applicable law. In connection with an action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent in accordance with this Article VI, the stockholders seeking such action or actions shall further update and supplement the information previously provided to the Corporation in connection therewith, if necessary, as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to consent to such action or actions as would be required by the Bylaws as of the record date for a meeting of stockholders if such action were a nomination or other matter proposed to be brought before a meeting of stockholders.
(d) Actions Which May Be Taken by Written Consent. The Board of Directors shall not be obligated to set a record date for an action by written consent if (i) the record date request does not, or record date requests were solicited in a manner that did not, comply with this Article VI, the Corporation's Bylaws or applicable law, (ii) such action relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law, (iii) the record date request is delivered during the period commencing 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders and ending on the earlier of (x) the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders or (y) 30 days after the first anniversary of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders, (iv) an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item"), other than the election of directors, was presented at an annual or special meeting of stockholders held not more than 12 months before the record date request is delivered, (v) a Similar Item was presented at an annual or special meeting of stockholders held not more than 90 days before the record date request is delivered (and, for purposes of this clause (v), the election of directors shall be deemed to be a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors, changing the size of the Board of Directors and the filling of vacancies and/or newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors), (vi) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation's notice of meeting as an item of business to be brought before an annual or special meeting of stockholders that has been called but not yet held or that is called for a date within 90 days of the receipt by the Corporation of a record date request, or (vii) the record date request was made, or record date requests were solicited, in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or other applicable law.
(e) Manner of Consent Solicitation. Holders of Common Stock may take action by written consent only if (i) consents are solicited by the stockholder or group of stockholders seeking to take action by written consent of stockholders from all holders of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter pursuant to and in accordance with this Article VI and applicable law and (ii) the solicitation materials delivered by such stockholders include a description of the action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent and, with respect to each person or entity directing such solicitation or on whose behalf such solicitation is made, a description of any material interest of such person or entity in the action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent, as well as any other information required under applicable law.
(f) Delivery of Consents. No consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the first date on which a consent is delivered in the manner required by this Article VI, and not later than 120 days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to consent to such action, consents

signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are so delivered to the Corporation. No consents may be delivered to the Corporation or its registered office in the State of Delaware until 60 days after the delivery of a valid request to set a record date. Consents must be delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by Section 228 of the DGCL. Delivery must be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of consents, the secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall provide for the safe-keeping of such consents and any related revocations and shall promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of all consents and any related revocations and of the validity of the action to be taken by written consent as the secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, as the case may be, deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in consents have given consent; provided, however, that if the action to which the consents relate is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, as the case may be, shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board of Directors, to serve as independent inspectors ("Inspectors") with respect to such consent and such Inspectors shall discharge the functions of the secretary of the Corporation, or such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, as the case may be, under this Article VI. If after such investigation the secretary of the Corporation, such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the Inspectors, as the case may be, shall determine that the action purported to have been taken is duly authorized by the consents, that fact shall be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders and the consents shall be filed in such records. In conducting the investigation required by this section, the secretary of the Corporation, such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the Inspectors, as the case may be, may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors as such person or persons may deem necessary or appropriate and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors.
(g) Effectiveness of Consent. Notwithstanding anything in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, no action may be taken by written consent except in accordance with this Article VI, the Bylaws and applicable law. The Board of Directors shall determine in good faith whether the requirements set forth in this Article VI and the Bylaws have been satisfied. If the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith that any request to fix a record date or any stockholder action by written consent was not properly made in accordance with, or relates to an action that may not be effected by written consent pursuant to, this Article VI, the Bylaws or applicable law, or the stockholder or stockholders seeking to take such action do not otherwise comply with this Article VI, the Bylaws or applicable law, then the Board of Directors shall not be required to fix a record date and any such purported action by written consent shall be null and void to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the secretary of the Corporation, such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, or the Inspectors, as applicable, certify to the Corporation that the consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Article VI, represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, in accordance with Delaware law and this Certificate of Incorporation. The action by written consent will take effect as of the date and time of such certification and will not relate back to the date that the written consents were delivered to the Corporation.
(h) Challenge to Validity of Consent. Nothing contained in this Article VI shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or related revocations, whether before or after such certification by the secretary of the Corporation, such other officer or agent of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the Inspectors, as the case may be, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution, or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
(i) Board-solicited Stockholder Action by Written Consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, (i) none of the foregoing provisions of this Article VI shall apply to any solicitation of stockholder action by written consent by or at the direction of the Board of Directors and (ii) the Board of Directors shall be entitled to solicit stockholder action by written consent in accordance with applicable law.
