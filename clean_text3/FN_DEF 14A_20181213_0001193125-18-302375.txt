Business and Financial Highlights 
During fiscal 2018, we saw a decrease in customers' demand for optical communications manufacturing services, particularly telecom manufacturing services and a slower growth rate in the data center market after a peak year in fiscal 2017, which was partially offset by an increase in customers' demand for non-optical communications manufacturing services. For fiscal 2018, we reported annual revenue of $1,371.9 million, a decrease of $48.6 million, or 3.4%, compared to record annual revenue of $1,420.5 million for fiscal 2017. The following table illustrates our fiscal 2018 results in terms of revenue, gross margin, net income, net income per diluted share and fiscal-end closing share price, relative to fiscal 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Please see the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2018 (filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 22, 2018), for a more detailed discussion  of our fiscal 2018 financial results.  
(2)  Please refer to Appendix A for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP  financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").  
[END TABLE]
Other fiscal 2018 highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We saw record growth from non-optical communications programs during the  fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as we continued to diversify our markets and customer base. Overall revenue from non-optical communications programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was  $103 million, up 30% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and up 13% from the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Both our industrial laser and automotive businesses saw all-time record quarterly revenue in  the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, with industrial laser revenue increasing 36% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and 8% from the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $47 million, and automotive revenue increasing 34% from the fourth quarter of  fiscal 2017 and 20% from the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to $26 million.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In August 2017, we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program to permit us to  repurchase up to $30.0 million worth of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the open market. In February 2018, our board of directors approved an increase of $30.0 million to this share repurchase authorization, bringing the  aggregate authorization to $60.0 million. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 1,289,103 ordinary shares, or approximately $42.4 million worth of our ordinary shares, which offset dilution from issuances under our equity incentive plans.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In September 2017, we hired Seamus Grady as our new Chief Executive Officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In March 2018, we began laying the groundwork for a new facility in Israel, where we expect to continue our  proven model of providing local "new product introduction" services, helping our customers with design for manufacturability, and then transferring those programs to Thailand for volume manufacturing.

Executive Compensation Program Highlights 
Our executive compensation program is designed to be heavily weighted towards compensating our executives based on company performance. To that end, we have implemented executive compensation policies and practices that reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy and align with commonly viewed best practices and sound governance principles. The following chart summarizes these policies and practices: 
What We Do 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Pay-for-performance, with  significant portion of compensation at risk  
✓  Caps on performance-based incentive compensation  
✓  Multi-year performance periods  
✓  Claw back on cash and equity incentive compensation  
✓  Share ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors  
✓  100% independent directors on the Compensation Committee  
✓  Independent compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee  
✓  Annual review and approval of our compensation strategy  
✓  Engagement with shareholders  
✓  Annual shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation   
[END TABLE]
What We Don't Do 
[BEGIN TABLE]
×  No targeting specific percentiles  
×  No guaranteed bonus  
×  No changing of multi-year targets after they are set  
×  No repricing or buyouts of equity awards  
×  No share "recycling"  
×  No short sales, hedging, or pledging of our ordinary shares  
×  No transactions involving derivatives of our ordinary shares  
×  No paying dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested equity awards   
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018. Our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program continued to use key performance measures (revenue and non-GAAP gross margin) to link executive compensation with Fabrinet's performance. Taking into account the results of previous stockholder advisory votes on our executive compensation and feedback received from shareholders during the summer of 2016 as well as ongoing outreach to shareholders since then, the Compensation Committee approved our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program with the following key components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A mix of long-term and short-term compensation components align executive interests with shareholders and serve  to attract, retain and motivate executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• More than 60% of the target total compensation (64% for our current CEO, 66% for our former CEO, 63% for COO and  63% for CFO) was variable and performance-based, and a substantial portion (79% for our current CEO, 75% for our former CEO, 60% for COO and 65% for CFO) was equity-based. Target total compensation consists of annual base salary, target bonus  opportunity under our cash-based incentive plan and the aggregate grant date fair value of time-based and performance-based equity award grants in fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We negotiated our current CEO's target total compensation when he joined us in September 2017 to be  significantly lower (on an annualized basis) than our former CEO's target total compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased the annual base salaries of our former CEO (by 6%), COO (by 6%) and CFO (by 8%).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Two-thirds of the equity awards granted to each of our named executive  officers in fiscal 2018 consisted of performance-based restricted share units (PSUs) with challenging two-year cumulative performance targets.  
[END TABLE]
-3- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We established challenging performance goals at the beginning of fiscal 2018 to determine payouts under our  cash-based incentive compensation plan following the completion of fiscal 2018. Because we did not achieve such pre-established performance goals, and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, no  bonuses were actually paid to our named executive officers under our fiscal 2018 cash-based incentive plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased the target amount (13% for our former CEO, 14% for COO and 11% for CFO) that could become payable to  each of our named executive officers under our fiscal 2018 cash-based incentive plan. However, no bonuses were actually paid to our named executive officers under our fiscal 2018 cash-based incentive plan based on actual achievements under the  rigorous plan metrics.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also continued its dialogue with shareholders on our executive compensation practices by soliciting the views of institutional investors representing approximately 48% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017, and having discussions in October 2017 with investors representing approximately 24% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017, including four of our ten then-largest shareholders. 
Fiscal 2019 Updates. In August 2018, the Compensation Committee approved our fiscal 2019 executive compensation program with the following key components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We continue to use a mix of long-term and short-term compensation components to align executive interests with  shareholders and attract, retain and motivate executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased the annual base salary of our current CEO (by 11%). No other executive officers received raises for  fiscal 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased the percentage of equity awards granted in fiscal 2019 that are performance-based from 67% in fiscal  2018 to 70% for our current CEO, 71% for our COO and 70% for our CFO in fiscal 2019. The performance-based equity awards continue to consist of PSUs with challenging two-year cumulative performance targets.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our cash-based incentive plan for fiscal 2019 continues to use annual revenue and  non-GAAP gross margin as the sole performance measures that will determine payouts, if any, following the completion of fiscal 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We increased the target amount that may become payable to our current CEO (by 15%) under our fiscal 2019  cash-based incentive plan. No other executive officers received increases in their target amounts.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee plans to continue its practice of shareholder outreach regarding our executive compensation practices by soliciting the views of institutional investors representing approximately 50% of our shares outstanding as of June 29, 2018, including our ten largest shareholders as of that date. The Compensation Committee expects to contact such shareholders between the filing of this proxy statement and the date of our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.

Q:  Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the  mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have  elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we began sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners on or about  October 19, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
All shareholders will be able to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice, or to request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy can be found in the Notice. In addition, shareholders may request the proxy materials be sent by mail or email on an ongoing basis. Choosing to receive future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you, and will reduce the impact of our annual meetings on the environment.

Q:  What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal One:     Election of two Class III directors listed in this proxy statement and recommended by the Board to serve for a term of three years,  or until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified;   
 Proposal One:     Election of two Class III directors listed in this proxy statement and recommended by the Board to serve for a term of three years,  or until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified;   
 Proposal Two:     Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal  year ending June 28, 2019; and   
 Proposal Three:    An advisory vote to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The Board recommends that you vote your shares:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" each of the nominees listed in this proxy statement and recommended by the Board for  election as Class III directors (Proposal One);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. as our independent  registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending June 28, 2019 (Proposal Two); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our named executive  officers (Proposal Three).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals and how are votes  counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A plurality of the votes cast is required for the election of directors (Proposal One). You may vote  "FOR" or "WITHHOLD" on each nominee for election as director. The nominees for director receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected as directors. Abstentions and broker  non-votes will not affect the outcome of the election. However, as set forth under "Corporate Governance—Majority Voting Policy in Uncontested Elections," we have a policy that if a director  receives more "Withhold" votes than "For" votes in an uncontested election such as this one, the director shall offer his or her resignation for consideration by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required to (1) ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending June 28, 2019 (Proposal Two), and (2) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers (Proposal Three). You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" on these proposals. Abstentions have the same effect as votes against these proposals. However, broker non-votes are not deemed to be votes cast and, therefore, are not included in the tabulation of voting results on these proposals. 
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly submitted proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting (and not revoked) will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated by such proxy. If no instructions are indicated on such proxy, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board.

A:  The presence of the holders of at least one-third of the total shares  entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Such shareholders are counted as present at the meeting if (1) they are present in person at the Annual Meeting or (2) have properly  submitted a proxy.  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. 
-6- 
A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, and the broker does not have, or declines to exercise, discretionary authority to vote those shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Shares held in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. Shares held  beneficially in street name may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the  Annual Meeting, we recommend you also submit your vote as described in the Notice and as described below, so your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Whether you hold shares directly as the shareholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct  how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by submitting a proxy; please refer to the voting instructions in the Notice or below. If you hold shares beneficially in street name,  you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee; please refer to the voting instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or nominee.  
[END TABLE]
By Internet—Shareholders of record with Internet access may submit proxies until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on December 12, 2018, by following the "Vote by Internet" instructions described in the Notice, or by following the instructions at www.proxyvote.com. Most Fabrinet shareholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may vote by accessing the website specified in the voting instructions provided by their brokers, trustees or nominees. If you are a beneficial owner, please check the voting instructions provided by your broker, trustee or nominee for information regarding Internet voting availability. 
By telephone—Depending on how your shares are held, you may be able to vote by telephone. If this option is available to you, you will have received information with the Notice or the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee explaining this procedure. 
By mail—Shareholders of record may request a paper proxy card from Fabrinet and indicate their vote by completing, signing and dating the card where indicated and by returning it in the prepaid envelope that will be included with the proxy card. Please follow the procedures outlined in the Notice to request a paper proxy card. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a  beneficial owner?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Shareholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,  Computershare Trust Company, you are considered the "shareholder of record" with respect to those shares, and we have sent the Notice directly to you. As a shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us  or to a third party, or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name," and the Notice is being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee (who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares). As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed or provided voting instructions for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, because you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your broker, bank or nominee giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. 
-7- 
If you hold your shares through a broker and do not provide your broker with specific voting instructions, your broker will have the discretion to vote your shares only on routine matters. As a result: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your broker will not have the authority to exercise discretion to vote your shares with respect to the election  of directors and the advisory vote to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers because the rules of The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") treat those matters as non-routine; but   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your broker will have the authority to exercise discretion to vote your shares with respect to the ratification  of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending June 28, 2019, because NYSE rules treat that matter as routine.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, including, among other  things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the Annual Meeting to another time or place (including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies), the persons named as proxy holders will have discretion to vote on those  matters in accordance with their best judgment. We do not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Subject to any rules your broker, bank or nominee may have, you may change your vote at any time before your  proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you are the shareholder of record, you may change your vote by (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the voting methods described above (and until the applicable deadline for each method), (2) providing a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, c/o Fabrinet USA, Inc., 4900 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054 prior to your shares being voted, or (3) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attending the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically request this. 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may change your vote by (1) submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee, or (2) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person if you first have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What happens if I decide to attend the Annual Meeting but I have already voted or  submitted a proxy card covering my shares?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Subject to any rules your broker, bank or nominee may have, you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in  person even if you have already voted or submitted a proxy card. Any previous votes that were submitted by you will be superseded by the vote you cast at the Annual Meeting. Please be aware that attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself,  revoke a proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If a broker, bank or nominee beneficially holds your shares in street name and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, you must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or nominee holding your shares that gives you the right to vote the shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you received more than one Notice, voting instruction card or set of proxy materials, your shares are  registered in more than one name or brokerage account. Please follow the instructions on each Notice or voting instruction card that you receive, to ensure that all of your shares are voted.  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a  manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within Fabrinet or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and  certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to Fabrinet's management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will also disclose voting results on a  Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting, which will also be available in the "Investors—Financials—SEC Filings" section of our website at  www.fabrinet.com.  
[END TABLE]

Q:  Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?

We may reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons representing beneficial owners for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such beneficial owners. Our directors,  officers and employees also may solicit proxies in person or by other means of communication. Such directors, officers and employees will not be additionally compensated, but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such solicitation.

PROPOSAL ONE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that the number of our directors will be fixed from time to time by the Board, but may not consist of more than 15 directors. The Board presently consists of six directors who are divided into three classes with overlapping three-year terms as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Class III Directors (Term Expires in  2018)     Class I Directors (Term Expires in 2019)     Class II Directors (Term Expires in  2020) 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  As disclosed in the proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, in order to make the classes  of directors as even as possible, the Board moved Dr. Levinson from Class II to Class III following his reelection as a Class II director at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
Upon expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for three-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders in the year in which that term expires. 
Nominees for Director 
Three candidates have been nominated for election at the Annual Meeting as Class III directors for a three-year term expiring in 2021. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, the Board nominated Dr. Frank H. Levinson and David T. Mitchell for election as Class III directors. Biographical information for each of the nominees is set forth below. 
Each nominee has consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serving as a director if elected, and we have no reason to believe any nominee will be unavailable to serve. In the event Dr. Levinson or Mr. Mitchell is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who may be proposed by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and designated by the Board to fill the vacancy. 
If you sign your proxy or voting instruction card or vote by telephone or over the Internet, but do not give instructions with respect to the election of directors, your shares will be voted for the three persons recommended by the Board. If you wish to give specific instructions with respect to the election of directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card, or when you vote by telephone or over the Internet. If you do not give voting instructions to your broker, your broker will not vote your shares on this matter.

The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. and its network firm ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending June 28, 2019.

Notwithstanding its selection, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of Fabrinet and its shareholders. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee may reconsider its selection.

PROPOSAL THREE 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION PAID TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
General 
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers (or "Named Officers") as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with rules of the SEC. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our Named Officers' compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific Named Officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our Named Officers and the compensation philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. We currently hold our say-on pay vote every year. 
While this advisory vote to approve executive compensation is non-binding, it will provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which the Compensation Committee will be able to consider when making future executive compensation decisions. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of shareholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the Named Officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, will endeavor to communicate with shareholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote, consider those shareholders' concerns and evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
We urge shareholders to read the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement, and in particular the information discussed under the heading "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis", which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives. We believe that our executive compensation program is working to ensure management's interests are aligned with our shareholders' interests to support long-term value creation. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, you are being asked to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that Fabrinet's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Fabrinet's named executive officers, as disclosed in Fabrinet's Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related narrative disclosures." 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation paid to our Named Officers. 
-18- 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, our internal accounting and financial controls, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the organization and performance of our internal audit function and the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls and preparing our consolidated financial statements. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the financial statements. It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to oversee these activities. 
The Audit Committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS  Ltd., our independent registered public accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. the matters required to be discussed under the rules adopted by  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. required by applicable  requirements of the PCAOB regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd.'s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers ABAS Ltd. its independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based upon these discussions and review, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2018, for filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Respectfully submitted by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that establish the corporate governance policies the Board intends to follow in overseeing our business in accordance with its fiduciary duties. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the "Investors—Governance" section of our website at www.fabrinet.com. 
Code of Business Conduct 
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct, with business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment. Accordingly, the Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct, which is applicable to all of our directors, officers (including our principal executive officer and senior financial and accounting officers) and employees. The Code of Business Conduct is available in the "Investors—Governance" section of our website at www.fabrinet.com. We will disclose on our website any amendments to the Code of Business Conduct, as well as any waivers, required to be disclosed by SEC or NYSE rules. 
Majority Voting Policy in Uncontested Elections 
The Board endorses the principle of using a majority voting standard for uncontested elections of directors. Accordingly, in an election of directors such as this one, a nominee who receives more "Withhold" votes than "For" votes is expected to promptly tender his or her resignation as a director to the Board for consideration. After considering any information the Board deems appropriate, the Board will act to accept or reject each tendered director resignation. Any director who tenders a resignation under the majority voting policy may not participate in the action of the Board regarding whether to accept or reject his or her tender of resignation. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will fill the chairman and chief executive officer positions based upon what it believes is in our best interests at any point in time. Mr. Mitchell served in both positions until his retirement as chief executive officer in September 2017. We separated the two roles effective upon this transition, with Mr. Mitchell continuing as executive chairman of the Board from September 2017 until June 2018, and as a non-employee chairman of the Board beginning in June 2018. The Board believes that as our founder and having served as our chief executive officer from our inception until September 2017, Mr. Mitchell is in the best position to direct the focus and attention of the Board on the areas most relevant for us and our shareholders, as Mr. Mitchell is the most familiar with our business, industry and strategic priorities. In the role of chairman, Mr. Mitchell also is able to provide strong and valuable leadership for us both internally and externally. 
In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the chairman is not independent, the Board shall appoint a lead independent director. Rollance Olson has served as our lead independent director since January 2011. The lead independent director's duties include coordinating the activities of the independent and other non-employee directors, coordinating the agenda for and moderating sessions of the independent and other non-employee directors, and facilitating communications among the entire Board. 
Our independent directors meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, and at such other times as necessary or appropriate as determined by the independent directors. Our lead independent director presides at such executive sessions of the Board. 
Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for the oversight of our enterprise risk management. Together with its committees, the Board ensures that any material risks relevant to us or our business are appropriately considered and 
-20- 
 addressed. Our management team is responsible for day-to-day risk management. Management's responsibilities include identifying, evaluating and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise, strategic, financial and operating levels and the development of processes for mitigating these risks, and the Board, together with its committees, oversees management in its execution of these responsibilities. At periodic meetings of the Board and its committees, and in other meetings and discussions, our management reports to and seeks guidance from the Board and its committees, as applicable, with respect to matters that could affect our business. In addition, our legal counsel provides reports of legal risks to the Board and its committees. Similarly, our chief financial officer provides reports to the Audit Committee concerning financial, tax and audit related risks. In addition, the Audit Committee receives periodic reports from management on our compliance programs and efforts, investment policy and practices. 
The Board reviews the strategic, financial and operational risks inherent in our business through its consideration of the various matters presented to the Board or its committees by management for review or approval. Furthermore, each board committee regularly reviews and evaluates various aspects of enterprise risk as part of its specific functions and responsibilities delegated by the Board. The Audit Committee considers risk in connection with its oversight of our financial review and reporting processes and regulatory and corporate compliance matters. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight and review of certain risk management policies, including our insurance, investment and business continuity policies. The Compensation Committee considers risk in connection with its oversight of the design and administration of our compensation policies, plans and programs. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considers risk in connection with its oversight of our governance structure, policies and processes, including conflicts of interest (other than related party transactions reviewed by the Audit Committee). 
We believe that the Board's role is consistent with our leadership structure, with our chief executive officer and management primarily responsible for enterprise risk management, and with the Board and its committees providing oversight of these efforts. 
Contacting the Board of Directors 
Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with our lead independent director by sending an email to leadindependentdirector@fabrinet.com. Communications received at this email address are automatically routed directly to our lead independent director. Shareholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board may do so by sending an email to board@fabrinet.com or a written communication addressed to Fabrinet, c/o Fabrinet USA, Inc., 4900 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attention: Board of Directors. Our legal counsel reviews all incoming communications from shareholders and other interested parties (except for communications sent directly to the lead independent director, mass mailings, product complaints or inquiries, job inquiries, business solicitations and patently offensive or otherwise inappropriate material) and, as appropriate, routes such communications to the appropriate member(s) of the Board, or if none is specified, to the executive chairman of the Board. 
Attendance at Annual Meetings of Shareholders by the Board of Directors 
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meeting of shareholders, we encourage, but do not require, directors to attend. All of our directors attended our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Director Independence 
Our ordinary shares are listed on the NYSE. Pursuant to the NYSE listing standards, independent directors must comprise a majority of the Board, and each member of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees must be independent. A director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of the Board, that director does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
-21- 
Audit Committee members also must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of the Audit Committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Audit Committee, the Board, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from us or any of our subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of us or any of our subsidiaries. 
Compensation Committee members must satisfy additional independence criteria set forth under the NYSE listing standards. In order for a member of the Compensation Committee to be considered independent, the Board must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to us that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including, but not limited to: (1) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee paid by us to such director; and (2) whether such director is affiliated with us, any of or subsidiaries, or an affiliate of any of our subsidiaries. 
The Board has reviewed the independence of each director and determined that Dr. Bahrami, Mr. Kelly, Dr. Levinson and Mr. Olson, representing four of our six directors, do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE listing standards. In making these determinations, the Board considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances the Board deemed relevant. 
Board Meetings and Committees 
During fiscal 2018, the Board held twelve meetings and also took certain actions by written consent. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during fiscal 2018. The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, each of which has the composition and responsibilities described below. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee currently consists of Mr. Kelly (chairman), Dr. Bahrami and Dr. Levinson, each of whom is independent under the NYSE listing standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Board has determined that Mr. Kelly qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules and regulations of the SEC and that each member of the Audit Committee meets the financial literacy requirements of the NYSE listing standards. The Audit Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Among other responsibilities, the Audit Committee (1) oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audit of our financial statements, (2) assists the Board in overseeing the integrity of our financial statements (including, without limitation, internal control over financial reporting), (3) oversees our compliance with ethics policies and legal and regulatory requirements, (4) oversees the performance of our independent auditors, (5) prepares the disclosure required by applicable law and SEC rules, and (6) provides to the Board such information and materials as it may deem necessary to make the Board aware of significant financial matters that require the attention of the Board.

The Audit Committee report is included in this proxy statement on page 19. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Dr. Levinson (chairman) and Mr. Kelly, each of whom is independent under the NYSE listing standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, the Board 
-22- 
 has determined that Dr. Levinson and Mr. Kelly meet the requirements of the non-employee director definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the outside director definition of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The Compensation Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2018 and also took certain actions by written consent. 
Among other responsibilities, the Compensation Committee (1) develops, reviews and approves our overall compensation policies and goals, including policies and forms of compensation provided to our directors and executive officers, (2) oversees the administration of our equity compensation and employee benefit plans and programs, and (3) produces an annual report on executive officer compensation for inclusion in our annual proxy statement. The Compensation Committee acts in accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available in the "Investors—Governance" section of our website at www.fabrinet.com. 
The Compensation Committee report is included in this proxy statement on page 39. 
Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of Dr. Bahrami (chairwoman) and Mr. Olson, each of whom is independent under the NYSE listing standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC.

The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee acts in accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available in the "Investors—Governance" section of our website at www.fabrinet.com. 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations of candidates for election to the Board submitted by shareholders of Fabrinet. For more information, see "Process for Recommending Candidates for Election to the Board of Directors" below. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
We have adopted share ownership guidelines for our directors and executive officers. For information regarding such guidelines, see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Share Ownership Guidelines." 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During fiscal 2018, Mr. Kelly and Dr. Levinson served as members of the Compensation Committee. None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has in the past served as an officer or employee of Fabrinet. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Board or Compensation Committee. 
Process for Recommending Candidates for Election to the Board of Directors 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other things, determining the criteria for membership to the Board, and recommending candidates for election to the Board. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations from shareholders for 
-23- 
 candidates to serve on the Board. There are no differences in the manner by which the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder or a member of the Board. 
Shareholder Recommendations and Nominees 
Shareholder recommendations for candidates to the Board must be directed in writing to our Corporate Secretary, c/o Fabrinet USA, Inc., 4900 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054, and must include (1) the candidate's name, age, business address and residence address, (2) the candidate's principal occupation or employment, (3) the class and number of shares that are held of record or beneficially owned by the candidate and any derivative positions held or beneficially held by the candidate, (4) whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of the candidate with respect to any of our securities, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of our shares), the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, or to manage the risk or benefit of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of the candidate, (5) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the nominating shareholder and each candidate and any other person or persons pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the nominating shareholder, (6) a written statement executed by the candidate acknowledging that as a director, the candidate will owe a fiduciary duty under Cayman Islands law with respect to Fabrinet and its shareholders, and (7) any other information relating to the candidate that would be required to be disclosed about such candidate if proxies were being solicited for the election of the candidate as a director, or that is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including, without limitation, the candidate's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected). 
Shareholder recommendations for candidates to the Board must also contain specified information about the shareholder proposing such nomination. For more information, please refer to our memorandum and articles of association, which may be obtained by writing to our Corporate Secretary, c/o Fabrinet USA, Inc., 4900 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054, or by accessing Fabrinet's filings on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
Director Qualifications 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate and recommend candidates for membership on the Board consistent with any criteria established by the committee. The consideration of any candidate for director will be based on the committee's assessment of the individual's background, experience, skills and abilities, and if such characteristics qualify the individual to fulfill the needs of the Board at that time. While the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications or a formal diversity policy for director candidates, the committee believes that candidates and nominees should reflect a board of directors that is predominately independent and that is comprised of directors who (1) are of high integrity, (2) have broad, business-related knowledge and experience, (3) have qualifications that will increase overall board effectiveness, (4) have diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and (5) meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial expertise with respect to Audit Committee members. 
Identification and Evaluation of Director Nominees 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. The committee assesses the appropriate size and composition of the Board, the needs of the Board and its committees and the qualifications of candidates in light of these needs. Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee through shareholders, management, current members of the Board or search firms. The evaluation of these candidates may be based solely upon information provided to the committee or may also include discussions with persons familiar with the candidate, an interview of the candidate or other actions the committee deems appropriate, including the use of third parties to review candidates.

Shareholder Engagement and Executive Compensation Program Updates Following 2015, 2016 and 2017 Say-on-Pay Votes 
While approximately 75% and 78% of the votes cast in the say on-pay advisory vote at our 2017 and 2016 annual meetings of shareholders, respectively, were voted in favor of our executive compensation as disclosed in our 2017 and 2016 proxy statements, at our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders only 28% of the votes cast in the say-on-pay advisory vote were voted in favor of our executive compensation as disclosed in our 2015 proxy statement. In response to the results of our 2015 say-on-pay advisory vote, the Compensation Committee contacted shareholders to understand better their priorities and concerns with respect to our executive pay practices, examined the reports and analyses issued by the principal proxy advisory services, conferred with representatives of Institutional Shareholder Services in the spring of 2016 to discuss our compensation practices, and engaged a proxy advisory firm to advise the Compensation Committee. 
Following the 2015 say-on-pay advisory vote, the Compensation Committee solicited the views of institutional investors representing approximately 49% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2016, and had discussions with and received feedback on our executive compensation practices from investors representing approximately 20% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2016, including four of our ten (and nine of our 20) then-largest shareholders, during the summer of 2016. The Compensation Committee continued its dialogue with shareholders on our executive compensation practices by soliciting the views of institutional investors representing approximately 48% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017, and having discussions in October 2017 with investors representing approximately 24% of our shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017, including four of our ten then-largest shareholders. 
In light of the significantly increased votes cast in the say-on-pay advisory vote at our 2017 and 2016 annual meetings of shareholders in favor of our executive compensation as disclosed in our 2017 and 2016 proxy statements, we generally maintained a similar overall design with respect to our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, with some changes as summarized under "Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions" below and in the remainder of this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
-26- 
The Compensation Committee plans to continue its practice of shareholder outreach regarding our executive compensation practices by soliciting the views of institutional investors representing approximately 50% of our shares outstanding as of June 29, 2018, including our ten largest shareholders as of that date. The Compensation Committee expects to contact such shareholders between the filing of this proxy statement and the date of our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions 
In light of the results of our recent say-on-pay votes and the subsequent feedback we received from shareholders, the Compensation Committee continued to enhance the link between executive pay and longer-term company performance when it approved our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, as summarized below.

Executive Compensation Program Objectives and Overview 
Our executive compensation programs are intended to achieve three fundamental objectives: (1) attract, retain and motivate qualified executives; (2) hold executives accountable for performance; and (3) align executives' interests with the interests of our shareholders. In structuring and designing our executive compensation programs, we are guided by the following basic philosophies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competition. We should provide competitive compensation opportunities with respect to our industry so we  can attract, retain and motivate qualified executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alignment with Shareholder Interests. A substantial portion of compensation should be contingent on our  performance for our shareholders, to align the interests of executives with the interests of our shareholders and to hold the executives accountable for our performance.  
[END TABLE]
As described in more detail below, the material elements of our executive compensation programs for our Named Officers include a base salary, short-term cash incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards. In addition, our Named Officers may participate in our 401(k) plan and employee benefit programs on substantially the same terms as our other employees. Our Named Officers also are entitled to certain perquisites and personal benefits and, in some cases, are entitled to severance benefits upon certain terminations of their employment with us. 
-29- 
We believe each element of our executive compensation program helps us to achieve one or more of our compensation objectives. Taken together, the compensation elements are intended to provide a total compensation package for each Named Officer that is competitive. The table below lists each material element of our executive compensation program and the compensation objective or objectives it is designed to achieve.

Role and Authority of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Dr. Levinson (chairman) and Mr. Kelly, each of whom is "independent" within the meaning of NYSE rules. In addition, the Board has determined that Dr. Levinson and Mr. Kelly meet the requirements of the non-employee director definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the outside director definition of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Dr. Levinson has served as chairman of the Compensation Committee since November 2011, and Mr. Kelly has served as a member of the Compensation Committee since December 2015. No Compensation Committee member is a former or current officer or employee of Fabrinet or any of its subsidiaries. The Compensation Committee meets at least quarterly, and members of the Compensation Committee serve at the discretion of the Board. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing our compensation policies and goals and administering our equity compensation plans and executive incentive plan, including approving target and actual bonuses under our executive incentive plan. Additionally, the Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the compensation of our chief executive officer and other Named Officers. The Compensation Committee's role is detailed in its charter, which is available in the "Investors—Governance" section of our website at www.fabrinet.com. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate its authority to grant awards under Fabrinet's incentive compensation or other equity-based plans, except with respect to awards to executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee has delegated limited, non-exclusive authority to a committee consisting of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (the "Equity Award Committee") to grant equity awards under our 2010 Plan with respect to consultants, new hires and promotions for employees below the level of vice president (and with respect to new hires, for employees who are not expected to shortly thereafter become a vice president or above). In any fiscal year, the Equity Award Committee may grant, in the aggregate, share options and share appreciation rights, restricted share units, restricted shares or other full-value awards covering no more than the number of shares that have been budgeted and approved by the Compensation Committee for such fiscal year. The Equity Award Committee did not take action during fiscal 2018, and the Compensation Committee did not approve a budget of equity awards for the Equity Award Committee for fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee has not delegated any of its authority with respect to any component of the compensation of our Named Officers. 
-30- 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to engage the services of outside consultants to assist it in making decisions regarding the establishment of our compensation programs and philosophy. The Compensation Committee also may obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), a national compensation consulting firm, to provide independent compensation consulting services. If requested by the Compensation Committee, a representative of Compensia attends meetings of the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee did not request Compensia to join any of its meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Although Fabrinet pays Compensia's fees, Compensia reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee retains the authority to hire or fire Compensia and any other consultant or advisor. Compensia does not provide any services to us other than the services provided to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia taking into account, among other things, the factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, and has concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the work that Compensia performs for the Compensation Committee. 
During fiscal 2018, Compensia provided the Compensation Committee with a blend of peer group proxy data and other market data, as discussed below, to assist the Compensation Committee in evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation and non-employee director compensation programs. Compensia also advised the Compensation Committee on general compensation trends in the industry among similarly situated companies. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee works with members of our management team, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. Typically, our management team assists the Compensation Committee in the execution of its responsibilities by providing information on corporate and individual performance and management's perspective and recommendations on compensation matters. 
Because our current CEO joined us after the Compensation Committee had approved fiscal 2018 executive compensation, he did not participate in any discussions regarding executive compensation matters, other than negotiations with us with respect to his own compensation as set forth in his offer letter. Historically and for fiscal 2018, our former CEO made recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation matters. At the request of the Compensation Committee, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer occasionally participate in meetings of the Compensation Committee, except with respect to decisions involving their own compensation. While the Compensation Committee solicits the recommendations and proposals of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with respect to executive compensation matters, these recommendations and proposals are only one factor in the Compensation Committee's decision-making process. 
Fiscal 2018 Peer Group and Other Market Data 
To assist the Compensation Committee in evaluating whether our executive compensation practices for fiscal 2018 were competitive and consistent with the Compensation Committee's executive compensation program objectives, Compensia provided the Committee with compensation data (the "Blended Market Data") consisting of an equal blend of (1) proxy statement data (where available) from our fiscal 2018 peer group, and (2) proprietary survey data from high-tech companies with annual revenues between $500 million and $1.5 billion. The Compensation Committee used the Blended Market Data to compare our Named Officers' base 
-31- 
 salary, target cash incentive opportunity, target total cash compensation, equity compensation and total direct compensation against the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the same categories of compensation for executives holding positions comparable (where possible) to the positions of our Named Officers. However, the Compensation Committee does not benchmark or apply specific formulas to determine adjustments to our Named Officers' base salary, target cash incentive opportunity, target total cash compensation, equity compensation or total direct compensation. 
The specific criteria for selection into our peer group are set annually by the Compensation Committee. When our peer group is reviewed each year, companies may be removed for failure to meet the selection criteria, or new companies may be added as necessary to ensure a significant sample size of companies. In selecting a peer group, the Compensation Committee considers companies that, in its view, compete with us for talent and have financial or other organizational metrics generally similar to ours. Accordingly, our peer group includes a blend of businesses classified as providing either optical electronic equipment or contract manufacturing services. The selection criteria for our fiscal 2018 peer group included 12-month trailing revenue, market capitalization, and headcount metrics. Our 12-month trailing revenue and market capitalization were in the 78th and 38th percentiles, respectively, of our fiscal 2018 peer group at the time the Compensation Committee selected the group. Compensia gathered data on the compensation practices of the companies in our fiscal 2018 peer group through publicly available information, where available. 
Our fiscal 2018 peer group, as approved by the Compensation Committee, was the same as our fiscal 2017 peer group, except for the removal of three companies (Multi-Fineline Electronix, Inc., Newport Corporation and Rofin Sinar Technologies, Inc.) that were acquired in 2016. Our fiscal 2018 peer group consisted of the following 19 companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Executive Compensation Program Elements 
Base Salaries 
We provide a base salary to our executive officers and other employees to compensate them for services rendered on a day-to-day basis. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee typically reviews and determines whether to adjust executive base salaries on the basis of each executive officer's level of responsibility, qualifications, experience, past performance and expected future contributions. The Compensation Committee also considers whether executive base salaries are competitive as compared to salary practices gathered from the Blended Market Data. 
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the salary component of the Blended Market Data provided by Compensia and considered each executive officer's past performance and expected future contributions, changes in each executive officer's responsibilities and organizational changes. As a result of its 
-32- 
 review, the Compensation Committee decided to increase the annual base salaries of certain Named Officers for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, as shown below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Officer    Fiscal 2017 Annual Base Salary    Fiscal 2018 Annual Base Salary% Change   
 Mr. Grady    N/A    $ 700,000        N/A   
 Mr. Mitchell    $900,000    $ 950,000        5.6%  
 Dr. Gill    $900,000    $ 950,000        5.6%  
 Mr. Ng    $600,000    $ 650,000        8.3%  
 Dr. Hou    $475,000    $ 525,000        10.5%  
[END TABLE]
In recognition of Dr. Hou's performance and in light of the fact that he had not received a raise since joining us in January 2016, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to increase Dr. Hou's salary by approximately 10.5% as compared to fiscal 2017. 
Short-Term Cash Incentive Awards 
In August 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a cash incentive plan for fiscal 2018 (the "Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan") that provided each of our Named Officers with the ability to receive cash incentive awards based (1) 50% on Fabrinet's achievement of a fiscal 2018 revenue target of $1.56 billion, and (2) 50% on Fabrinet's achievement of a fiscal 2018 non-GAAP gross margin target of 12.75%, with achievement of each financial target considered independently from the other. The Compensation Committee chose these performance goals because it believes that these goals constitute important, key performance metrics that significantly can impact our business success. For purposes of the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan, GAAP gross margin was adjusted for certain items. Non-GAAP gross margin excluded share-based compensation expenses and depreciation of fair value uplift. As discussed further below, none of our Named Officers received a bonus under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan because we did not achieve the plan's pre-established performance targets. 
Under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan, each Named Officer's target bonus was also the maximum bonus he could have received under the plan. Achievement of a target bonus payout would have required very high levels of corporate performance that the Compensation Committee believed were possible but unlikely to be achieved. By basing a substantial portion of our Named Officers' total cash compensation on achievement of financial goals designed to drive shareholder value, the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan was intended to align their interests with the interests of our shareholders. 
The Compensation Committee determined the target bonus opportunity for each Named Officer under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan by considering the Blended Market Data provided by Compensia, evaluated against other criteria, including the Named Officer's functional responsibilities and ongoing duties. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following target bonus opportunity amounts for our Named Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Target (and Maximum) Bonus  Opportunity 
 Named Officer     Fiscal 2017     Fiscal 2018% Change 
 Mr. Grady    N/A    $651,000*    N/A 
 Mr. Mitchell    $1,600,000 (178% of base salary)     $1,800,000 (189% of base salary)    12.5% 
 Mr. Mitchell    $1,600,000 (178% of base salary)     $1,800,000 (189% of base salary)    12.5% 
 Dr. Gill    $1,100,000 (122% of base salary)     $1,250,000 (132% of base salary)    13.6% 
 Mr. Ng    $750,000 (125% of base salary)     $835,000 (128% of base salary)    11.3% 
 Mr. Ng    $750,000 (125% of base salary)     $835,000 (128% of base salary)    11.3% 
 Dr. Hou    $400,000 (84% of base salary)     $437,500 (83% of base salary)    9.4% 
[END TABLE]
-33- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Mr. Grady's target (and maximum) bonus opportunity was prorated to reflect 120% of his base salary  earned during fiscal 2018. If Mr. Grady had served as our CEO for all of fiscal 2018, his target (and maximum) bonus opportunity would have been $840,000.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan, if we had achieved 100% or more of a target financial metric, bonuses would have been payable to our Named Officers at 100% of target with respect to that financial metric component. If our fiscal 2018 revenue was less than or equal to $1.42 billion (i.e., approximately 91.0% of the fiscal 2018 revenue target) or if our fiscal non-GAAP gross margin was less than or equal to 12.0% (i.e., approximately 94.1% of the fiscal 2018 non-GAAP gross margin target), no bonuses would be paid out with respect to the applicable financial metric component. Achievement of fiscal 2018 revenue between $1.42 billion and $1.56 billion would have resulted in a bonus amount for that metric that was scaled from 0 to 100% in a linear fashion. Achievement of fiscal 2018 non-GAAP gross margin between 12.0% and 12.75% would have resulted in a bonus amount for that metric that was scaled from 0 to 100% in a linear fashion. 
For fiscal 2018, we achieved (1) revenue of $1.37 billion, or approximately 87.8% of our fiscal 2018 revenue target, resulting in no bonus being funded with respect to that component, and (2) non-GAAP gross margin of 11.8%, or approximately 92.5% of our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP gross margin target, resulting in no bonus being funded with respect to that component. Accordingly, in August 2018, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy and commitment to pay for performance, the Compensation Committee determined that no bonuses would be awarded to our Named Officers under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan. 
The following table describes the target, maximum and actual bonus amounts for each of our Named Officers under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan.

*  Mr. Grady's target (and maximum) bonus opportunity was prorated to reflect 120% of his base salary  earned during fiscal 2018. If Mr. Grady had served as our CEO for all of fiscal 2018, his target (and maximum) bonus opportunity would have been $840,000.

Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
Our equity incentive plans are a critical component of the compensation program that we believe incentivizes our executive officers and key employees to focus on building shareholder value through meeting long-term financial and strategic goals. We grant restricted share units ("RSUs") to our executive officers and other employees under our 2010 Plan. We also adopted our 2017 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan in November 2017 solely for the granting of inducement share options and other equity awards to new employees. RSUs function as a retention incentive for our executives as they generally vest annually over a three or four-year period after the date of grant, subject to the executive's continued service with us. 
In furtherance of our commitment to the executive compensation program's philosophy to pay for performance and to help align more closely the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders, beginning in fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee adopted a practice of granting PSUs to our Named 
-34- 
 Officers that will be earned, if at all, following a cumulative 2-year performance period. The Compensation Committee continued this practice in fiscal 2018 by granting PSUs to our Named Officers that will be earned, if at all, following a cumulative 2-year performance period covering fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. Any earned PSUs will vest in full on the date the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance criteria described below. The Compensation Committee also granted time-based RSUs to our Named Officers in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, equity award grants to our Named Officers were weighted heavily toward performance, with a mix of 67% PSUs and 33% RSUs. The Compensation Committee believes that this mix of performance-based awards and service-based awards was appropriate to emphasize and more closely align pay with the achievement of important, key performance metrics that significantly can impact our business success. 
The Compensation Committee bases long-term equity incentive award grants to executives on a number of factors, including the Blended Market Data provided by Compensia, the executive's vested and unvested equity holdings, the executive's position and total compensation package, and the executive's contribution to the success of our financial performance. 
In August 2017 and November 2017 (in the case of Mr. Grady only), the Compensation Committee granted the following dollar value of RSUs, PSUs and "stretch" PSUs to our Named Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Officer    Grant Date Value of RSUs      Grant Date Value of PSUs      Grant Date Value of "Stretch" PSUs   
 Mr. Grady    $ 1,499,972      $ 1,499,972      $ 1,499,972   
 Mr. Mitchell    $ 2,749,975      $ 2,749,975      $ 2,749,975   
 Dr. Gill    $ 1,099,990      $ 1,099,990      $ 1,099,990   
 Mr. Ng    $ 934,995      $ 934,995      $ 934,995   
 Dr. Hou    $ 549,995      $ 549,995      $ 549,995   
[END TABLE]
Mr. Grady's RSUs will vest in equal annual installments over a period of four years on each of September 22, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to continued service with us through each such vesting date. Mr. Mitchell's, Dr. Gill's and Mr. Ng's RSUs will vest in equal annual installments over a period of three years on each of August 24, 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to the individual's continued service with us through each such vesting date. Dr. Hou forfeited two-thirds of the RSUs and all of the PSUs granted to him in August 2017 when he terminated his employment with us on August 25, 2018. 
The PSUs will vest, if at all, following a 2-year performance period, on the date the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance criteria set forth below, subject to the individual's continued service with us through such vesting date. Vesting of the PSUs will be based 50% on achievement of a cumulative fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 revenue target (the "PSU Revenue Target") and 50% on achievement of a cumulative fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 non-GAAP gross margin target (the "PSU GM Target"). The Compensation Committee chose these performance goals as it believes that these constitute important, key performance metrics that significantly can impact our business success. As achievement of each financial target is considered independently from the other, we must meet a threshold for each factor in order for an individual to receive any credit for that factor. If we achieve 100% or more of a target financial metric, the PSUs will vest at 100% of target with respect to that financial metric component. Achievement of the PSU Revenue Target at a level between approximately 93.9% and 100% will result in a number of shares vesting for that metric that is scaled from 0% to 100% in a linear fashion. Achievement of the PSU GM Target at a level between approximately 98.0% and 100% will result in a number of shares vesting for that metric that is scaled from 0% to 100% in a linear fashion. 
The "stretch" PSUs will vest, if at all, following a 2-year performance period, on the date the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance criteria set forth below, subject to the individual's continued service with us through such vesting date. Vesting of the "stretch" PSUs will be based 50% on achievement of a cumulative fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 revenue target that is higher than the PSU Revenue Target (the "Stretch 
-35- 
 PSU Revenue Target") and 50% on achievement of a cumulative fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 non-GAAP gross margin target that is higher than the PSU GM Target (the "Stretch PSU GM Target"). As achievement of each financial target is considered independently from the other, we must meet a threshold for each factor in order for an individual to receive any credit for that factor. If we achieve 100% or more of a target financial metric, the Stretch PSUs will vest at 100% of target with respect to that financial metric component. Achievement of the Stretch PSU Revenue Target at a level between the PSU Revenue Target and 100% will result in a number of shares vesting for that metric that is scaled from 0% to 100% in a linear fashion. Achievement of the Stretch PSU GM Target at a level between the PSU GM Target and 100% will result in a number of shares vesting for that metric that is scaled from 0% to 100% in a linear fashion.

[END TABLE]
Perquisites and Personal Benefits 
In addition to base salaries, we provide our Named Officers with certain perquisites and personal benefits. We believe that perquisites and personal benefits are a tax-advantaged way to provide our Named Officers with additional annual compensation that supplements their base salaries. We do not establish the value of each Named Officer's perquisites and personal benefits in a vacuum or as some form of compensation "add on." Instead, we view the value of the perquisites as another component of annual compensation that is merely paid in a different form. When determining each Named Officer's base salary, we take the value of each Named Officer's perquisites and personal benefits into consideration. 
We provide certain benefits and allowances to our international assignees, including our Named Officers, which include housing and transportation allowances, living and travel expense reimbursements and tax preparation services. Consistent with the policy we have adopted with respect to all U.S. citizens who are working on our behalf in Asia on an expatriate basis, we pay such employees a tax equalization payment that is intended to put the employee in the same position, from a tax-liability perspective, that he or she would be in if they were still located in the United States. Of our Named Officers, Mr. Mitchell, Dr. Gill and Mr. Ng received a tax equalization payment in fiscal 2018 because each qualified for such benefit under the policy. 
-37- 
In addition, in October 2014, the Compensation Committee approved the payment of additional cash compensation to Dr. Gill and Mr. Ng in the amount of 20% of their respective then-current annual base salary, determined and payable bi-monthly, with a tax gross-up (the "Foreign Service Premium Pay"), to incentivize them to continue working for us in Thailand and to ameliorate the resulting hardships to their families who are located in the United States. The Foreign Service Premium Pay was deemed effective as of July 1, 2014, and will continue for as long as Dr. Gill and Mr. Ng are required to, and do, temporarily reside and work in Thailand. In January 2015, the Compensation Committee authorized the purchase of key man life insurance policies for each of Dr. Gill and Mr. Ng, which provide for $3 million payable to the applicable Named Officer's elected beneficiaries and $2 million payable to us. Dr. Gill and Mr. Ng also receive a family travel benefit that provides each of their immediate family members a round-trip airline ticket to visit Thailand once per year at our expense. 
In October 2016, we reviewed executive perquisites and adopted a perquisite policy that excludes non-business, travel-related expenses and charitable contributions. 
The perquisites and personal benefits paid to each Named Officer are reported in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table below, and are further described in the footnotes to such table. 
Severance and Other Benefits Upon Termination of Employment 
We and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with our Named Officers that provide for them to receive severance benefits following certain terminations of their employment with us or our subsidiaries, as applicable. These arrangements are consistent with our overall compensation objectives because we believe such arrangements are critical to achieve our business objective of management retention. We evaluate the level of severance benefits to provide a Named Officer on a case-by-case basis. To ensure that the severance and change of control arrangements continue to remain consistent with our compensation philosophy and current market practices, the Compensation Committee may periodically review these arrangements. Please see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below, for a description of the severance benefits our Named Officers may be entitled to receive upon termination of their employment. 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
To further align the interests of our executive officers and members of the Board with those of our shareholders, we have adopted share ownership guidelines for our executive officers and directors, which provide for a minimum ownership level equal to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• chief executive officer—6x annual base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other executive officers—2x annual base salary; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• directors—3x annual Board retainer.  
[END TABLE]
Executive officers and directors are expected to have met these ownership levels by August 2017 or, if appointed or elected after August 2012, within five years of their appointment as an executive officer or election to the Board. Shares counted towards the minimum ownership levels include all shares beneficially owned by the executive officer or director and any unvested restricted share units held by the executive officer or director. Except for Mr. Grady, who joined us in September 2017 and has until September 2022 to meet the guidelines, all of our current executive officers and directors currently exceed their respective share ownership guidelines. 
Hedging Policy 
We have an insider trading policy that prohibits, among other things, short sales, hedging of stock ownership positions, and transactions involving derivative securities relating to our ordinary shares. 
-38- 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally places a limit of $1 million per year on the U.S. corporate income tax deduction a publicly-held corporation may take for compensation paid to each of its "covered employees" (generally, the chief executive officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers, other than the chief financial officer, as of the end of any fiscal year). In general, certain performance-based compensation approved by shareholders is not subject to this $1 million deduction limit. In fiscal 2018, we did not structure any of our compensation for our executive officers to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). In order to maintain an executive compensation program that continues to strive to achieve the incentive, retention, pay for performance, and other objectives of the program, the Compensation Committee may provide compensation to our Named Officers that may not be deductible to the extent that the aggregate amount exceeds $1 million. However, the Compensation Committee intends to maintain an approach to executive compensation that strongly links pay to performance. 
Compensation Recovery Policy 
We maintain a claw back policy that applies to our executive officers. If a majority of the independent members of the Board determines that an officer's misconduct caused us to materially restate all or a portion of our financial statements, the Board may require the officer to repay incentive compensation that would not have been payable absent the material restatement. This policy applies to all incentive compensation, excluding equity awards granted prior to the adoption of the policy, based on financial statements filed during the three years prior to the material restatement. The Compensation Committee intends to revisit our claw back policy after the SEC adopts final rules implementing the requirements of Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
Compensation and Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee has assessed the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices for all employees and, based on its assessment, does not believe that such compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee oversees Fabrinet's compensation policies, plans and benefit programs. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. 
Respectfully submitted by the members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

(2)  For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the amounts in this column also include the value at the grant date of  performance-based RSUs (PSUs) granted in such fiscal year based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions for such awards, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined  as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures.  
[END TABLE]
On August 24, 2017, the Compensation Committee granted PSUs to each of our Named Officers (other than Mr. Grady, who was granted PSUs on November 9, 2017). The PSUs will vest, if at all, following a 2-year cumulative performance period covering fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. As of the applicable dates of grant, consistent with the estimate determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718, the probable outcome of the performance conditions for these grants was 100% achievement. Accordingly, the fair value 
-40- 
 reported for the PSUs granted in fiscal 2018 assumes that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved and the grants will vest at their maximum level of 100%, as shown below:

(1)  Amounts reported represent the potential threshold, target and maximum cash incentive award amounts depending  on the level of performance achieved under our fiscal 2018 executive incentive plan, as described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Program Elements—Short-Term Cash Incentive Awards." Such amounts  ranged from 0% of the target payout, representing the lowest payout that would have been awarded upon achievement of a certain level of performance against one of the related financial goals, to 100% of the target payout, which also represents the  maximum payout possible under the fiscal 2018 executive incentive plan. In August 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that we had not achieved the pre-established performance targets under the Fiscal  2018 Bonus Plan. Accordingly, no cash bonuses were paid

(2)  Amounts reported represent the potential target and maximum number of performance-based RSUs (PSUs) the Named  Officer could earn pursuant to his PSU award based on achievement of two-year corporate performance objectives covering fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. There is no threshold payout amount under the PSUs, as the  minimum amount that may vest under each PSU award is 0 shares.  
(3)  Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of each equity award computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic  718. Amounts reported for PSUs are based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC  Topic 718, excluding the effects of estimated forfeitures. As of the date of grant, the probable outcome of the performance conditions for these grants was 100% achievement. The reported amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that  may be recognized by the Named Officer.  
(4)  Mr. Grady's target bonus under the Fiscal 2018 Bonus Plan was prorated to reflect 120% of his base  salary earned during fiscal 2018. If Mr. Grady had served as our CEO for all of fiscal 2018, his target (and maximum) bonus would have been $840,000.

Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio 
The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our current CEO's annual total compensation in fiscal 2018 to that of the median of all other employees for that same period. Our current CEO's total fiscal 2018 compensation would have been approximately $5,248,931 on an annualized basis as if our current CEO had been employed by us for all of fiscal 2018, and our median employee's total fiscal 2018 compensation was $8,009, making our current CEO's pay in fiscal 2018 approximately 655 times the pay of our median employee, who is a worker in Thailand. 
-49- 
The pay ratio described above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K ("Item 402(u)"). The median employee was identified by determining the compensation for each employee using the following consistently applied compensation measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary received in fiscal 2018 (annualized if employee worked only a portion of the fiscal year, including if  employee was on an unpaid leave of absence during the fiscal year);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual incentive bonus earned in fiscal 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• grant date fair value of equity awards granted during fiscal 2018; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perquisites paid in fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our calculation includes all employees in the United States, China, Thailand and the United Kingdom as of June 29, 2018. As of June 29, 2018, we had 262 employees located in the United States and 10,283 employees located outside of the United States. Our employees located in the Cayman Islands, an aggregate total of two employees, which is less than 5% of the total number of employees, were excluded from the calculation under the de minimis exception provided for in Item 402(u). We applied exchange rates as of June 29, 2018 to the compensation elements paid in Chinese Renminbi, Thai baht and British pounds.
