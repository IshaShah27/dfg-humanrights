The Board engaged an independent, third-party executive and corporate governance consultant to facilitate the 2018 annual self-evaluation exercises by the Board and its committees, which provided the Board with independent insight as to the effectiveness of its operation, the effectiveness of operations of its committees, its governance practices and its director succession planning. 
The Board appointed Kenneth M. Hartwick as independent Chairman of the Board ("Chairman") effective April 1, 2018. 
Effective July 27, 2018, the Board appointed Jennifer E. Lowry as a director. Ms. Lowry was appointed as a Class I director with an initial term expiring at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Ms. Lowry serves on the Board's Audit Committee. 
In 2018, the Board amended the guidelines that provide a framework for MYR Group's corporate governance (the "Corporate Governance Principles") to establish the general policy that directors will not be nominated for reelection or reappointment to the Board after reaching the age of 72. Additionally, directors are expected to tender their resignations immediately following the first annual stockholders' meeting following their 72nd birthday. The Board retains its discretion to waive this policy in individual cases. 
All but one of our directors are independent and four independent directors have been appointed since 2015.

PROPOSAL 2. ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (full proposal begins on page 59) 
The Board and the Compensation Committee seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve our named executive officer ("NEO") compensation as described under the sections entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Executive Compensation Tables." The Board values stockholders' opinions, and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the advisory vote when evaluating future executive compensation decisions. 
2018 Performance 
Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.531 billion compared to $1.403 billion and $1.142 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net income attributable to MYR Group Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $31.1 million compared to $21.2 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our backlog was $1.147 billion compared to $679.1 million and $688.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
On July 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Huen Electric, Inc., an electrical contracting firm based in Illinois, Huen Electric New Jersey Inc., an electrical contracting firm based in New Jersey, and Huen New York, Inc., an electrical contracting firm based in New York (collectively, the "Huen Companies"). The Huen Companies provide a wide range of commercial and industrial electrical construction capabilities under the Company's commercial and industrial ("C&I") segment and expand our C&I footprint into Illinois, New Jersey and New York. 
Executive Compensation Highlights 
Compensation decisions are based on a number of factors, including peer company data and general market data, Company performance against pre-established goals, relative performance of the Company's stock compared to a peer group, and the experience and contributions of individual executives. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our stockholders voted on an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our NEOs (the "Say-on-Pay" proposal), which was approved by more than 98% of the votes cast. Our executive compensation program seeks to attract and retain executive talent and emphasizes pay for performance. Our executive compensation program includes base salary, short-term incentive compensation under our Senior Management Incentive Plan (amended and restated as of May 1, 2014) (the "SMIP"), long-term equity compensation under our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP"), a defined-contribution retirement plan, and very limited perquisites.

PROPOSAL 3. RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (full proposal begins on page 64) 
The Board and the Audit Committee believe that the appointment of Crowe LLP ("Crowe") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
OTHER MATTERS THAT MAY BE PRESENTED AT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING (found on page 65) 
We will also act upon any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements of that meeting. The Board or proxy holders will use their discretion on other matters that may arise at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code of Ethics") applicable to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Code of Ethics promotes honest and ethical conduct, full and accurate public communication and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. We disclose any waiver or amendments to the Code of Ethics as required by the applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
Additionally, our Corporate Governance Principles provide a framework for MYR Group's corporate governance and assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities to help ensure compliance with governing law and our policies. 
Stockholders and others can access our corporate governance materials, including our Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"), committee charters, Corporate Governance Principles, Code of Ethics and other corporate governance related materials on our website at www.myrgroup.com. Copies of these materials are also available free of charge to any stockholder who sends a written request to our Secretary at MYR Group Inc., 1701 Golf Road, Suite 3-1012, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008. 
The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Proxy Statement or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC. 
Our Corporate Governance Principles require that at least a majority of the Board qualify as independent directors under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("Nasdaq") and any other requirements of the committees upon which he or she serves. Nasdaq listing standards have both objective tests and a subjective test for determining who is an independent director. The objective tests state, for example, that a director who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by the Company, is not considered independent. The subjective test requires the Board to affirmatively determine that the director does not have a relationship that would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. Members of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, respectively, are subject to certain additional qualification requirements as described below under "Audit Committee Matters" and "Compensation Committee Matters." 
After considering the Nasdaq listing standards and information provided by each director, the Board determined that the following directors are independent: Larry F. Altenbaumer, Bradley T. Favreau, Henry W. Fayne, Kenneth M. Hartwick, Gary R. Johnson, Jennifer E. Lowry, Donald C.I. Lucky, Maurice E. Moore and William D. Patterson. William A. Koertner is not considered an independent director due to his prior employment with MYR Group, which ended on March 31, 2018, and he will not be considered independent until March 31, 2021 in accordance with the Nasdaq listing standards. 
In accordance with the Corporate Governance Principles, the independent directors meet at least twice per year in executive sessions. Executive sessions are typically held following Board meetings, without management present. 
The Board values and encourages constructive dialogue with stockholders and other interested parties on compensation and other important governance topics. Stockholders and other interested parties can communicate with the directors, individually or as a group, by writing to our Secretary at MYR Group Inc., 1701 Golf Road, Suite 3-1012, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008 or by completing and submitting the "Contact Us" form on our corporate website at www.myrgroup.com under the "Investors" section. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Secretary forwards communications relating to matters within the Board's purview to the appropriate directors, communications relating to matters within a Board committee's area of responsibility to the chair of the appropriate committee and communications relating to ordinary business matters to the appropriate Company officer. The Secretary generally does not forward complaints about service, new services suggestions, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, surveys, business solicitations, advertisements or inappropriate communications. Anyone who has a concern about the Company's conduct, accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, or auditing matters may submit that concern anonymously or confidentially to the Company's Anonymous Incident Reporting System, MySafeWorkplace, at 800-461-9330 or www.mysafeworkplace.com. 
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that the Board has the discretion to choose its board leadership structure as it deems best for MYR Group and our stockholders. When determining the leadership structure that allows the Board to effectively carry out its responsibilities and represent our stockholders' interests, the Board considers various factors, including our specific business needs, our industry's demands, our operating and financial performance, the economic and regulatory environment, the Board's self-evaluations, alternative leadership structures and our corporate governance policies and practices. 
Effective April 1, 2018, William A. Koertner stepped down from his position as Executive Chairman of the Board and the Board appointed Kenneth M. Hartwick, one of the Company's independent directors, as Chairman. The Board believes that separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") positions provides strong leadership for our Company. By separating these positions, our CEO is able to focus on managing the Company's daily operations and our Chairman can devote his time and attention to matters of Board oversight and governance. 
The Corporate Governance Principles require an independent director to serve as lead director if the Chairman is not an independent director. As the Chairman is currently an independent director, Gary R. Johnson stepped down as lead independent director and continues to serve as a member of the Board. 
Except for Mr. Koertner, who due to his prior employment with the Company is not considered independent, the Board is composed entirely of independent directors. In addition, all of the committee members are independent and our Chairman is independent. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board periodically review and consider this leadership structure to ensure it remains appropriate for MYR Group. 
The Board has the necessary power and authority to request and obtain information directly from management, to retain outside consultants and to consult directly with management and employees where it deems appropriate. The Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint, compensate, retain and oversee the Company's independent registered public accountants. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to engage, retain, oversee and terminate compensation advisers for our senior management compensation review and for our directors' compensation review. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate search firms used to identify director candidates. 
We do not view risk in isolation but consider risk as part of our regular consideration of business strategy and business decisions. Assessing and managing risk is the responsibility of management, which establishes and maintains risk management processes, including action plans and controls, to balance risk mitigation and opportunities to create stockholder value. It is management's responsibility to anticipate, identify and communicate risks to the Board and/or its committees. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board has the responsibility to oversee and review certain aspects of our risk management efforts, either directly or through its committees, based upon management's identification, assessment and mitigation of risk. We approach risk management by integrating strategic planning and operational decision-making with risk oversight by management and the Board. The Board commits extensive time and effort discussing and establishing the Company's strategic plan, and it reconsiders key elements of the strategic plan as significant events and opportunities arise during the year. As part of the strategic plan review, the Board and management focus on the primary value drivers for the Company and risks facing the Company, as well as the Company's sustainability and social responsibilities. 
The Board's committees are each chaired by an independent director and support the Board's oversight functions by regularly addressing various risks in their respective areas of oversight. Specifically, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities in the areas of financial reporting, internal controls (including internal controls over information technology systems and security), compliance with public reporting requirements and cyber security. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities associated with risks arising from compensation policies and programs, including the review of incentive compensation to ensure our programs contribute to our success, increase stockholder value and discourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities associated with risks primarily related to corporate governance, director succession and the composition of the Board. Each of the committee chairs reports to the full Board at regular meetings concerning the activities of the committee, the significant issues it has discussed, and the actions taken by the committee. 
We believe that our leadership structure supports the risk oversight function of the Board. 
Each year, the Board and each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conduct a self-evaluation addressing matters that the Board and committees consider relevant to their performance. These evaluations include an assessment by each director of the performance of the Board and the committee or committees on which the director sits. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the evaluation process. 
In 2018, the Board engaged an independent, third-party executive and corporate governance consultant to facilitate the annual self-evaluation exercises by the Board and its committees. These self-evaluation exercises provided the Board with independent insight as to the effectiveness of its operation, the effectiveness of operations of its committees, its governance practices and its director succession planning. 
The Board has in the past, and may in the future, retain an independent, third-party executive and corporate governance consultant to facilitate Board and committee self-evaluations and individual director performance evaluations. 
Our Board designates the members and chairs of committees based on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendations. The Board has three standing committees — Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance — each composed entirely of independent directors. Mr. Koertner does not serve on any of the committees because, due to his prior employment with the Company, he is not considered an independent director under the Nasdaq listing standards. 
Each of the three standing committees has a written charter adopted by the Board. The charters define each committee's roles and responsibilities. The charters are available on our website at www.myrgroup.com under the "Investors" section. MYR Group will provide copies of these charters free of charge to any stockholder who sends a written request to our Secretary at MYR Group Inc., 1701 Golf Road, Suite 3-1012, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
We expect directors to regularly attend Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which they serve. In 2018, the Board held 11 meetings, the Audit Committee held 4 meetings, the Compensation Committee held 5 meetings, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held 4 meetings. Each of our directors serving during the year ended December 31, 2018 attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and committees on which they served. The overall aggregate director attendance for all Board and committee meetings was over 98%. All directors serving at the time of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting"), including the director nominees, attended that meeting and all directors are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Current membership of the standing committees is as follows: 
In 2018, the Board amended its Corporate Governance Principles in order to establish the general policy that directors will not be nominated for reelection or reappointment to the Board after reaching the age of 72. Directors are expected to tender their resignations immediately following the first annual meeting of stockholders following their 72nd birthday. The Board retains its discretion to waive this policy in individual cases. Accordingly, directors Henry W. Fayne and Gary R. Johnson are expected to tender their resignations following the 2019 Annual Meeting and the Board will consider accepting their resignations at that time. Should the Board accept one or both of their resignations, it is expected that the Board will act, in accordance with our By-Laws, to reduce the size of the Board to nine members or to eight members, respectively. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board has determined that all of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members are independent under the Nasdaq listing standards. The primary responsibilities of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include, among others:
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, screening, and recommending candidates to the Board for Board membership in accordance with the committee's charter, our Certificate of Incorporation, our By-Laws, our Corporate Governance Principles and additional criteria that may be considered regarding director candidate qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also evaluates the qualifications of all candidates properly nominated by stockholders using the same criteria. 
Since the identification and selection of qualified directors is a complex and subjective process that requires consideration of many intangible factors, and is significantly influenced by the particular needs of the Board from time to time, there is not a specific set of qualifications, qualities or skills that are necessary for a nominee to possess, other than those that are necessary to meet legal requirements, the Nasdaq listing standards and the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, Corporate Governance Principles and charters of the Board's committees. When considering nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may take into consideration many factors including, but not limited to, a candidate's:
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
When considering nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider whether the candidate possesses the qualifications, experience, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, it considers appropriate in the context of the Board's overall composition and needs. 
The Board is responsible for nominating directors for election to the Board. When considering whether our directors, including the nominees, have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to serve on the Board, the Board considers the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendations and the individual's breadth of knowledge of our industry and customers, integrity, particular experiences, talents, business judgment, vision, leadership skills and what each individual would bring to the Board as a whole, including the information discussed in each of the director's individual biographies. Additionally, the Board considers and values a director's or director nominee's extensive experience as a business leader and strong understanding of business operations in general. 
Under the heading "Proposal 1. Election of Directors," we provide an overview of each nominee's principal occupation, business experience and other directorships of publicly traded companies, together with the qualifications, experience, key attributes and skills that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe will best serve the interests of the Board, the Company and our stockholders. 
Our Corporate Governance Principles specify that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should consider the value of diversity on the Board in the director nominee identification and nomination process. While the Company does not have a specific policy regarding diversity, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending measures to be taken so that the Board reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's evaluation of director nominees and the Board as a whole includes the diversity of personal and professional experiences, opinions, perspectives, backgrounds, genders, ages and ethnicities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that a diverse board strengthens Board performance and better positions the Board to make thoughtful decisions. Accordingly, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to select nominees with complementary and diverse skills, backgrounds and experiences. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will assess the effectiveness of this approach as part of its review of the Board's composition as well as in the course of the Board's and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's self-evaluation process. 
In 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended, and the Board appointed, Jennifer E. Lowry as a director, continuing the diversification and strengthening of our Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the size and composition of the Board, which includes identifying measures to be taken so that the Board reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise and diversity, and recommends opportunities for adding diversity to the Board. While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee performs the initial review of the succession plans and makes recommendations to the Board as necessary, the entire Board has the primary responsibility for Board and committee succession planning and has developed both long-term and contingency plans. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board currently consists of ten directors. The directors are divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class II and Class III. The term for each class expires at the conclusion of a three-year period. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Class III directors are standing for election. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the nominations of Larry F. Altenbaumer, Bradley T. Favreau, William A. Koertner and William D. Patterson, each for a term ending at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until his successor has been chosen and qualified. 
Each of the nominees was chosen by the Board to be a director because the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that his qualifications, experience, background and skills, taken together, demonstrate his capacity to make a continuing meaningful contribution to the Board's oversight of the business and affairs of the Company. Accordingly, the Board believes that the continued service of each of the nominees on the Board will serve the best interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. 
If any nominee should be unavailable to serve due to an unanticipated event, the Board may designate another person as a substitute nominee or, in accordance with our By-Laws, act to reduce the number of directors. If the Board substitutes another nominee, the shares represented by your proxy card will be voted for the substitute nominee. None of the nominees are related to one another or to any other director or executive officer of MYR Group or its subsidiaries by blood, marriage or adoption. 
Our By-Laws provide that a director nominee in an uncontested election will be elected if the number of shares voted FOR the director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast on the issue of that director's election (including votes FOR, votes AGAINST and votes to withhold authority with respect to that director's election, but excluding any votes to ABSTAIN or broker non-votes). If a director in an uncontested election fails to receive the required number of votes for re-election in an uncontested election, the director is expected to tender his or her resignation for prompt consideration by the Board. A director whose resignation is under consideration is expected to abstain from participating in any decision regarding that resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept or reject a director's resignation. 
In a contested election, where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, a plurality vote standard will apply, and the director nominees who receive the most FOR votes will be elected. 
In this election, because the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting will not be a contested election. As a result, each of the nominees will be elected if the number of shares voted for such nominee's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast on the issue of such nominee's election (including votes FOR, votes AGAINST and votes to withhold authority with respect to that director's election, but excluding any votes to ABSTAIN or broker non-votes). 
If you return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted FOR the election of the nominees.

We use a combination of cash and equity-based compensation to attract and retain directors and to compensate directors for their service on the Board in amounts that are commensurate with their Board and committee responsibilities. The Compensation Committee reviews director compensation periodically and recommends changes to the Board when it deems them appropriate. The Compensation Committee and the Board consider analyses prepared by the Compensation Committee's independent executive and director compensation consultant, Mercer, of reported director compensation practices at our peer companies. The Compensation Committee generally seeks to target our directors' total compensation (defined as total cash compensation and total equity compensation) at or near the median total compensation of the directors of our peers. 
In October of 2016, at the request of our Compensation Committee, Mercer performed and presented to the Compensation Committee a study of reported non-employee director compensation practices (the "2016 Mercer Non-Employee Director Compensation Study"). The 2016 Mercer Non-Employee Director Compensation Study included comparisons of our non-employee director compensation to a peer group of companies, which assisted the Compensation Committee with designing our non-employee director compensation program to be competitive with the peer group and other companies in our markets. 
According to the 2016 Mercer Non-Employee Director Compensation Study, total cash compensation compared to a group of our peers was below the 50th percentile and annual equity compensation was near the 50th percentile, which resulted in total direct compensation below the 50th percentile. The 2016 Mercer Non-Employee Director Compensation Study made the following recommendations for our non-employee directors:
The Compensation Committee considered the 2016 Mercer Non-Employee Director Compensation Study and changes in the Board's structure in 2018 and recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the following non-employee director compensation for 2018:
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following table sets forth the compensation received by each of our directors for the year ended December 31, 2018. Beginning with the Board meeting in April 2018, our directors received one-quarter of the annual cash retainer and one-quarter of the additional cash compensation for serving as the chair of a board committee or as Chairman at each quarterly board meeting: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board has established stock ownership guidelines for our directors to reinforce the importance of aligning the interests of our directors and stockholders. The guidelines generally require directors to meet an equity ownership level with a value equal to or greater than four times the annual cash retainer within five years from the date the director was appointed to the Board. A director has three years to meet an incremental increase in the minimum stock ownership level caused by an increase in the annual retainer. We have adopted retention requirements with respect to these stock ownership guidelines whereby directors are expected to retain shares after withholding any shares to satisfy taxes at the time of vest ("Net Shares") received through an exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock, Restricted Stock Units or phantom stock units with tandem dividend equivalents ("Phantom Stock Units") if they have not satisfied the required equity ownership level. 
The following table sets forth each director's ownership as of March 1, 2019 for stock ownership guidelines purposes: 
Our insider trading policy, among other things, prohibits our directors from hedging the economic risk of their stock ownership, holding shares of the Company's common stock in a margin account, pledging shares as collateral for a loan or short-selling the Company's securities. The policy also prohibits trading in our securities outside of specified window periods and without pre-clearance. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires our executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to report their ownership of our common stock and changes in that ownership. 
We reviewed copies of reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and any written representations from reporting persons that all reportable transactions were reported. Based solely on that review, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all filings required of our executive officers and directors were timely made in accordance with the Exchange Act, except for one Form 4, which was inadvertently filed late by the Company on April 5, 2018 on behalf of William A. Koertner. 
We have a written policy and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related persons, which have been adopted by the Board. Under our policy, the definition of related persons includes, among others, any person who is or was, during the last fiscal year, an executive officer, director or nominee for director of the Company, any stockholder owning more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or an immediate family member of any such person. 
It is the policy of the Company to prohibit related person transactions unless the Company's Audit Committee has determined in advance of the Company or a subsidiary entering into the transaction that it will be conducted on terms that are fair to the Company or the subsidiary and the transaction is in the best interests of the Company or the subsidiary. 
Pursuant to our policy and the SEC and Nasdaq reporting rules, there were no reported transactions in 2018 that qualified as a related person transaction. As a result, no reported transaction was referred to the Audit Committee or any other committee of the Board for review and no related person transaction was required to be disclosed in the Company's filings. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Board established the standing Compensation Committee in accordance with our By-Laws. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee qualifies as an "independent" director as defined under the Nasdaq rules, as a "non-employee director" as defined in Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the Exchange Act and as an "outside director" within the historical meaning of such term for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), as in effect prior to changes made in connection with the December 2017 tax reform. 
The Compensation Committee firmly believes that the compensation of our executive officers should emphasize paying for performance that contributes to our success while encouraging behavior that is in our stockholders' long-term best interests. The Compensation Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing the Company's compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including its executive compensation plans and its incentive-compensation and equity-based plans. To represent and assist the Board in its oversight of the Company's compensation practices and under its charter, the Compensation Committee performs, among others, the following tasks:
The "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" included in this Proxy Statement goes into further detail about the Compensation Committee's processes for determining the appropriate levels of compensation for NEOs and directors. 
In order to fulfill its duties, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain, at the Company's expense, its own advisors and compensation consultants and to approve their compensation. These external compensation consultants provide the Compensation Committee with guidance on compensation trends, program designs and market research and advice and recommendations on both executive and director compensation. They also help evaluate the competitive position of executive officers' and directors' compensation and provide advice on incentive award programs. Their findings are discussed in more detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
Compensation consultants are engaged by and report directly to the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters and meet separately with the Compensation Committee outside the 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
presence of management. Interaction between the compensation consultants and management is generally limited to providing necessary information and data. 
As it has in prior years, the Compensation Committee retained Mercer, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("MMC"), to serve as its executive and director compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee reviewed the independence of Mercer's advisory role relative to the six consultant independence factors adopted by the SEC to guide listed companies in determining the independence of their compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisers. Following its review, the Compensation Committee concluded that Mercer had no conflicts of interest and could provide the Compensation Committee with objective and independent executive and director compensation advice. 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews and provides input on management's succession planning and talent management. This review includes an ongoing evaluation of management's talent and leadership at both the workforce and senior management levels as well as an endorsement of extensive training and professional development programs for all employees. The Compensation Committee believes that a diverse workforce strengthens the Company and, accordingly, considers the importance of diversity in its review of management's succession planning and talent management. 
In reviewing and approving compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considers whether the programs are likely to promote risk-taking behavior that could adversely affect the Company. The Compensation Committee has designed the Company's compensation programs, including the Company's incentive compensation plans, with specific features to address potential risks while rewarding employees for achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives through prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking. The following elements have been incorporated into our programs available for our executive officers:
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Compensation Committee annually performs an assessment of compensation-related risks for all of our compensation policies and programs. These assessments include a review of multiple factors including, but not limited to, the design of compensation policies and programs, controls and approval processes and the discretion provided in the oversight of these programs. Periodically, the Compensation Committee retains outside consultants to assist in these assessments. After its review in 2018, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In the event that the Company's risk profile was to change, the Compensation Committee would consider appropriate adjustments in policies and practices. 
The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation program on behalf of the Board. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" included in this Proxy Statement. 
In reliance on the review and discussion referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" be included in our Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC in connection with our 2019 Annual Meeting and incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 ("2018 Form 10-K"). 
The information contained in the above Compensation Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as amended, except to the extent that MYR Group specifically incorporates it by reference in such filing.
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
Dear Fellow Stockholder, 
Good progress was realized in 2018 in the advancement of the Company's strategy to grow through a balanced combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions that built on our foundation that emphasizes safety and quality relationships. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the design of its compensation programs is an important driver of stockholder value creation at MYR Group by helping us attract, retain and incentivize quality talent. Our programs reward success when the management team's efforts build stockholder value and limit compensation when our performance expectations are not met. We have designed our compensation programs to incentivize employees at all levels within the organization and to specifically reward our key leaders for their contributions to both our short-term and long-term performance. 
We believe that the pay of our executive officers should be linked to our long-term performance; thus, our compensation programs are designed to reward strong financial performance and safe operations. We also recognize the importance of acquiring and retaining the very best employees, and we regularly review our compensation programs to ensure we are competitive with the market for quality talent. In addition, we offer extensive training and professional development programs for all employees to provide them with opportunities for meaningful career paths. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the performance metrics and the equity compensation vehicles used in our long-term equity compensation program to ensure they are aligned with the goals we believe will drive stockholder value. Following our analysis for 2018, we continued to use the financial performance metric of return on invested capital and the market-based metric of relative total stockholder return. We believe these metrics align the long-term equity compensation opportunities of our executive officers with stockholder value creation. In addition to this focus on long-term value, we also provide short-term incentives to employees for both financial and safety performance. 
In addition to our annual "say-on-pay" proposal, we invite our stockholders to provide feedback on our executive compensation programs, as we believe these conversations have improved and will continue to improve our programs. With the positive responses to our "say-on-pay" votes over recent years and based on our annual review of best practices with our independent compensation consultant, we have maintained our fundamental compensation programs and structures. Through these review processes and stockholder feedback, we continue to endeavor to improve these programs with the objective of improving stockholder value. 
On behalf of the Compensation Committee, 
Larry F. Altenbaumer Chair of the Compensation Committee
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the "CD&A") describes the objectives, principles and material components of our executive officer compensation program for our NEOs. 
Our NEOs for 2018 were as follows: 
MYR Group is a holding company of specialty electrical construction service providers that was established through the merger of long-standing specialty contractors. Through our subsidiaries, we serve the electrical utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets throughout the United States and western Canada and have the experience and expertise to complete electrical installations of any type and size. Our Transmission and Distribution ("T&D") segment provides comprehensive services on electric transmission and distribution networks and substation facilities including design, engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade, maintenance and repair services. Our T&D customers include investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, private developers, government-funded utilities, independent power producers, independent transmission companies, industrial facility owners and other contractors. Our C&I segment provides electrical contracting services including the design, installation, maintenance and repair of commercial and industrial wiring, installation of traffic networks and the installation of bridge, roadway and tunnel lighting for general contractors, facility owners, local governments and developers throughout the United States and western Canada. 
Our noteworthy 2018 highlights included the following:
We have designed our compensation programs to reward our key executive officers for their contributions to our short- and long-term performance and to be competitive with programs offered by companies with which we compete for executive officer talent. We believe that the pay of our NEOs should be directly linked to performance; thus, our compensation programs are designed to reward strong financial performance and safe operations. 
In 2018, we did not meet our target pretax financial performance goal resulting in below target annual cash incentive payouts for financial performance under the SMIP, but we exceeded our target safety 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
performance goals resulting in above target annual cash incentive payouts under the SMIP for safety performance. The three-year average 2016 ROIC was below threshold performance, consequently no ROIC performance shares were earned for grants made in 2016, and, for the 2016 TSR performance shares, TSR performance ranked at the 49th percentile and 97% of the target number of TSR performance shares were earned. 
We seek to maintain the competitiveness of our executive compensation program with those of our peers and competitors. Adjustments to both overall compensation and the individual components of compensation are based on various factors, including results of compensation benchmarking studies, general economic conditions, the effects of inflation or other economic forces, changes in our business operations and the related financial results, results of our stockholder vote on our Say-on-Pay proposal and changes in the compensation practices of our competitors. We also take into account each executive officer's individual performance when making compensation adjustments. 
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to:

At our 2018 Annual Meeting, more than 98% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal voted in support of an advisory resolution regarding the compensation of our NEOs. These results demonstrated strong stockholder support for our overall executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee considered this favorable vote and determined that our current practices and processes did not require any significant modifications to address stockholder concerns. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of these annual advisory votes when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
In addition to our annual Say-on-Pay proposal, stockholders are encouraged to provide feedback on our corporate governance policies and our executive compensation programs, including their various components. Management reports to the Compensation Committee on issues or concerns our stockholders provide with respect to our executive compensation programs. We encourage stockholders to reach out to the Board or the Compensation Committee with any feedback on our executive compensation programs. For more information on providing feedback and the related procedures, please see "Corporate Governance — Communications with the Board and Reporting of Concerns" in this Proxy Statement. 
We endeavor to maintain strong compensation practices, which requires effective governance standards with respect to the oversight of our executive compensation policies and practices. Although we do not use a specific formula to determine the mix of at-risk pay that is performance-based and fixed compensation paid to our NEOs, our emphasis on pay-for-performance resulted in at-risk performance-based compensation (which we define as performance share awards and cash awards tied to performance) representing a significant part of our NEOs' target compensation in 2018. In 2018, at-risk performance-based compensation represented approximately 54% of the target total direct compensation for our CEO and an average of approximately 45% of the target total direct compensation for our other NEOs, as shown in the charts below: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
As shown below for 2018, the target total direct compensation for our CEO and other NEOs was generally below the Peer Group median (as discussed below under "Peer Groups, Pay Mix and Use of Compensation Consultants"): 
The Compensation Committee oversees the executive compensation program for our NEOs, as discussed under "Compensation Committee Matters." Our management also plays an important role in setting the compensation of our NEOs by initially recommending various aspects of incentive compensation, including financial performance goals, safety performance goals and strategic goals relating to each NEO. Management also makes recommendations regarding the salary, short-term cash incentive awards and equity awards for our NEOs (other than with respect to our CEO). While our management makes recommendations as to the goals and awards for NEOs' incentive compensation (other than with respect to our CEO), the Compensation Committee has final authority and complete discretion to ultimately set the compensation of our NEOs. 
At the request of the Compensation Committee, our CEO presents to the Compensation Committee his evaluation of the performance of our other NEOs and his recommendations regarding their compensation. The Compensation Committee considers these evaluations and recommendations in determining our NEOs' salaries and the amounts that may be paid under our incentive plans. To assist the Compensation Committee, management also prepares information "tally sheets." The purpose of the tally sheets is to provide the Compensation Committee the information on key elements of actual realized compensation and potential realizable compensation for our NEOs so that the Compensation Committee may fully evaluate our total compensation packages. Further, the Compensation Committee discusses compensation decisions with Mercer, its independent compensation consultant, and deliberates on such decisions without management present. 
The Compensation Committee believes that it is appropriate to utilize compensation benchmarking studies of our peer and competitor companies to establish initial compensation targets because the competitiveness of our compensation practices greatly influences our ability to attract, motivate and retain top executive officer talent, which is an important determinant of our business success. However, the Compensation Committee believes compensation benchmarking studies should be considered only as a point of reference for measurement and not as the determinative factor for our NEOs' compensation. The results of the studies do not supplant the significance of the individual performance of our NEOs that the Compensation Committee considers when making compensation decisions. Because the information provided by compensation benchmark studies is just one of the pieces of information that is used in setting executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has discretion in determining the nature and extent of their use. Further, the Compensation Committee has discretion to determine the frequency of performing benchmarking and other studies. 
We annually compare our compensation program with those companies in a peer group that the Compensation Committee evaluates together with Mercer (the "Peer Group"). The companies selected for inclusion in the Peer Group, which are listed below, were selected on the basis of a number of 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
factors, including similar industry characteristics, organization size and financial characteristics such as revenues, total assets and market capitalization, as well as companies we compete with for talent. At the time of selection, all of the companies were publicly traded U.S. companies in the construction, engineering and commercial services industries with annual revenue between approximately one-half and two times our annual revenue. 
During our 2017 review of the makeup of our Peer Group, we added Argan, Inc. and Superior Energy Services, Inc., given their similar industry characteristics and revenues. The companies included in the Peer Group for the evaluation of 2018 executive compensation were:

In October 2017, Mercer performed and presented to the Compensation Committee an executive compensation study (the "Mercer Executive Compensation Review"). The Mercer Executive Compensation Review included comparisons of our executive compensation programs to the Peer Group, which assisted the Compensation Committee with designing our executive compensation program for 2018 to be competitive with the Peer Group and our markets. According to the Mercer Executive Compensation Review, MYR Group was positioned near the Peer Group median of annual revenue and below the Peer Group median of total assets and market capitalization, respectively, as indicated in the chart below: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Compensation Committee generally considers the median total compensation of the Peer Group in determining total executive compensation and allows business and individual performance to determine whether actual pay is above or below the median. The Compensation Committee believes that this review of Peer Group programs provides valuable information during the Compensation Committee's review and design of both the NEOs' overall compensation levels and individual components of compensation, including the allocation of compensation between long-term and short-term compensation and cash and non-cash compensation. 
Salary is a critical element of our NEOs' compensation because it provides them with a base level of guaranteed monthly income as compensation for services provided to the Company. The Compensation Committee generally reviews the salaries of the NEOs annually. To assist with that review, the Compensation Committee often will refer to the salaries in effect for comparable officers at companies in the Peer Group. The Compensation Committee also considers internal comparables, individual performance and level of responsibility, economic conditions and the Company's financial performance in reviewing salary levels. When market or merit increases are warranted, changes in salary are generally made effective during our second quarter. 
When setting salaries for our NEOs for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the Mercer Executive Compensation Review, as well as certain other factors, including those specified above. As a result, the Compensation Committee made the following decisions related to base salaries for our NEOs in 2018: 
Awards granted under the SMIP are designed to provide our NEOs with annual cash performance awards to reward the achievement of certain performance goals established annually by the Compensation Committee that we believe are strongly linked to stockholder value creation. An important factor in our decision to pay our SMIP awards in cash rather than in equity has been to help ensure that our compensation program remains competitive with the compensation programs of our direct competitors. The Compensation Committee established performance targets based on financial performance and safety performance goals that encouraged our NEOs to increase stockholder value by focusing on growth in revenue and earnings, and to maintain and improve safety performance in operations. These performance goals were the basis for awards under the SMIP for 2018. 
The amount of the payout of awards for each NEO under the SMIP for 2018 depended on the percentage of each NEO's salary that the Compensation Committee determined to be subject to the award, our performance measured against financial and safety performance goals established by the Compensation Committee and an assessment of the NEO's individual performance. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The basic formula for calculating the 2018 SMIP payout is as follows: 
The Compensation Committee determined the percentage of each NEO's salary to be subject to an award under the plan based on position, market pay levels and our overall compensation philosophy, which emphasizes performance-based compensation. No payouts under the 2018 SMIP awards would be made unless the threshold levels for performance goals were achieved. Achievement of the performance goals above the maximum level would not result in any additional payments above the maximum payout level. Any payouts under the 2018 SMIP awards would be calculated by the straight-line mathematical interpolation between (i) threshold and target performance for performance lower than target but greater than threshold or (ii) target and maximum for performance greater than or equal to target but less than or equal to maximum. 
In 2018, each NEO's award opportunity was based on pre-tax income as the financial performance goal and total case incident rate and lost time incident rate as the safety performance goals. We chose these particular metrics because we believe they are strongly correlated with our success and are consistent with our compensation philosophy of linking NEOs' compensation with performance. The financial and safety performance goals are intended to be challenging and ambitious but also realistic enough to be attainable given a concerted effort by our NEOs in consideration of current market and competitive conditions and trends. 
In connection with its review of the percentage of each NEO's salary that should be subject to an award under the SMIP in 2018 and considering the Mercer Executive Compensation Review, the Compensation Committee set the following threshold, target and maximum award opportunities based on the achievement of financial and safety performance goals, subject to the weighting percentages set forth below: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
For 2018, the levels of threshold, target and maximum performance, and the Company's actual performance are shown in the following table: 
The Compensation Committee has discretion to reduce payouts by up to 20% or increase them by up to 15% based on an assessment of each NEO's individual performance throughout the year, including consideration of talent development and successor preparation, contributions toward strategic initiatives, internal controls, business development, acquisition integration and information technology initiatives. At the beginning of 2019, the Compensation Committee conducted a review of the NEOs' performance, with input from the human resources department and other applicable departments, and, based on its qualitative assessment of each NEOs' performance, determined not to decrease or increase the SMIP payout awards to any of the NEOs. 
See "Executive Compensation Tables — 2018 Summary Compensation Table" for the 2018 SMIP payouts to the NEOs. 
We believe that long-term performance is achieved through an ownership culture that rewards and encourages our NEOs to foster our long-term success. We believe that an effective method to reward and encourage such success is through the use of equity compensation awards. The purposes of our long-term incentive plan are to attract, motivate and retain our key employees and non-employee directors upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts the financial success and growth of our business largely depends, to provide additional incentives to our employees and directors through stock ownership and other rights that promote and recognize our financial success and growth, and to align management's interests with those of our stockholders. 
All long-term equity awards granted to NEOs in 2018 were made under the LTIP. The LTIP succeeded the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated as of May 1, 2014) (the "2007 LTIP") in its entirety. Equity grants before March 31, 2017 were made under the 2007 LTIP; all subsequent grants were made under the LTIP. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine who will receive long-term equity awards and the nature, amounts and limitations on those awards. The Compensation Committee also has the authority to cancel outstanding grants and substitute new grants of the same or different number of shares of stock and having exercise prices that may be the same or different than the exercise price of the cancelled grants or amend the terms of outstanding grants, provided that such amendment does not impair the rights of the grantee without the grantee's consent. Our long-term incentive plans prohibit the repricing of outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval. 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the market data with respect to each NEO in the Mercer Executive Compensation Review, compensation levels of executive officers of our Peer Group, and compensation objectives of retention, stockholder value creation and individual and corporate performance. As a result of this review, in February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following mix of equity compensation awards for our NEOs, except for Mr. Engen1: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Compensation Committee elected this mix of equity awards because it represented an appropriate balance of the types of incentives provided by the different types of equity instruments. For example, Restricted Stock Units help to retain key employees and performance shares are designed to vary the level of rewards a NEO receives dependent upon actual corporate performance and market results that are critical to stockholders. 
The 40% of the equity compensation award granted to Messrs. Swartz, Cooper and Waneka and Ms. Johnson as Restricted Stock Units will vest evenly over a three-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant. The number of Restricted Stock Units was determined by dividing the amount of the equity compensation award allocated to Restricted Stock Units by the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant. In light of Mr. Engen's indication of his intention to retire prior to the end of the standard vesting period, 100% of his equity compensation award in 2018 was granted as Restricted Stock Units that will vest at the end of a one-year period. 
The 30% of the equity compensation award granted to Messrs. Swartz, Cooper and Waneka and Ms. Johnson as ROIC-based performance shares can be earned based on the achievement of an average ROIC that is measured over the three-year performance period that starts on January 1, 2018 and ends on December 31, 2020 compared to a target level of average ROIC. For purposes of the ROIC-based performance shares granted in 2018, we define ROIC as net income plus net interest net of taxes, less dividends divided by invested capital (funded debt less cash and marketable securities plus total stockholders' equity) at the beginning of each fiscal year in the performance period computed as follows: 
The target number of ROIC-based performance shares was determined by dividing the amount of the equity compensation award allocated to ROIC performance by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The number of ROIC-based performance shares earned can vary from zero to 200% of the target number of performance shares granted. The potential award levels are as follows (straight-line mathematical interpolation between threshold and target and between target and maximum levels): 
The 30% of the equity compensation award granted to Messrs. Swartz, Cooper and Waneka and Ms. Johnson as TSR-based performance shares can be earned based on the TSR of the Company's stock compared to the TSR of a peer group over the performance period of the equity award grant date, March 23, 2018, to December 31, 2020. We define TSR as the change in the fair market value, adjusted for dividends, of a company's common stock. The measurement of change in fair market value over the performance period is based on the average closing price of common stock for the 20 days preceding the grant date, March 23, 2018, and the 20 days preceding December 31, 2020. The target number of TSR-based performance shares was determined by dividing the amount of the equity compensation award allocated to TSR performance by the fair value of the grant, which was based on a market metric and, therefore, is calculated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of TSR-based performance shares earned can vary from zero to 200% of the target number of performance shares granted. The potential award levels are as follows (straight-line mathematical interpolation between 25th percentile and 50th percentile or between 50th percentile and 75th percentile): 
The Compensation Committee selected the TSR peer group based on each company's industry and operational comparability. The 2018 TSR peer group was comprised of companies that are in either the peer group used in the stock performance graph in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Peer Group used to set 2018 executive compensation or certain industry peers recommended by Mercer. Consequently, Argan, Inc., McDermott International, Inc. and Superior Energy Systems, Inc. were added to the TSR peer group from the prior year. In order to be counted in the final TSR calculations, a company must remain publicly traded during the entire performance period.

With respect to each NEO, the Compensation Committee considered the Mercer Executive Compensation Review, compensation levels of executive officers of our Peer Group, compensation objectives of retention and stockholder value creation and individual and corporate performance, and approved equity award grants to our NEOs in the following amounts based on grant-date fair value, consistent with the presentation in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table: 
The Compensation Committee granted performance share awards in 2016 under the 2007 LTIP which could be earned based on achievement compared to a target level of ROIC, defined as net income plus net interest net of taxes (net income plus net interest, less net interest times the effective tax rate), less 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
dividends divided by invested capital (total debt less cash and marketable securities plus total stockholders' equity) (the "2016 ROIC") measured over a period that started on January 1, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018 and the TSR of the Company's stock compared to the TSR of a peer group over a performance period that started on March 24, 2016 and ended on December 31, 2018 and otherwise contained terms consistent with the performance shares granted in 2018 under the LTIP described above. 
The 2016 ROIC threshold, target and maximum goals were 7.5%, 11.5% and 14.5%, respectively. The Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion to exclude the positive impacts of the Tax Act and the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718) (see footnote 1, Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 included in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K) in its calculation of the three-year average of 2016 ROIC. After this exercise of negative discretion, the three-year average 2016 ROIC was 7.0%, which was below threshold performance, and, consequently, no ROIC performance shares were earned. For the 2016 performance share awards based on TSR, the TSR of the Company's stock ranked at the 49th percentile of the TSR peer group and, consequently, 97.0% of the target TSR performance shares were earned. 
The chart below shows the performance share payouts in 2018 for each of our NEOs that were awarded performance shares in 2016: 
The Compensation Committee also awarded performance shares in 2017 under the 2007 LTIP that can be earned based on achievement compared to a target level of ROIC measured over a period that started on January 1, 2017 and will end on December 31, 2019 and TSR of the Company's stock compared to the TSR of a peer group over a performance period that started on March 23, 2017 and will end on December 31, 2019 and otherwise contain terms consistent with the performance shares granted in 2018 under the LTIP described above. 
We do not publicly disclose specific, forward-looking target levels of ROIC for outstanding performance share awards because these target levels relate to executive compensation to be earned and/or paid in future years, do not reflect a fair understanding of the NEOs' compensation for 2018 and constitute 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
confidential commercial or financial information, the disclosure of which could cause us competitive harm with regard to short-term strategies and goals. We intend to disclose this information after the conclusion of the applicable performance period. When establishing the applicable target levels for the ROIC performance measure, we specifically considered how likely it will be for us to achieve the target levels. We believe that the threshold level will be appropriately difficult to attain, and that the target level will require considerable and increasing collective effort on the part of our employees, including our NEOs, to achieve. Achievement of the maximum level is considered to be a stretch goal given current market conditions. 
Under the terms of the grant agreements, a NEO may earn a pro-rata share of performance shares in the event of his or her death, disability, retirement after reaching normal retirement age (as such is defined in the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended) or termination without "cause" or for "good reason." The vesting of performance shares may be accelerated in the event of a NEO's termination without "cause" or for "good reason" following a "change in control." Additional information regarding these awards may be found in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table and under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
As part of our long-term incentive plan, we include a "change in control" provision that more closely aligns our interests with those of the NEOs in the event of a change in control by allowing the Compensation Committee to adjust long-term incentive equity awards to maintain and protect the rights of the participants in the event of a change in control. 
At its discretion, the Compensation Committee may authorize profit sharing contributions to the Diversified Holdings Savings Plan (our 401(k) plan) accounts of our employees, including our NEOs, subject to applicable limitations. For 2018, we paid 1% of salary in profit sharing contributions. 
Additionally, our employees, including our NEOs, receive matching contributions under our 401(k) plan. We match 100% of an employee's contributions up to the first 6% of such employee's salary, up to the maximum allowed by the plan. 
Each NEO is eligible to utilize the financial planning service offered by the Company as a perquisite. In 2018, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Engen elected to use this service. 
Each NEO is also eligible to participate in all other benefit plans and programs that are or in the future may be available to our other executive employees, including any health insurance or health care plan, life insurance, disability insurance, retirement plan, vacation and sick leave plan and other similar plans. In addition, each NEO is eligible for certain other benefits that are generally available to our employees, including reimbursement of business and entertainment expenses, reimbursement of relocation expenses and perquisites, including the choice of a car allowance or the use of a company car with a gas card. The Board may revise, amend or add to the executive officer's benefits and perquisites as it deems advisable. 
The benefits described in this section are paid to remain competitive in the marketplace. Amounts relating to certain of these benefits may be found in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Executive Compensation Tables — 2018 Summary Compensation Table." 
In connection with our private placement in 2007, we entered into employment agreements with each of the individuals serving as NEOs at the time. These employment agreements remain in place with Messrs. Swartz and Engen. Mr. Swartz's employment agreement was amended and restated in April 2017 to replace the excise tax gross-up provisions in favor of a modified cut-back approach, which is consistent with the provisions that the Company has included in new employment agreements since 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
2011. Ms. Johnson entered into an employment agreement in connection with her appointment as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in October 2015. Mr. Cooper entered into an employment agreement in April 2015 in connection with his appointment as a Senior Vice President. Mr. Waneka entered into an employment agreement in connection with his appointment as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer C&I in December 2017. The employment agreements for Messrs. Swartz, Cooper, Engen and Waneka and Ms. Johnson (each an "Employment Agreement" and collectively, the "Employment Agreements") provide for severance payments and benefits upon a termination of a NEO's employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason," as further described below under "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements." We compete for executive talent in a highly competitive market in which companies routinely offer similar benefits to NEOs. We view the cash severance and continuation of health and welfare benefits provided by these agreements as appropriate for the NEOs who may not be in a position to readily obtain comparable employment within a reasonable period of time due to the restrictive covenants, including a one-year non-compete covenant, in the Employment Agreements. 
In addition, the Employment Agreements provide for additional severance payments and benefits upon a termination of a NEO's employment without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" within one year following a change in control (in other words, only on a so-called "double trigger" basis). We believe that providing change in control benefits reduces the potential reluctance of our NEOs to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in our best interest while simultaneously preserving neutrality in negotiating and executing transactions that are favorable to us. Since 2011, the Compensation Committee has maintained a policy that it will not include gross-up payments for excise taxes as a result of a change in control pursuant to any new employment agreement. Accordingly, the employment agreements for Messrs. Swartz, Cooper and Waneka and Ms. Johnson do not include any provisions to provide gross-up payments for excise taxes as a result of a change in control. Details regarding severance payments and benefits payable upon a termination of a NEO's employment following a change in control are described under "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" and "— Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
In developing the compensation packages for the NEOs, the Compensation Committee generally considered the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code. Section 162(m) generally disallows a tax deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, to certain former executive officers) to the extent that the compensation for any such individual exceeds $1,000,000 in any taxable year. Historically, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" could be excluded from this $1,000,000 limit. This exception has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except for certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 for which transition relief is available. In order to maintain flexibility in making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. Portions of the compensation we paid to NEOs in 2018 may not be deductible due to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code and, with the general elimination of the "performance-based" exception and the expansion of the definition of "covered employees" brought about by 2017 tax reform, the Compensation Committee is likely to approve compensation that is not deductible under Section 162(m). In addition, because of the uncertainties associated with the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, there can be no assurance that compensation intended to satisfy requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m), as in effect prior to 2018, will in fact be deductible. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
In order to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders, our NEOs are expected to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership measured based on a multiple of his or her annual base salary, as set forth below: 
Under our stock ownership guidelines, our NEOs are expected to attain levels of beneficial stock ownership within five years from the later of the date of the NEO's appointment to a position subject to the guidelines and three years from the effective date of an increase in compensation. We have adopted retention requirements with respect to these stock ownership guidelines whereby NEOs are expected to retain the Net Shares received through an exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock, Restricted Stock Units and performance shares if they have not reached the applicable stock ownership guidelines. 
The following table sets forth each NEO's ownership value as of March 1, 2019: 
We also have an insider trading policy which, among other things, prohibits NEOs from hedging the economic risk of their stock ownership, holding shares of the Company's common stock in a margin account, pledging shares as collateral for a loan or short-selling the Company's securities. Among other restrictions, the policy also prohibits trading in our securities outside of specific window periods and without pre-clearance. 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Each of the agreements underlying equity awards granted to our NEOs under the LTIP and its predecessor, the 2007 LTIP, as applicable, permits the Compensation Committee to cause us to recover shares of common stock or cash paid to the NEO with respect to the applicable award if:
For grants of restricted stock and Restricted Stock Units, we may recover any shares that vested within the period of 18 months prior to the restatement or the net proceeds of any sales of such shares. With respect to performance shares, the amount of any cash or shares recoverable is limited to the amount by which the payments exceeded the amount that would have been paid to the NEO had our financial statements for the applicable restated fiscal year or years been initially filed as restated, as reasonably determined by the Compensation Committee. In the case of stock options, to the extent an applicable NEO exercises a stock option within a period of 18 months prior to the restatement, we may recover from the NEO any equity acquired by the NEO or any net proceeds of any exercises and sales. 
We have designed and administer our compensation programs in a manner that emphasizes the retention of our NEOs and rewards them appropriately for positive results. We monitor the programs in recognition of the dynamic marketplace in which we compete for talent and will continue to emphasize pay-for-performance and equity-based incentive plans that reward our NEOs for results aligned with the interests of our stockholders.

The following table sets forth the estimated future payouts for grants of awards made to each of the NEOs under the SMIP and LTIP for 2018:

Under each Employment Agreement, the NEO is eligible to receive salary, an annual cash incentive award, as defined under the SMIP, severance pay under certain conditions, use of a company car and gas card or a car allowance in accordance with the Company's policy, and is eligible to participate in all incentive, 401(k), profit sharing, health and welfare benefit plans, policies and arrangements applicable generally to our other similarly-situated executive officers. Subject to prior notice, each Employment Agreement automatically renews annually for an additional one-year term. 
Each Employment Agreement contains non-competition covenants restricting the ability of the NEO to compete with us, to solicit our clients or to recruit our employees during the term of his or her employment and for a period of one year thereafter and prohibiting him or her from disclosing confidential information and trade secrets at any time during or after his or her employment. 
Each Employment Agreement generally terminates upon the NEO's:
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
If termination results from any of the foregoing, each NEO is entitled to all compensation earned and all benefits and reimbursements due through the date of termination. Additionally, if termination results from any of the reasons below, the NEO would be entitled to the following additional payments and/or benefits: 
Each Employment Agreement generally defines "cause" as a NEO's:
"Good reason" for a NEO's resignation exists under each Employment Agreement if, among other things, the NEO's base salary and/or annual target incentive opportunity is reduced, his or her duties are materially reduced, he or she is required to relocate to a work site more than 50 miles from his or her current work site or if the Company materially breaches a material provision of the NEO's Employment Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of the receipt of written notice of the breach. 
Each Employment Agreement generally defines a "change in control" as the occurrence of a "change in the ownership of the Company," a "change in the effective control of the Company" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the Company's assets" as defined in Treasury Regulation §§1.409A-3(i)(5)(v), (vi) and (vii), respectively. As described above, if a NEO is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 12 months following a "change in control," the NEO would be entitled to all compensation earned and all benefits and reimbursements due through the date of termination, as well as a lump-sum payment equal to three times the NEO's base salary, three times target annual 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
incentive and company-funded benefit continuation coverage for the NEO and eligible dependents for a period of two years, subject to forfeiture in the event the NEO becomes reemployed in the two-year period following his or her termination and, under Mr. Engen's employment agreement only, gross-up payments for any excise taxes incurred under Sections 280G of the Code. 
The foregoing descriptions of the terms of the Employment Agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms and conditions of such agreements that the Company has filed with the SEC. 
"Change in control" is similarly defined in the LTIP and its predecessor, the 2007 LTIP. Under the terms of the long-term incentive plans, award agreements may provide for one or more of the following effects in connection with a change in control:

As described above under "Employment Agreements," our NEOs have severance and change in control clauses in their Employment Agreements. The following table summarizes and quantifies the compensation that would have become payable to each current NEO upon termination or a change in control (and qualifying termination) on December 31, 2018, given the NEO's compensation and service levels as of such date: 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
We believe our compensation programs must be consistent and internally equitable. The following is a reasonable estimate, prepared under applicable SEC rules, of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. Last year, we identified the median employee by calculating the salary or wages of each full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employee paid in 2017 through December 24, 2017 (the determination date), ranking the salary or wages of all employees except for the CEO from lowest to highest. We applied a Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate to the compensation elements paid in Canadian currency for our Canadian employees. 
For the 2018 pay ratio disclosure, we have not used the same median employee from the prior year. There have been no changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. However, last year's median employee has had a change of circumstances that we believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosure. As a result, we believe it is no longer appropriate to use last year's median employee as the median employee for this year's pay ratio calculation. Using the compensation measure used to select last year's median employee, we identified an employee whose compensation is substantially similar to that of last year's median employee. 
The ratio between the pay of our CEO to the pay of our median employee is 21:1. The annual total compensation for our median employee for 2018 was $86,608. The annual total compensation of our CEO was $1,838,238. The difference between this annual total compensation and the annual total compensation found in "Executive Compensation Tables — 2018 Summary Compensation Table" is due to the inclusion of nondiscriminatory health and welfare benefit plans that are not required to be included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE ADVISORY RESOLUTION REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 
As required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve an advisory resolution on the compensation of our NEOs as reported in this Proxy Statement. As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee has designed our executive compensation program to align each NEO's compensation with our short-term and long-term performance and to provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain the NEOs who are crucial to our success. We urge stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the related tables and narratives, which describe in more detail how our NEO compensation policies and procedures operate and how they achieve our compensation objectives. All of this information provides detailed discussion and analysis of the compensation of our NEOs including the following:
We ask our stockholders to participate annually in this review and indicate their support for our NEO compensation set forth in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. We are asking our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis", the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures." 
The Say-on-Pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we expect to consider our stockholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.

The Board established the standing Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Board has determined that all of the Audit Committee members are independent as required by the Nasdaq's listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The Board has also determined that all committee members are financially literate within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and that Mr. Moore is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations. None of the Audit Committee members have participated in the preparation of our financial statements during the past three years. 
The Board values the integrity of MYR Group's financial statements and internal controls. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in monitoring the integrity of MYR Group's financial statements, MYR Group's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the independence and performance of MYR Group's internal and external auditors. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee performs, among other tasks, the following duties to represent and assist the Board in its oversight of the Company's financial statements:
The Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment, on a confidential basis, of complaints received by the Company. The Audit Committee encourages employees and outsiders to report concerns about our accounting controls, auditing matters or anything else that appears to involve financial or other wrongdoing. To report such matters, you should call the Company's Anonymous Incident Reporting System, MySafeWorkplace, at 1-800-461-9330. All complaints received are confidential and anonymous and will be retained for the Company's records. At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and its charter. During this review, the Audit Committee is able to analyze its responsibilities and progress as well as ensure that these documents comply with current regulatory requirements. 
Consistent with the requirements of the SEC and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation for and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before we engage the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018, as described below, were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the foregoing pre-approval policies and procedures. 
On February 28, 2018, the Audit Committee appointed Crowe to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Aggregate fees paid for professional services rendered by Crowe in 2018, and Crowe and Ernst & Young, LLP ("EY"), the Company's prior independent registered public accounting firm, in 2017 were as follows: 
In the above table, in accordance with the SEC rules, "Audit Fees" are fees that we paid for the audit of our annual financial statements included in the 2018 Form 10-K, review of financial statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and for services that are normally provided by the auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. 
"Audit-Related Fees" are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. "Tax Fees" are fees for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. 
As previously reported, on June 28, 2017, the Audit Committee appointed Crowe to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. In connection therewith, the Audit Committee dismissed EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the subsequent interim period through June 28, 2017, neither the Company, nor anyone acting on its behalf, consulted with Crowe, regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Company by Crowe that Crowe concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a "reportable event" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
EY's audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. 
During the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the subsequent interim period through June 28, 2017, (i) there were no "disagreements" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to EY's satisfaction, would have caused EY to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their reports; and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
In accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, the Company requested that EY furnish it with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not EY agrees with the Company's statements relating to EY included in Item 4.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 30, 2017. EY furnished the requested letter, stating its agreement with such statements, and a copy is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's June 30, 2017 8-K. 
As part of our activities, we reviewed and discussed MYR Group's audited financial statements with management. Additionally, we received Crowe's written disclosures and letter dated March 6, 2019, as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and have discussed with Crowe their independence. We also reviewed and discussed with Crowe the matters required to be discussed under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communications with Audit Committees), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. Based upon this review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our 2018 Form 10-K. 
The information contained in the above Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as amended, except to the extent that MYR Group specifically incorporates it by reference in such filing.
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Audit Committee is responsible for the selection, retention, termination and oversight of our independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee appointed Crowe as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee and the Board are requesting, as a matter of policy, that stockholders ratify the appointment of Crowe as our independent auditors. The Board and the Audit Committee are not required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, if the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may investigate the reasons for such rejection. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time. 
We expect that representatives of Crowe will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, that they will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire and that they will have an opportunity to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

With respect to the election of directors, you may vote FOR, vote AGAINST or vote to ABSTAIN with respect to each of the nominees. Our By-Laws provide for a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections as will be held at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As amended, the By-Laws provide that a director nominee in an uncontested election will be elected if the number of shares voted FOR the director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast on the issue of that director's election (including votes FOR or votes AGAINST but excluding any votes to ABSTAIN or broker non-votes). If a director in an uncontested election fails to receive the required number of votes for re-election in an uncontested election, the director is expected to tender his or her resignation for prompt consideration by the Board. A director whose resignation is under consideration is expected to abstain from participating in any decision regarding that resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept or reject a director's resignation. 
You may vote FOR, vote AGAINST or vote to ABSTAIN with respect to the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs and the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. In order to be approved, each of these two proposals requires the affirmative FOR vote of a majority of those shares present (either in person or represented by proxy) and entitled to vote on those proposals. Any ABSTAIN vote will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST a matter. 
A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on "routine" matters without instructions from the beneficial holder of those shares. On the other hand, absent instructions from the beneficial holders of such shares, a broker will not be entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on "non-routine" proposals, such as the election of directors. This would be a "broker non-vote" and these shares will not be counted as having been voted on the applicable proposal. Consequently, if your shares are held by a broker on your behalf (that is, in "street name"), and you do not instruct your broker as to how to vote on Proposals 1 and 2, the broker may not exercise discretion to vote for or against such proposal. With respect to Proposal 3, the broker may exercise its discretion to vote for or against that proposal in the absence of your instruction. We strongly encourage you to instruct your bank or broker on how you would like to vote so your vote can be counted on all proposals.

Your shares will be voted as you direct if you vote by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card. If you sign and return the enclosed proxy card but do not specify how you would like your shares voted, they will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations on all matters or, if no recommendation is given, in accordance with the proxies' best judgment. 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to validly hold the 2019 Annual Meeting. A quorum will be present if at least a majority of our outstanding shares on the Record Date are represented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., when a stockholder does not provide voting instructions to their broker or nominee) will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 
If you would like to change your vote after submitting your proxy and prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting, you can revoke your proxy and change your proxy instructions by (a) signing and submitting another proxy card with a later date or (b) voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Alternatively, you may provide a written statement of your intention to revoke your proxy to our Secretary at MYR Group Inc., 1701 Golf Road, Suite 3-1012, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008. If your shares are held in street name (i.e., your shares are held in an account through your broker), you should contact your bank or broker for specific instructions on how to change your vote. 
Attendance at the meeting is limited to the Company's stockholders and its invited guests. If you hold shares in your name, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license. If you hold your shares through a bank or broker (i.e., in "street-name"), you will need proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or letter from your bank or broker, along with proper identification. Even if you wish to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, we urge you to cast your vote using the enclosed proxy card as soon as possible. If you choose to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, it will revoke any previous proxy submitted. If you hold your shares in street-name and wish to vote in person at the meeting, you must provide a legal proxy obtained from your bank or broker. 
MYR Group bears the cost of soliciting your vote. In addition to mailing these proxy materials, our directors, officers or employees may solicit proxies or votes in person, by telephone or by electronic communication. They will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We may enlist the help of banks and brokerage houses in soliciting proxies from their customers and reimburse the banks and brokerage houses for related out-of-pocket expenses. We retained Morrow Sodali LLC to aid in soliciting votes for the 2019 Annual Meeting for a total fee of $7,500 plus reasonable expenses. 
Unless you advised otherwise, if you hold your shares in street name and you and other residents at your mailing address share the same last name and also own shares of our common stock in an account at the same broker, bank or other nominee, we delivered a single Notice of Meeting or set of proxy materials to your address. This method of delivery is known as householding. Householding reduces the number of mailings you receive, saves on printing and postage costs and helps the environment. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate voting instruction forms. We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Meeting or set of proxy materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the materials was delivered. A stockholder who wishes to receive a separate copy of the Notice of Meeting 
    MYR GROUP INC. | 2019 PROXY STATEMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS
or proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting should submit this request by contacting Morrow Sodali, LLC, our proxy solicitor for the 2019 Annual Meeting, by email at myrteam@morrowsodali.com, in writing at 470 West Avenue, Suite 3000, Stamford, CT 06902 or by calling 1-800-662-5200. If you would like to opt out of householding, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee. Beneficial owners sharing an address who are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and who wish to receive a single copy of these materials in the future will need to contact their broker, bank or other nominee to request that only a single copy of each document be mailed to all stockholders at the shared address in the future. 
If you are a registered stockholder, we sent you and each registered stockholder at your address a separate Notice of Meeting or set of proxy materials. 
As the appointed independent tabulator, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC will receive the proxies and tabulate the votes cast. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC will act as the independent inspector of election and will certify the results. Your vote will not be disclosed to our directors, officers or employees, except (a) as necessary to meet legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against us; (b) in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; (c) if you provide a comment with your proxy or otherwise communicate your vote to us or (d) as necessary to allow the independent inspector of election to certify the results. 
Voting results will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC after the 2019 Annual Meeting. This Form 8-K will also be available on our website at www.myrgroup.com.
