This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by our board of directors, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the board, of proxies from holders of shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which we refer to in this proxy statement as our common stock, to be used at the annual meeting, and at any and all adjournments thereof.

The Company is holding the annual meeting at this time to satisfy certain listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). 
The Initial Business Combination
On August 23, 2018 (the "Closing Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of the equity interests in certain of the subsidiaries (the "Royal Entities") of Noble Royalties Acquisition Co., LP ("NRAC"), Hooks Ranch Holdings LP ("Hooks Holdings"), DGK ORRI Holdings, LP ("DGK"), DGK ORRI GP LLC ("DGK GP") and Hooks Holding Company GP, LLC ("Hooks GP", and collectively with NRAC, Hooks Holdings, DGK, and DGK GP, the "Contributors"). The acquisition was made pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2018 (the "Contribution Agreement"), by and among the Company, Royal Resources L.P. ("Royal"), Royal Resources GP L.L.C. ("Royal GP") and the Contributors. The acquisition of the Royal Entities pursuant to the Contribution Agreement is referred to herein as the "Business Combination" and the Business Combination together with the other the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement are referred to herein as the "Transactions."
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company contributed cash to Falcon Minerals Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Opco"), in exchange for (a) a number of common units representing limited partnership interests in Opco (the "Common Units") equal to the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock, par value $0.0001  per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), outstanding as of the Closing Date and (b) a number of Opco warrants exercisable for Common Units equal to the number of the Company's warrants outstanding as of the Closing Date. The Company controls Opco through Falcon Minerals GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the sole general partner of Opco ("Opco GP").
In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company changed its name from "Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp." to "Falcon Minerals Corporation." The Company is now operated as an "Up-C," meaning that substantially all the assets of the Company are held by Opco, and the Company's only asset is its equity interest in Opco. Each Common Unit, together with one share of Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class C Common Stock"), is exchangeable for one share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder pursuant to the terms of the Company's and Opco's organizational documents, subject to certain restrictions.
Also in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company entered into a Shareholders' Agreement dated as of August 23, 2018, pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed that its board of directors will initially be comprised of eleven directors, divided into three class of directors, consisting of (a) six (6) directors to be designated by Blackstone, (b) two (2) directors to be designated by our Sponsor, and (c) three (3) independent directors to be mutually selected by Blackstone and our Sponsor. Blackstone has designated three (3) directors to serve on the Company's board of directors, and retains the right to fill the three (3) remaining vacancies pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement. For additional information, please see "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions — The Business Combination — Shareholders Agreement." 
Revocation of Proxy
If a proxy in the accompanying form is executed and returned, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time before its exercise by giving written notice of revocation to our Secretary at the address given at the top of this proxy statement, by submitting a later dated proxy or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.
Expenses and Manner of Solicitation
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies for the annual meeting. We have engaged Morrow Sodali LLC, which we refer to as Morrow, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the annual meeting. We have agreed to pay Morrow a fee of $6,500. We will reimburse Morrow for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Morrow and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses. In addition to solicitations by mail, we may, through our directors and officers, solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by electronic means. Such directors and officers will not receive any special remuneration for these efforts. VOTING AT THE ANNUAL MEETING
We have an authorized capitalization of 361,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 360,000,000 shares of common stock, including (i) 240,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) no shares of Class B Common Stock, and (iii) 120,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Class A Common Stock and holders of the Class C Common Stock vote together as a single class. Each holder is entitled to one vote per share on each matter of business properly brought before the annual meeting. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. We refer to the Class A Common Stock and the Class C Common Stock collectively as the common stock. At the annual meeting, only those holders of shares of common stock at the close of business on October 22, 2018, the record date, will be entitled to vote. As of the record date, 85,855,000 shares of common stock were outstanding.
Record holders of common stock can vote by the following methods:
• By mail.    You may vote by proxy by completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid return envelope.
• Via the Internet.    You may vote by submitting a proxy via the Internet until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 13, 2018 by accessing the website listed on your proxy card, www.cstproxyvote.com, and following the instructions you will find on the website. Internet proxy submission is available 24 hours a day.
• In person.    You may attend the annual meeting and vote in person using the ballot provided to you at the annual meeting.
Beneficial owners of shares held in street name may instruct their bank, broker or other nominee how to vote their shares. Beneficial owners should refer to the materials provided to them by their nominee for information on communicating these "voting instructions." Beneficial owners may not vote their shares in person at the annual meeting unless they obtain a legal proxy from the stockholder of record, present it to the inspector of election at the annual meeting and produce valid identification. Beneficial owners should contact their bank, broker or other nominee for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy.
The presence at the annual meeting in person or by proxy of holders of outstanding shares of common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the annual meeting will constitute a quorum. The presence of a quorum for any proposal establishes a quorum for all of the proposals, even if holders of outstanding shares of common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the annual meeting do not vote on all of the proposals.
Shares of common stock represented at the annual meeting in person or by proxy but not voted on one or more proposals will be included in determining the presence of a quorum for all of the proposals, but will not be considered cast on any proposal on which they were not voted. A failure by brokers to vote in person or by proxy shares of common stock held by them in nominee name will mean that such shares of common stock will not be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not be voted.
We refer to the situation where a broker does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of shares of common stock on a particular matter and indicates on the proxy delivered with respect to such shares of common stock that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter as a broker "non-vote." For broker non-votes, those shares of common stock will be considered as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists, but will not be considered cast on any proposal on which they were not voted. With respect to abstentions, those shares of common stock will be considered as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists, but, under Delaware law, are not considered to be votes cast on a proposal.
Brokers that are member firms of the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, and who hold shares of common stock in street name for customers generally may vote their customers' shares on proposals considered to be "routine" matters under Nasdaq rules and may not vote their customers' shares on proposals that are not considered to be "routine" matters under Nasdaq rules if the customers have not furnished voting instructions within a specified period of time prior to the annual meeting. Proposal 1 is not considered to be a "routine" matter under Nasdaq rules. Proposal 2 is considered a "routine" matter under Nasdaq rules. Proposal 1.    In order to be elected as a Class I director as described in Proposal 1 below, a nominee must receive a plurality of all the votes cast at the annual meeting at which a quorum is present, which means that the nominees with the most votes are elected. Abstentions (withholding a vote) and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors.
Proposal 2.    The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the meeting at which a quorum is present is required to approve the selection of Deloitte & Touche, LLP, or Deloitte, as our independent registered public accounting firm as described in our discussion of Proposal 2 below. Abstentions will have no effect on Proposal No. 2. Broker non-votes will be counted as voted "FOR" Proposal No. 2.
Proposal 3.    For any other matter which may properly come before the annual meeting as described in our discussion of Proposal 3 below, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting at which a quorum is present is required, either in person or by proxy, for approval, unless otherwise required by law.
Any proxy not specifying to the contrary, and not designated as a broker non-vote, will be voted "FOR" the election of the directors and  the approval of the selection of Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.
Should any matters not described above be properly presented at the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote in accordance with their judgment. The proxy authorizes these persons, in their discretion, to vote upon such matters as may properly be brought before the annual meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof.
Stockholders who have questions or need assistance in completing or submitting their proxy cards should contact our proxy solicitor, Morrow, at (800) 662-5200 or by sending a letter to 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902 or by email to FLMN.info@morrowsodali.com. PROPOSAL 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Proposal 1 is to elect Steven R. Jones to serve as our Class I director. The board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. The term of the initial Class I directors expires at the annual meeting; the term of the initial Class II directors expires at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the consummation of the Business Combination; and the term of the initial Class III directors expires at the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the consummation of the Business Combination. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, beginning with the annual meeting, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or until the election and qualification of their respective successors in office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. The board, upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has nominated Steven R. Jones for election at the annual meeting as Class I directors for a term to expire at the 2021 meeting of stockholders or until his successor is elected or appointed, subject to his earlier death, resignation or removal. David I. Foley, currently a Class I director, will not stand for reelection at the annual meeting. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE NOMINEE NAMED IN PROPOSAL 1.
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy, in the absence of a contrary direction, to vote for the election of the nominee named in Proposal 1. Should the nominee become unable or refuse to accept nomination or election as a director, the persons named as proxies intend to vote for the election of such other person as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may recommend. The board knows of no reason why the nominee might be unable or refuse to accept nomination or election.

Corporate Profile
Our shares of Class A Common Stock are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, under the symbol "FLMN" and we are subject to Nasdaq listing standards. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected each year. The term of office of the Class I directors, consisting of Messrs. Jones and Foley, will expire at the annual meeting. Mr. Foley will not stand for reelection at the annual meeting. The term of office of the Class II directors, consisting of Messrs. Anderson, Hamilton and Jenkins, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Business Combination. The term of office of the Class III directors, consisting of Mr. J. Cohen, E. Cohen, Acconcia and Frank will expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Business Combination. The NASDAQ Capital Market ("NASDAQ") listing standards require that a majority of our Board be independent. The Board has determined that Messrs. Anderson, Foley, Acconcia, Jenkins, Hamilton, Frank and Jones are independent within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2).
We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and charters for the audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees of the Board intended to satisfy Nasdaq listing standards. We have also adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for our directors, officers and employees intended to satisfy Nasdaq listing standards and the definition of a "code of ethics" set forth in applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules. Our corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics and committee charters are available on our website at www.falconminerals.com. The information on our website is not part of this proxy statement.
We do not have a policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings, but encourage the directors to attend if possible.
Board Committees
The standing committees of the Company's Board consist of an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Each of the committees reports to the Board. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these committees are set forth below.
Audit Committee
The Nasdaq rules and Section 10A of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. We have established an audit committee of the board of directors, which consists of Messrs. Frank, Jones and Anderson. Each of Messrs. Frank, Jones and Anderson meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards and under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Frank serves as Chairman of our audit committee. 
The audit committee's duties, which are specified in our Audit Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's website, include, but are not limited to:
• audits of the Company's financial statements;
• the integrity of the Company's financial statements;
• the Company's process relating to risk management and the conduct and systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures;
• the qualifications, engagement, compensation, independence and performance of the Company's independent auditor; and
• the performance of the Company's internal audit function.
Financial Expert on Audit Committee
The audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of independent directors who are "financially literate" as defined under Nasdaq listing standards. The Nasdaq listing standards define "financially literate" as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. In addition, we must certify to the NASDAQ Capital Market that the audit committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual's financial sophistication. We have determined that Messrs. Frank and Jones satisfy Nasdaq's definition of financial sophistication and also qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.
Compensation Committee
We have established a compensation committee of the board of directors, which consists of Messrs. Acconcia, Jenkins and Frank. Each of Messrs. Acconcia, Jenkins and Frank meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards. Mr. Acconcia serves as Chairman of our compensation committee.
The compensation committee's duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's website, include, but are not limited to:
• determining and approving the compensation of executive officers; and
• reviewing and approving incentive compensation and equity compensation policies and programs.
The charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
We have established a nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, which consists of Messrs. Hamilton, Foley and Jones. Each of Messrs. Hamilton, Foley and Jones meets the independent director standard under Nasdaq listing standards. Mr. Foley currently serves as Chairman of our nominating and corporate governance committee, however, as Mr. Foley will not stand for reelection at the annual meeting, the board of directors has appointed Mr. Hamilton as Chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee effective as of the annual meeting.
The nominating and corporate governance committee's duties, which are specified in our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, which is available on the Company's website, include, but are not limited to:
• identifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors and recommending to the Board candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the Board;
• developing, recommending to the Board and overseeing implementation of the Company's corporate governance guidelines;
• coordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the Board, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and
• reviewing on a regular basis the Company's overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.
The nominating and corporate governance committee also develops and recommends to the Board corporate governance principles and practices and assists in implementing them, including conducting a regular review of our corporate governance principles and practices. 
Subject to the Shareholders Agreement discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, which provides certain of our stockholders with rights to designate director nominees, the nominating and corporate governance committee expects to use a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. In recommending director nominees to the Board apart from those nominees designated pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, the committee expects it will solicit candidate recommendations from its own members, other directors and management. It also  may engage the services and pay the fees of a professional search firm to assist it in identifying potential director nominees. The committee will assess the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. If vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, and the designation provisions of the Shareholders Agreement do not apply, the committee will consider whether to fill those vacancies and, if applicable, will consider various potential director candidates. The committee expects to evaluate any such candidates at regular or special meetings of the committee, and may be considered at any point during the year.
The nominating and corporate governance committee has not adopted specific, minimum qualifications or specific qualities or skills that must be met by a nominating committee-recommended nominee. The committee will seek to ensure that the membership of the Board and each committee of the Board satisfies all relevant Nasdaq listing standard requirements and applicable laws and regulations and all requirements of our governance documents. The nature of the specific qualifications, qualities, experience or skills (including international versus domestic background, diversity, age, and legal and regulatory requirements) that the committee may look for in any particular director. A nominee who is not a designee under the Shareholders Agreement will depend on the qualifications, qualities, experience and skills of the rest of the directors at the time of any vacancy on the Board. The committee does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees beyond being committed to ensuring that no person would be excluded from consideration for service as a director as a result of their sex, race, religion, creed, sexual orientation or disability.
The nominating and corporate governance committee will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting. Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our Board should follow the procedures set forth in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees intended to satisfy Nasdaq listing standards and the definition of a "code of ethics" set forth in applicable SEC rules. Our code of business conduct and ethics is available on the Company's website.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Jonathan Z. Cohen serves as the Chairman of the Board and Daniel C. Herz serves as our Chief Executive Officer. We believe that the most effective leadership structure at the present time is to have separate Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions because this allows the board of directors to benefit from having two strong voices bringing separate views and perspectives to meetings.
Our Board is responsible for overseeing the overall risk management process at our company. Risk management is considered a strategic activity within our company and, responsibility for managing risk currently rests with executive management while the Board participates in the oversight of the process. The oversight responsibility of our Board is enabled by management reporting processes designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks. Those areas of focus include strategic, operational, financial and reporting, compliance and other risks. We expect the Board of our post-business combination company to develop its own risk management policies with respect to the combined company. Further, we expect that the post-business combination audit committee will enhance the Board's oversight of risk management and that it will discuss with management, the independent auditor and the internal auditor policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including significant operating and financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor, control and report such exposures. We also expect that the post-business combination compensation committee will enhance the Board's oversight of risk management by considering the impact of the Company's compensation plans, and the incentives created by the Company's compensation plans, on the Company's risk profile.
Stockholder and Interested Party Communications
Prior to the Business Combination, our Board did not provide a process for stockholders or other interested parties to send communications to the Board or particular members of the Board because management believed that it was premature to develop such processes given the limited liquidity of our common stock at the time and  our structure as a special purpose acquisition company formed to seek a business combination. Stockholders or other interested parties may communicate directly with the Board or particular members of the Board by sending their communications to our counsel, Ledgewood, P.C., at Two Commerce Square, 2001 Market Street, Suite 3400, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Ledgewood will forward these communications to the Chairman, who will distribute them to the board members to whom the communications are addressed.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Mr. Daniel C. Herz served as a member of our compensation committee during the last completed fiscal year, at which time he also served as our President. Mr. Herz received no compensation for his service as an executive officer or director. Messrs. E. Cohen and J.

In July 2018, Mr. Herz resigned as a director and Mr. Anderson was appointed to the audit committee. We expect that the current members of the audit committee will perform the review and have the discussions referred to above with respect to fiscal 2018 prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018. of Atlas Energy Group, LLC, an entity of which Mr. Herz previously served as an executive officer.

PROPOSAL 2. APPROVAL OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Approval of Deloitte
We are asking our stockholders to approve the selection of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Although approval is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte to our stockholders for approval as a matter of good corporate practice. If Deloitte is not approved, the audit committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if Deloitte is approved, the audit committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE SELECTION OF DELOITTE TO AUDIT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018.
Audit Fees and Services
The firm of Marcum LLP, or Marcum, acted as our independent registered public accounting firm during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. On August 27, 2018, the audit committee approved the engagement of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm following the completion of the Business Combination. We do not expect that representatives of Marcum or Deloitte will be present at the annual meeting, however, if present, these representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. The following is a summary of fees paid to Marcum for services rendered.
Audit Fees
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, audit fees for our independent registered public accounting firm were $82,915 and $-0- respectively. Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings.
Audit-Related Fees
Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our independent public accounting firm did not render any audit-related services.
Tax Fees
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our independent registered public accounting firm did not render any fees for tax services to us.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Our audit committee, on at least an annual basis, reviews audit and non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm as well as the fees charged for such services. Our policy is that all audit and non-audit services must be pre-approved by the audit committee. All of such services and fees were pre-approved during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. PROPOSAL 3. OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board does not intend to present and has not been informed that any other person intends to present any other matters for action at the annual meeting. However, if other matters do properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote upon them in accordance with their best judgment. For any other matter which may properly come before the annual meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting at which a quorum is present is required, either in person or by proxy, for approval, unless otherwise required by law.
Except as set forth in this section, all shares of common stock represented by valid proxies received will be voted in accordance with the provisions of the proxy. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth information known to us regarding beneficial ownership of shares of our voting common stock as of November 11, 2018 by:
• each person who is known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of our common stock;
• each current executive officer and director of the Company; and
• all current executive officers and directors of the Company, as a group.
Pursuant to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, each share of Class C Common Stock, representing a non-economic interest in the Company, entitles the holder to one vote per share. The table below represents beneficial ownership of voting common stock, composed of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, and is reported in accordance with the beneficial ownership rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission under which a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power with respect to such security or has the right to acquire such ownership within 60 days.  Accordingly, shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage of the person or group holding such warrants but are not deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage of any other person.
The beneficial ownership of the Company's voting common stock is based on 85,855,000 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 45,855,000 shares are Class A Common Stock and 40,000,000 shares are Class C Common Stock.
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
None of our executive officers or directors received any compensation (cash or non-cash) for services rendered prior to the Business Combination. We did not pay compensation of any kind, including finder's and consulting fees, to holders of founder shares, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination other than (i) repayment of loans made to us by our Sponsor to cover initial public offering-relating and organization expenses and (ii) repayment of incremental loans made by our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with the Business Combination. However, these individuals were reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, including the Business Combination. Our audit committee was required to approve all payments in excess of $5,000 to be made to our Sponsor, our directors and officers or their respective affiliates. We were not a party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provided for benefits upon termination of employment.
Following the Business Combination, we expect the Company to adopt an executive compensation program designed to align compensation with its business objectives and the creation of stockholder value, while enabling the Company to attract, motivate and retain individuals who contribute to the long-term success of the Company.
Decisions on the executive compensation program will be made by the compensation committee, which consists of Messrs. Acconcia, Jenkins and Frank. The following discussion is based on the present expectations as to the executive compensation program to be adopted by the compensation committee. The executive compensation program actually adopted will depend on the judgment of the members of the compensation committee and may differ from that set forth in the following discussion.
We anticipate that compensation for our executive officers will have three primary components: base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus and long-term incentive-based compensation in the form of stock-based awards. We anticipate that decisions regarding executive compensation will reflect our belief that the executive compensation program must be competitive in order to attract and retain our executive officers. We anticipate that the compensation committee will develop formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between long-term and currently paid compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of compensation.
Base Salary
Effective as of the closing of the Business Combination, the Board approved annual base salaries of $500,000 for Mr. Herz and $350,000 for Mr. Brotman. Upon his appointment as the Company's Chief Accounting Officer, Mr. Pilatzke's annual base salary was set at $225,000. We expect that these base salaries will be reviewed annually by the compensation committee based upon advice and counsel of its advisors.
Annual Bonuses
We expect that the Company will use annual cash incentive bonuses for the executive officers to tie a portion of their compensation to financial and operational objectives achievable within the applicable fiscal year. We expect that, near the beginning of each year, the compensation committee will select the performance targets, target amounts, target award opportunities and other terms and conditions of annual cash bonuses for the executive officers. Following the end of each year, the compensation committee will determine the extent to which the performance targets were achieved and the amount of the award that is payable to the executive officers.
Stock-Based Awards
We expect the Company to use stock-based awards to reward long-term performance of the executive officers. The Company believes that stock-based awards align the incentives of its executive officers with the interests of its stockholders and served to motivate and retain the individual executive officers. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Board and the Company's stockholders adopted the Falcon Minerals Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan and material terms thereunder (the "Incentive Plan"). The purpose of the Incentive Plan is to further align the interests of eligible participants with those of the Company's stockholders post-Business Combination by providing long-term incentive compensation opportunities tied to the performance of the Company and its common stock. The Incentive Plan is intended to advance the interests of the Company and increase stockholder value by attracting, retaining and motivating key personnel through the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and/or other stock-based awards consistent with the terms of the Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, an aggregate of 8,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock has been reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan.
Other Compensation
We expect the Company to continue to maintain various employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, life insurance and 401(k) plans, in which the executive officers will participate. We also expect the Company to provide its executive officers long-term disability insurance subject to the compensation committee's ongoing review.
Director Compensation
Effective as of the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company adopted a director compensation program under which each director who is not an employee of the Company or a subsidiary and is not affiliated with Blackstone will receive the following amounts for their services on our Board:
• Annual Chairman and Vice Chairman fee of $250,000, payable in cash; and
• An annual director fee of $100,000, payable in cash, and an equity grant in respect of Class A Common Stock having a grant date fair market value equal to $50,000. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
Founder Shares
In June 2016, we issued an aggregate of 125,000 founder shares to our Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. We received payment for the founder shares in March 2017. In March 2017, we effectuated a 57.5-for-1 stock split resulting in an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares outstanding and held by our Sponsor. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the 57.5-for-1 stock split. The founder shares automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock upon the consummation of the Business Combination on a one-for-one basis.
The founder shares included an aggregate of up to 937,500 shares subject to forfeiture by the initial stockholder to the extent that the underwriters' over-allotment was not exercised in full or in part, so that the initial stockholder would own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after the initial public offering. As a result of the underwriters' election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on August 9, 2017, 625,000 founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The underwriters elected not to exercise the remaining portion of the over-allotment option, therefore 312,500 founder shares were forfeited resulting in an aggregate of 6,875,000 founder shares outstanding and held by our Sponsor. On September 17, 2018, our Sponsor distributed the founder shares and private placement warrants held by it to its members. Our Sponsor was collectively owned by our officers and directors and Atlas Energy Group, LLC. Messrs. E. Cohen and J. Cohen are employed by Atlas Energy Group, LLC.
The Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founder shares until the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of the Business Combination, or (ii) the date on which the last sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing 150 days after the Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash, securities or other property.
Private Placement
Simultaneously with the initial public offering, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,000,000 private placement warrants at $1.00 per private placement warrant for an aggregate purchase price of $7,000,000. On August 9, 2017, we consummated the sale of an additional 500,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, which were purchased by our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $500,000. Each private placement warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The proceeds from the private placement warrants were added to the proceeds from the initial public offering held in the trust account. The private placement warrants (including the Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) could not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by it until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination.
Promissory Note – Related Party
Prior to the closing of the initial public offering, our Sponsor loaned us a total of $168,843 under a promissory note to be used for the payment of costs related to the initial public offering. The promissory note was non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of December 31, 2017 or the closing of the initial public offering. The promissory note was repaid upon the consummation of the initial public offering.
Atlas Energy Group, LLC
Atlas Energy Group, LLC, of which Messrs. E. Cohen and J. Cohen are also directors and officers of, and its affiliates provided us with advisory services in connection with potential business opportunities and prospective targets through the date of the closing of the Business Combination. For the year ended December 31 2017, we have not incurred any expenses in connection with such services.
Registration Rights
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on July 20, 2017, the holders of the founder shares and the private placement warrants (and their underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders will  be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the Business Combination and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Conflicts of Interest
Our Sponsor, officers and directors may become involved with subsequent special purpose acquisition companies similar to our Company. Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:
• None of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.
• In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
• Our Sponsor was collectively owned by our current officers and directors and Atlas Energy Group, LLC. Messrs. E. Cohen, and J. Cohen are employed by Atlas Energy Group, LLC, which we refer to as Atlas. Atlas is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to a business combination transaction.
• With certain limited exceptions, the founder shares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our Sponsor until the earlier of: (i) one year after the completion of the Business Combination; and (ii) the date on which we consummate a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange, reorganization, or other similar transaction that results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Business Combination, the founder shares will be released from the lock-up. Due to the affiliation of our officers and certain of our directors with our Sponsor, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate a business combination.
• Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether to proceed with a particular business combination.
• Our key personnel may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such key personnel was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to such business combination.
The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.
In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
• the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;
• the opportunity is within the corporation's line of business; and
• it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation. We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete a business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that such a business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
PIPE Investment
In connection with its entry into the Contribution Agreement, the Company entered into Subscription Agreements, each dated as of June 3, 2018 (the "Subscription Agreements"), with certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors (the "Investors"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of 11,480,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Investors for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, and aggregate consideration of $114,800,000 (the "Private Placement"). The Private Placement was consummated concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination and the proceeds of the Private Placement were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the Contributors. Messrs. E. Cohen, J. Cohen, Brotman and Jones participated in the Private Placement and executed Subscription Agreements to purchase, in the aggregate, 1,555,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share on the terms set forth in the Subscription Agreements.
Issuances Related to the Business Combination
In connection and concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company issued 40,000,000 shares of Class C Common Stock to the Contributors and 6,875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to our Sponsor upon conversion of the shares of Class B Common Stock held by our Sponsor in accordance with the terms of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation. On September 17, 2018, our Sponsor distributed the shares of Class A Common Stock held by it to its members.
The Business Combination
Lockup Agreement
On June 3, 2018, the Investors in the Private Placement that held shares of Class A Common Stock as of the date of the Subscription Agreement, representing approximately 7.5 million shares of Class A Common Stock purchased in the initial public offering, each executed a Lockup Agreement pursuant to which they agreed to refrain from transferring, selling or otherwise disposing of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by them as of the date of the Lockup Agreement until the earlier of the closing of the Business Combination and the termination of the Contribution Agreement, and to waive their redemption rights with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the Business Combination.
Voting Agreement
Royal, our Sponsor and certain other persons named therein are party to a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant to which such parties agreed to, among other things, vote all shares of common stock it beneficially owns or acquires prior to the closing of the Business Combination in favor of the proposals approving the Business Combination and the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement. The Voting Agreement also provides that the parties thereto will refrain from disposing, encumbering, redeeming or converting its voting shares of the Company and refrain from soliciting, negotiating or entering into any agreement with any person relating to a potential business combination involving the Company. The Voting Agreement terminated upon the date of the closing of the Business Combination.
Shareholders Agreement
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company, our Sponsor, Royal, the Contributors and Blackstone Management Partners, L.L.C. ("Blackstone") entered into a shareholders agreement (the "Shareholders Agreement"). Under the Shareholders Agreement, the parties thereto agreed to use reasonable best efforts, and the Company agreed to take all permissible actions necessary, to carry out the restructuring of the Board pursuant to the Contribution Agreement so that effective  immediately following the closing of the Business Combination, the Board is comprised of eleven (11) directors, divided into three classes of directors, in accordance with the terms of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, consisting of (a) six (6) directors to be designated by Blackstone, (b) two (2) directors to be designated by our Sponsor, and (c) three (3) independent directors to be mutually selected by the parties to the Contribution Agreement.
The Shareholders Agreement provides that directors designated by our Sponsor will serve in the class of directors whose term expires at the third annual stockholders' meeting following the closing of the Business Combination, and during such term, our Sponsor or its successor is entitled to name a replacement director in the event either of its Board designees ceases to be on the Board. The Shareholders Agreement also provides that Blackstone is entitled to designate for nomination by the Company for election (i) six (6) directors to serve on the Board so long as Blackstone and its controlled affiliates hold more than 40% of the voting power of the Company, with three (3) independent directors also serving on the Board, (ii) four (4) directors so long as Blackstone and its controlled affiliates hold between 20% and 40% of the voting power of the Company, with five (5) independent directors also serving on the Board, (iii) two (2) directors so long as Blackstone and its controlled affiliates hold between 10% and 20% of the voting power of the Company, with five (5) independent directors also serving on the Board and (iv) one (1) director so long Blackstone and its controlled affiliates hold between 5% and 10% of the voting power of the Company, with five (5) independent directors also serving on the Board. Once Blackstone and its controlled affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate less than 5% voting power of the Company, it will no longer have any rights to designate any individuals for nomination to be elected to the Board under the Shareholders Agreement.
During the term of the Shareholders Agreement, the size of the Board will be fixed based on the number of individuals Blackstone is entitled to designate for nomination to be elected as directors and the number of independent directors then serving on the Board, as described above, plus the two (2) directors designated by our Sponsor until the third annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company following the closing of the Business Combination.
The Shareholders Agreement will terminate upon the later of (x) such time Blackstone is no longer entitled to designate a director for nomination to the Board and (y) following the third annual meeting of stockholders of the Company following the closing of the Business Combination.
Registration Rights Agreement
Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on the closing date of the Business Combination, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Royal Registration Rights Agreement") with Royal and the Contributors, pursuant to which the Company has certain obligations to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), all or any portion of the Class A Common Stock that Royal and the Contributors hold as of the date of the Royal Registration Rights Agreement and that they may acquire thereafter, including upon the exchange or redemption of any other security therefor. Royal and the Contributors are entitled to an unlimited number of underwritten offerings, provided that the gross proceeds of each underwritten offering is more than $30 million, and "piggyback" registration rights. SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of any publicly traded class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of equity securities of the Company with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater-than-ten-percent stockholders are required by the SEC's regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and Forms 4 furnished to the Company during the most recent fiscal year, and Forms 5 with respect to its most recent fiscal year, we believe that all such forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely filed by the officers, directors, and security holders required to file the same during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 except for one transaction that was not reported on a timely basis by our Sponsor to report its required forfeiture of certain founder shares.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
The Company did not have an equity compensation plan at December 31, 2017. HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions:
• if the shares are registered in the name of the stockholder, the stockholder should contact us at our offices at 1845 Walnut Street, 10th Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, or (215) 832-4161, to inform us of his or her request; or
• if a bank, broker or other nominee holds the shares, the stockholder should contact the bank, broker or other nominee directly. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS
Under rules promulgated by the SEC and in accordance with our bylaws, nominations of individuals for election to the board and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders by any stockholder of the Company who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and who has complied with the other applicable requirements in our bylaws. For any nomination or other business to be properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to our corporate secretary and any such other business must otherwise be a proper matter for action by the stockholders. To be timely for our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice must set forth all information required under our bylaws and must be received by our corporate secretary at our principal executive office not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the anniversary date of our 2018 annual meeting. However, that in the event that our 2019 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of our 2018 annual meeting, to be timely a stockholder's notice must be received by our corporate secretary at our principal executive office not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the 2019 annual meeting and not later than (1) the close of business on the 90th day before the 2019 annual meeting or (2) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2019 annual meeting is first made by the Company.
In addition to our bylaws, a stockholder must also comply with all applicable requirements of state law, the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. Our bylaw provisions do not affect the right of a stockholder to request inclusion of a proposal in, or our right to omit a proposal from, our proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act.
A stockholder who wishes to submit recommendations for director candidates to the Company should send a written recommendation to our corporate secretary. Each nomination must be made in accordance with our bylaws. The stockholder must represent that the stockholder is a stockholder of our Company and the stockholder will remain so through the date of the relevant meeting of stockholders of and, if the stockholder is not a record owner of shares of common stock, provide such information about the record owner as we may request. The recommendation must also include the written consent of the person so recommended, or the recommended person, to serve as a director if nominated and elected. The stockholder and the recommended person must also provide such additional information as we may request, including any information requested concerning their respective backgrounds and relationships with one another and our Company and concerning the qualifications of the recommended person.
