NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING IN LIEU OF THE
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD JANUARY 28, 2019
To the Stockholders of Pensare Acquisition Corp.:
You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting in lieu of the 2019 annual meeting (the "special meeting") of stockholders of Pensare Acquisition Corp. ("Pensare," "Company," "we," "us" or "our") to be held on January 28, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, located at the MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166 to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
Each of the Charter Amendment, Director Proposal and Auditor Proposal are more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement.
The purpose of the Charter Amendment is to allow Pensare more time to complete an initial business combination. Pensare's initial public offering ("IPO") prospectus and charter provide that Pensare has until February 1, 2019 to complete a business combination. While we are currently in discussions with respect to several business combination opportunities, the Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before February 1, 2019 to complete a business combination. Accordingly, our board believes that in order to be able to consummate an initial business combination, we will need to obtain the Extension. Therefore, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to extend the date that Pensare has to consummate a business combination to the Extended Date in order that our stockholders have the opportunity to participate in this investment. In the event that Pensare enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the special meeting, Pensare will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
Holders ("public stockholders") of shares of Pensare's common stock sold in the IPO ("public shares") may elect to redeem their shares for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account in connection with the Charter Amendment (the "Election") regardless of whether such public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment and an Election can also be made by public stockholders who do not vote, or do not instruct their broker or bank how to vote, at the special meeting. Public stockholders may make an Election regardless of whether such public stockholders were holders as of the record date. Pensare believes that such redemption right protects Pensare's public stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if Pensare fails to find a suitable acquisition in the timeframe initially contemplated by its charter. In addition, regardless of whether public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment, or do not vote, or do not instruct their broker or bank how to vote, at the special meeting, if the Charter Amendment is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders (and not abandoned), the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their public shares for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account upon consummation of a business combination. To exercise your redemption rights, you must tender your shares to the Company's transfer agent at least two business days prior to the special meeting. You may tender your shares by either delivering your share certificate to the transfer agent or by delivering your shares electronically using the Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system. If you hold your shares in street name, you will need to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to withdraw the shares from your account in order to exercise your redemption rights.
Pensare estimates that the per-share pro rata portion of the trust account will be approximately $10.12 at the time of the special meeting. The closing price of Pensare's common stock on January 7, 2019 was $10.12. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the special meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving the same amount for each share as if such stockholder sold the shares in the open market. Pensare cannot assure stockholders that they will be able to sell their shares of Pensare common stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares.
If the Charter Amendment is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by February 1, 2019, as contemplated by our IPO prospectus and in accordance with our charter, or if the Charter Amendments approved and we do not file such amendment to our charter, we will cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares with the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account.
The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to approve the Charter Amendment, a plurality of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required for the re-election of each of the directors in the Director Proposal and the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required to approve the Auditor Proposal.
The Board has fixed the close of business on December 26, 2018 as the date for determining Pensare stockholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the special meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of Pensare common stock on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the special meeting or any adjournment thereof.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Charter Amendment, Director Proposal and Auditor Proposal are fair to and in the best interests of Pensare and its stockholders, has declared them advisable and recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote "FOR" them.
Under Delaware law and Pensare's bylaws, no other business may be transacted at the special meeting.
Enclosed is the proxy statement containing detailed information concerning the Charter Amendment, Director Proposal, Auditor Proposal and the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you to read this material carefully and vote your shares.
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
Dated: January 8, 2019

 Your vote is important. Please sign, date and return your proxy card as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may also cast your vote in person at the special meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct your broker or bank how to vote your shares, or you may cast your vote in person at the special meeting by obtaining a proxy from your brokerage firm or bank. Your failure to vote or instruct your broker or bank how to vote will have the same effect as voting against each of the proposals.

SPECIAL MEETING IN LIEU OF
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD JANUARY 28, 2019
PROXY STATEMENT
The special meeting in lieu of the 2019 annual meeting (the "special meeting") of stockholders of Pensare Acquisition Corp. ("Pensare," "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), a Delaware corporation, will be held on January 28, 2019 at 11:00 a.m, local time, at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, located at the MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166 to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
The Charter Amendment is essential to the overall implementation of the Board's plan to extend the date that Pensare has to complete a business combination. The purpose of the Charter Amendment is to allow Pensare more time to complete an initial business combination. In the event that Pensare enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the special meeting, Pensare will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to approve the Charter Amendment, a plurality of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required for the re-election of each of the directors in the Director Proposal and the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required to approve the Auditor Proposal.
Holders ("public stockholders") of shares of Pensare's common stock ("public shares") sold in Pensare's initial public offering ("IPO") may elect to redeem their shares for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account in connection with the Charter Amendment (the "Election") regardless of whether such public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment and an Election can also be made by public stockholders who do not vote, or do not instruct their broker or bank how to vote, at the special meeting. Public stockholders may make an Election regardless of whether such public stockholders were holders as of the record date. However, the Company will not proceed with the Charter Amendment if the redemption of public shares in connection therewith would cause the Company to have net tangible assets of less than $5,000,001. In addition, regardless of whether public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment, or do not vote, or do not instruct their broker or bank how to vote, at the special meeting, if the Charter Amendment is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders (and not abandoned), the remaining public stockholders will retain their right to redeem their public shares for their pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account upon consummation of the business combination when it is submitted to the stockholders. The withdrawal of funds from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the trust account following the redemption, and the amount remaining in the trust account may be significantly reduced from the approximately $314.1 million that was in the trust account as of September 30, 2018. In such event, Pensare may need to obtain additional funds to complete a business combination and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties or at all.
If the Charter Amendment is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by February 1, 2019, as contemplated by our IPO prospectus and in accordance with our charter, or if the Charter Amendment is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by February 1, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Prior to the IPO, Pensare's initial stockholders waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, which were acquired by them prior to the IPO (the "founder shares"). As a consequence of such waivers, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the public shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to Pensare's rights and warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we wind up.
To protect amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by our sponsor specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor's only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
Approval of the Charter Amendment proposal will constitute consent for Pensare to instruct the trustee to (i) remove from the trust account an amount (the "Withdrawal Amount") equal to the pro rata portion of funds available in the trust account relating to the redeemed public shares and (ii) deliver to the holders of such redeemed public shares their pro rata portion of the Withdrawal Amount. The remainder of such funds shall remain in the trust account and be available for use by Pensare to complete a business combination on or before the Extended Date. Holders of public shares who do not redeem their public shares now, will retain their redemption rights and their ability to vote on a business combination through the Extended Date if the Charter Amendment is approved.
The record date for the special meeting is December 26, 2018. Record holders of Pensare common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to vote or have their votes cast at the special meeting. On the record date, there were 38,812,500 outstanding shares of Pensare common stock. Pensare's warrants do not have voting rights.
This proxy statement contains important information about the special meeting and the proposals. Please read it carefully and vote your shares.
This proxy statement is dated January 8, 2019 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about that date. TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q.           Why am I receiving this proxy statement?  A.          This          proxy statement         and the accompanying materials are being sent to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies          by the Board, for use at the         special meeting in lieu of the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders to be held on Monday,          January 28, 2019 at 11:00 a.m.,         local time, at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, located         at          the MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York         10166, or at any adjournments or postponements          thereof. This proxy statement summarizes the information that you need to make an         informed decision on the proposals          to be considered at the special meeting.   Pensare is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering          into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination          with one or more businesses or entities. In August 2017, Pensare consummated its IPO from which it derived gross proceeds of $310.5          million, including proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. Like most blank check companies,          our charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of shares of common stock sold in the IPO          if no qualifying business combinations are consummated on or before a certain date (in our case, February 1, 2019). The Board believes          that it is in the best interests of the stockholders to continue Pensare's existence until the Extended Date in order to          allow Pensare more time to complete such business combination and is submitting this proposal to the stockholders to vote upon.          In addition, we are proposing the re-election of four directors to the Board and the ratification of the selection by our Audit          Committee of Marcum LLP (''Marcum") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting          firm for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.

  The Charter Amendment proposal is essential to the overall implementation          of the Board's plan to extend the date that Pensare has to complete a business combination. In the event that Pensare enters          into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the special meeting, Pensare will issue a press release and file          a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination. Approval of the Charter Amendment          is a condition to the implementation of the Extension.   If the Extension is implemented, the stockholders' approval          of the Charter Amendment proposal will constitute consent for Pensare to remove the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account, deliver          to the holders of such redeemed public shares their pro rata portion of the Withdrawal Amount and retain the remainder of          the funds in the trust account for Pensare's use in connection with consummating a business combination on or before the          Extended Date.   We will not proceed if we do not have at least $5,000,001 of          net tangible assets following approval of the Charter Amendment proposal, after taking into account the Election.   If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved and the Extension          is implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount          held in the trust account following the Election. Pensare cannot predict the amount that will remain in the trust account if the          Charter Amendment proposal is approved; and the amount remaining in the trust account may be significantly reduced from the approximately          $314.1 million that was in the trust account as of September 30, 2018. In such event, Pensare may need to obtain additional funds          to complete a business combination and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties          or at all.   If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved and we have          not consummated a business combination by February 1, 2019, or if the Charter Amendment proposal is approved and we have not consummated          a business combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly          as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share          price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the          funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption          will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation          distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject          to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above)          to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.   Pensare's initial stockholders have waived their  rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from  the trust account with respect to our rights and warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay  the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account.

If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved and the Extension          is implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount          held in the trust account following the Election. Pensare cannot predict the amount that will remain in the trust account if the          Charter Amendment proposal is approved; and the amount remaining in the trust account may be significantly reduced from the approximately          $314.1 million that was in the trust account as of September 30, 2018. In such event, Pensare may need to obtain additional funds          to complete a business combination and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties          or at all.   If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved and we have          not consummated a business combination by February 1, 2019, or if the Charter Amendment proposal is approved and we have not consummated          a business combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly          as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share          price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the          funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption          will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation          distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject          to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above)          to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.   Pensare's initial stockholders have waived their  rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from  the trust account with respect to our rights and warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay  the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account. 
  The Charter Amendment proposal is essential to the overall implementation          of the Board's plan to extend the date that Pensare has to complete a business combination. In the event that Pensare enters          into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the special meeting, Pensare will issue a press release and file          a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.

Q.           Why is the Company proposing the Charter Amendment proposal?  A.          Pensare's          charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of shares of common stock sold in the IPO if no          qualifying business combinations are consummated on or before February 1, 2019. Accordingly, the trust agreement provides for the          trustee to liquidate the trust account and distribute to each public stockholder its pro rata share of such funds if a qualifying          business combination is not consummated on or before such date provided in Pensare's charter. As we explain below, Pensare          may not be able to complete a business combination by that date.   While Pensare is currently in discussions with respect to several          business combination opportunities, Pensare has not yet executed a definitive agreement for a business combination. Pensare currently          anticipates entering into such an agreement with one of its prospective targets, but Pensare does not expect to be able to consummate          such a business combination by February 1, 2019.   Because Pensare will not be able to conclude a business combination          within the permitted time period, Pensare has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which Pensare has to          complete a business combination.   Pensare believes that given Pensare's expenditure of time,          effort and money on finding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider          a business combination. Accordingly, the Board is proposing the Charter Amendment to extend Pensare's corporate existence.   You are not being asked to vote on a business combination          at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote          on any proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for a pro          rata portion of the trust account in the event such business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated          a business combination by the Extended Date.

Pensare currently          anticipates entering into such an agreement with one of its prospective targets, but Pensare does not expect to be able to consummate          such a business combination by February 1, 2019.   Because Pensare will not be able to conclude a business combination          within the permitted time period, Pensare has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which Pensare has to          complete a business combination.   Pensare believes that given Pensare's expenditure of time,          effort and money on finding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider          a business combination. Accordingly, the Board is proposing the Charter Amendment to extend Pensare's corporate existence.   You are not being asked to vote on a business combination          at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote          on any proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for a pro          rata portion of the trust account in the event such business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated          a business combination by the Extended Date.   
Q.           Why should I vote for the Charter Amendment?  A.          The Board believes          stockholders should have an opportunity to evaluate an initial business combination with one or more of the targets with which          Pensare is in discussions. Accordingly, the Board is proposing the Charter Amendment to extend the date by which Pensare has to          complete a business combination until the Extended Date and to allow for the Election.   The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority  of all then outstanding shares of common stock is required to effect an amendment to Pensare's Charter, including any amendment  that would extend its corporate existence beyond February 1, 2019. Additionally, Pensare's charter requires that all public  stockholders have an opportunity to redeem their public shares in the case Pensare's corporate existence is extended. We  believe that this charter provision was included to protect Pensare stockholders from having to sustain their investments for  an unreasonably long period if Pensare failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter.  We also believe, however, that given Pensare's expenditure of time, effort and money on the potential business combinations  with the targets it has identified, circumstances warrant providing those who would like to consider whether a potential business  combination with one or more of such targets is an attractive investment with an opportunity to consider such transaction, inasmuch  as Pensare is also affording stockholders who wish to redeem their public shares the opportunity to do so, as required under its  charter. Accordingly, we believe the Extension is consistent with Pensare's charter and IPO prospectus.

Q.           What happens if the Charter Amendment is not approved?  A.          If the Charter Amendment          is not approved and we have not consummated a business combination by February 1, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except          for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100%          of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust          account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number          of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders          (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as          reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and          liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors          and the requirements of other applicable law.   Pensare's initial stockholders waived their rights to          participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from the trust          account with respect to our rights and warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay the costs          of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account, which it believes are sufficient for such purposes.

If Pensare executes such an agreement, we will seek to complete          the business combination, which will involve:● completing proxy          materials;● establishing a          meeting date and record date for considering a proposed business combination and distributing proxy materials to stockholders;          and● holding a special          meeting to consider such proposed business combination.

If Pensare executes such an agreement, we will seek to complete          the business combination, which will involve:● completing proxy          materials;● establishing a          meeting date and record date for considering a proposed business combination and distributing proxy materials to stockholders;          and● holding a special          meeting to consider such proposed business combination.   Pensare is seeking approval of the Charter Amendment  because Pensare will not be able to complete all of the above listed tasks prior to February 1, 2019.

  Upon approval by holders of at least a majority of the common          stock outstanding as of the record date of the Charter proposal, Pensare will file an amendment to the charter with the Secretary          of State of the State of Delaware in the form of Annex A hereto. Pensare will remain a reporting company under the Securities          Exchange Act of 1934 and its units, common stock, rights and warrants will remain publicly traded.   If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, the removal of          the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account will reduce the amount remaining in the trust account and increase the percentage          interest of Pensare's common stock held by Pensare's directors and officers through the founder shares.   If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, but Pensare does          not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding          up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public          shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any          interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding          public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right          to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible          following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject          (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements          of other applicable law.   Pensare's initial stockholders waived their rights to          participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from the trust          account with respect to our rights and warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay the costs          of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account, which it believes are sufficient for such purposes.

Q.           How are votes counted?  A.          Votes will be counted          by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately count "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes,          abstentions and broker non-votes. The Charter Amendment proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority          of the outstanding shares as of the record date of Pensare's common stock. Each of the nominees named in the Director Proposal          must receive a plurality of the shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting for each nominee. The          Auditor Proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock present (in person          or by proxy) at the special meeting and voting on such proposal.   With respect to the Charter Amendment proposal, abstentions          and broker non-votes will have the same effect as "AGAINST" votes. If your shares are held by your broker as your nominee          (that is, in "street name"), you may need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds your shares and follow          the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If you do not give instructions          to your broker, your broker can vote your shares with respect to "discretionary" items, but not with respect to "non-discretionary"          items. Discretionary items are proposals considered routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to member          brokerage firms. These rules provide that for routine matters your broker has the discretion to vote shares held in street name          in the absence of your voting instructions. On non-discretionary items for which you do not give your broker instructions, the          shares will be treated as broker non-votes.

Q.           What is a quorum requirement?  A.          A quorum of stockholders          is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present with regard to each of the Charter Amendment proposal, Director          Proposal and Auditor Proposal if at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock on the record date are represented          by stockholders present at the meeting or by proxy.

Q.           How do I redeem my shares of Pensare common stock?  A.          If the Extension          is implemented, each public stockholder may seek to redeem such stockholder's public shares for its pro rata portion          of the funds available in the trust account, less any income taxes owed on such funds but not yet paid. You will also be able to          redeem your public shares in connection with any stockholder vote to approve a proposed business combination, or if the Company          has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.   In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you          must elect either to physically tender your share certificates to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's          transfer agent, at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, One State Street, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004-1561,          Attn: Mark Zimkind, mzimkind@continentalstock.com, at least two business days prior to the special meeting or to deliver your shares          to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System,          which election would likely be determined based on the manner in which you hold your shares.   Certificates that have not been tendered in accordance  with these procedures at least two business days prior to the special meeting will not be redeemed for cash. In the event that  a public shareholder tenders its shares and decides prior to the special meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the  shareholder may withdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the  special meeting not to redeem your shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically).  You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed above.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This proxy statement and the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement contain "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which we refer to as the Act, and the federal securities laws. Any statements that do not relate to historical or current facts or matters are forward-looking statements. You can identify some of the forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as "anticipate," "believe," "plan," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "should," "may" and other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. There can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations. Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our ability to consummate a business combination, and any other statements that are not statements of current or historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on information available to the Company as of the date of the proxy materials and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any subsequent date and the Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made.
These forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:
You should carefully consider these risks, in addition to the risk factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC, including the final prospectus related to our IPO dated July 27, 2017 (Registration Nos. 333-219162 and 333-219518) and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The documents we file with the SEC, including those referred to above, also discuss some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ from those contained or implied in the forward-looking statements. See "Where You Can Find More Information" for additional information about our filings.  
BACKGROUND
Pensare
We are a Delaware company incorporated on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
On August 1, 2017, we consummated our IPO of 27,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one right and one-half of one warrant. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, as described in more detail in the IPO prospectus. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50. On August 4, 2017, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional 4,050,000 units. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $310,500,000.
The units began trading on July 28, 2017 on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol "WRLSU." Commencing on August 8, 2014, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, rights and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbols "WRLSU," "WRLS," "WRLSR" and "WRLSW," respectively.
Prior to our IPO, our sponsor and certain other persons purchased an aggregate of 7,187,500 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.0035 per share. In June 2017, our sponsor transferred 1,575,000 founder shares to MasTec, Inc. ("MasTec") for the same purchase price originally paid for such shares. In July 2017, we effected a stock dividend with respect to our common stock of 575,000 shares thereof, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 7,762,500 founder shares. Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO and the over-allotment, our sponsor, MasTec and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. ("EBC") purchased an aggregate of 10,512,500 warrants (the "private placement warrants") for $10,512,500. The net proceeds of the IPO plus the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants were deposited in the trust account. As of September 30, 2018, Pensare had approximately $314.1 million in the trust account.
The mailing address of Pensare's principal executive office is Pensare Acquisition Corp., 1720 Peachtree Street, Suite 629, Atlanta, GA 30309, and its telephone number is (404) 234-3098.
The Potential Business Combination
Pensare is currently in discussions with multiple targets to complete a business combination that would qualify as an initial business combination under its charter. In the event that Pensare enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the special meeting, Pensare will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
You are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on any proposed business combination if and when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event such business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
The Special Meeting
Date, Time and Place. The special meeting in lieu of the 2019 annual meeting of Pensare's stockholders will be held on January 28, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, located at the MetLife Building, 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10166. Voting Power; Record Date. You will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the special meeting, if you owned shares of Pensare's common stock at the close of business on December 26, 2018, the record date for the special meeting. You will have one vote per proposal for each share you owned at that time. Pensare's rights and warrants do not carry voting rights.
Votes Required. The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required to approve the Charter Amendment, a plurality of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required for the re-election of each of the directors in the Director Proposal and the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of common stock voted at the meeting is required to approve the Auditor Proposal. If you do not vote (i.e., you "abstain" from voting on a proposal), your action will have the effect of a vote against the Charter Amendment and no effect on either the Director Proposal and Auditor Proposal. Likewise, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the Charter Amendment and no effect on either of the Director Proposal and Auditor Proposal.
At the close of business on the record date, there were 38,812,500 outstanding shares of common stock, including 31,050,000 public shares, each of which entitles its holder to cast one vote per proposal.
If you do not want the Charter Amendment approved, you should vote against the proposal or abstain from voting on the proposal. If you want to obtain your pro rata portion of the trust account in the event the Extension is implemented, which will be paid shortly after the special meeting scheduled for January 28, 2019, you must demand redemption of your shares. Holders of public shares may redeem their public shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the Charter Amendment or abstain.
Proxies; Board Solicitation. Your proxy is being solicited by the Board on the proposals being presented to stockholders at the special meeting to approve the Charter Amendment, Director Proposal and Auditor Proposal. No recommendation is being made as to whether you should elect to redeem your shares. Proxies may be solicited in person or by telephone. If you grant a proxy, you may still revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person at the special meeting.
Pensare has retained Morrow Sodali LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies. Morrow Sodali LLC will receive a fee of approximately $30,000, as well as reimbursement for certain costs and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with their services, all of which will be paid by Pensare. In addition, officers and directors of Pensare may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile, and personal interview, for which no additional compensation will be paid, though they may be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. Pensare will bear the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the enclosed form of proxy, this proxy statement and other material which may be sent to stockholders in connection with this solicitation. Pensare may reimburse brokerage firms and other nominee holders for their reasonable expenses in sending proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of our shares. THE CHARTER AMENDMENT PROPOSAL
Charter Amendment Proposal
Pensare is proposing to amend its charter to extend the date by which Pensare has to consummate a business combination from February 1, 2019 to the Extended Date.
The Charter Amendment is essential to the overall implementation of the Board's plan to allow Pensare more time to complete a business combination. Approval of the Charter Amendment is a condition to the implementation of the Extension.
If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved and we have not consummated a business combination by February 1, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up.
A copy of the proposed amendment to the charter of Pensare is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
Reasons for the Proposal
Pensare's IPO prospectus and charter provide that Pensare has until February 1, 2019 to consummate a business combination. While we are currently in discussions with respect to several business combination opportunities, the Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before February 1, 2019 to complete a business combination. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of common stock is required to extend Pensare's corporate existence, except in connection with, and effective upon consummation of, a business combination. Additionally, Pensare's IPO prospectus and charter provide for all public stockholders to have an opportunity to redeem their public shares in the case Pensare's corporate existence is extended as described above. Because Pensare continues to believe that a business combination would be in the best interests of Pensare's stockholders, and because Pensare will not be able to conclude a business combination within the permitted time period, Pensare has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which Pensare has to complete a business combination beyond February 1, 2019 to the Extended Date.
We believe that the foregoing charter provisions were included to protect Pensare stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period, if Pensare failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter. We also believe, however, that given Pensare's expenditure of time, effort and money on the potential business combinations with the targets it has identified, circumstances warrant providing those who would like to consider whether such potential business combinations are attractive investments with an opportunity to consider such transactions, inasmuch as Pensare is also affording stockholders who wish to redeem their public shares the opportunity to do so, as required under its charter. Accordingly, the Extension is consistent with Pensare's charter and IPO prospectus.
If the Charter Amendment Proposal Is Not Approved
If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved and we have not consummated a business combination by February 1, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Pensare's initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to Pensare's warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account.
If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved, the Company will not effect the Extension, and in the event the Company does not complete a business combination on or before February 1, 2019, the trust account will be liquidated and distributed to the public shareholders on a pro rata basis as described above.
If the Charter Amendment Proposal Is Approved
If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, Pensare will file an amendment to the charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in the form of Annex A hereto. Pensare will remain a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its units, common stock, rights and warrants will remain publicly traded. Pensare will then continue to work to complete a business combination by the Extended Date.
If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, but Pensare does not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Pensare's initial stockholders waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their founder shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. Pensare will pay the costs of liquidation from its remaining assets held outside of the trust account, which it believes are sufficient for such purposes.
You are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on any proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event such business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, and the Extension is implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal Amount from the trust account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the trust account and Pensare's net asset value. Pensare cannot predict the amount that will remain in the trust account if the Charter Amendment proposal is approved; and the amount remaining in the trust account may be significantly reduced from the approximately $314.1 million that was in the trust account as of September 30, 2018. However, we will not proceed if we do not have at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets following approval of the Charter Amendment proposal. Redemption Rights
If the Charter Amendment proposal is approved, the Company will provide the public stockholders making the Election, the opportunity to receive, at the time the Charter Amendment becomes effective, and in exchange for the surrender of their shares, a pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account, less any income taxes owed on such funds but not yet paid. You will also be able to redeem your public shares in connection with any stockholder vote to approve a proposed business combination, or if the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
TO DEMAND REDEMPTION, PRIOR TO 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME ON JANUARY 24, 2019 (TWO BUSINESS DAYS BEFORE THE SPECIAL MEETING), YOU SHOULD ELECT EITHER TO PHYSICALLY TENDER YOUR SHARE CERTIFICATES TO OUR TRANSFER AGENT OR TO DELIVER YOUR SHARES TO OUR TRANSFER AGENT ELECTRONICALLY USING DTC'S DWAC (DEPOSIT/WITHDRAWAL AT CUSTODIAN), AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. YOU SHOULD ENSURE THAT YOUR BANK OR BROKER COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED ELSEWHERE HEREIN.
In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, you must elect either to physically tender your stock certificates to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, One State Street, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004-1561, Attn: Mark Zimkind, mzimkind@continentalstock.com, prior to the vote for the Charter Amendment or to deliver your shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, which election would likely be determined based on the manner in which you hold your shares. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the vote at the special meeting ensures that a redeeming holder's election is irrevocable once the Charter Amendment are approved. In furtherance of such irrevocable election, stockholders making the election will not be able to tender their shares after the vote at the special meeting.
Through the DWAC system, this electronic delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in "street name," by contacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder's broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company's transfer agent will need to act together to facilitate this request. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company's understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. Such stockholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those stockholders that deliver their shares through the DWAC system. Stockholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.
Certificates that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures prior to the vote for the Charter Amendment will not be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account. In the event that a public stockholder tenders its shares and decides prior to the vote at the special meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the stockholder may withdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the vote at the special meeting not to redeem your shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed above. In the event that a public stockholder tenders shares and the Charter Amendment is not approved or is abandoned, these shares will not be redeemed and the physical certificates representing these shares will be returned to the stockholder promptly following the determination that the Charter Amendment will not be approved or will be abandoned. The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Charter Amendment would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Charter Amendment. The transfer agent will hold the certificates of public stockholders that make the election until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders. If properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account, less any income taxes owed on such funds but not yet paid, calculated as of two days prior to the filing of the amendment to the charter. As of September 30, 2018, this would amount to approximately $10.12 per share. The closing price of Pensare's common stock on January 7, 2019 was $10.12. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the special meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public stockholder receiving the same amount for each share as if such stockholder sold the shares in the open market.
If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your shares of common stock for cash and will no longer own the shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption and tender your stock certificate(s) to the Company's transfer agent at least two business days prior to the special meeting. If the Charter Amendment is not approved or if it is abandoned, these shares will be returned promptly following the special meeting as described above.
Possible Claims Against and Impairment of the Trust Account
To protect amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by our sponsor specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor's only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce such indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.
Required Vote
Approval of the Charter Amendment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least a majority of Pensare's common stock outstanding on the record date. If the Charter Amendment proposal is not approved and Pensare is unable to complete a business combination on or before February 1, 2019, it will be required by its charter to (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. All of Pensare's directors, executive officers and their affiliates are expected to vote any common stock owned by them in favor of the Charter Amendment. On the record date, directors and executive officers of Pensare and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 5,953,500 shares of common stock representing approximately 15.3% of Pensare's issued and outstanding common stock.
In addition, Pensare's directors, executive officers and their affiliates may choose to buy shares of Pensare public common stock in the open market and/or through negotiated private purchases. In the event that purchases do occur, the purchasers may seek to purchase shares from stockholders who would otherwise have voted against the Charter Amendment proposal and elected to redeem their shares for a portion of the trust account. Any shares of common stock held by affiliates will be voted in favor of the Charter Amendment proposal.
Interests of Pensare's Directors and Officers
When you consider the recommendation of the Board, you should keep in mind that Pensare's executive officers and members of the Board have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests include, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If the Charter Amendment is not approved and  we do not consummate a business combination by February 1, 2019 as contemplated by our IPO prospectus and in accordance with our  charter, the 5,953,500 shares of common stock held by Pensare officers, directors and affiliates, which were acquired prior to  the IPO for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25,000, will be worthless (as the holders have waived liquidation rights  with respect to such shares), as will the 7,017,290 warrants that were acquired simultaneously with the IPO and over-allotment  by our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $7,017,290, which will expire. Such common stock and warrants had an aggregate  market value of approximately $62,003,742.50 based on the last sale price of Pensare's common stock and warrants of $10.12  and $0.25, respectively, on Nasdaq on January 7, 2019;

 The Board's Reasons for the Charter Amendment Proposal and Its Recommendation
As discussed below, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Charter Amendment proposal is fair to, and in the best interests of, Pensare and its stockholders. The Board has approved and declared advisable adoption of the Charter Amendment proposal, and recommends that you vote "FOR" such adoption. The Board expresses no opinion as to whether you should redeem your public shares.
We are a Delaware company incorporated on April 7, 2016 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. On August 1, 2017, we consummated our IPO of 27,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, one right and one-half of one warrant. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, as described in more detail in the IPO prospectus. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50. On August 4, 2017, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional 4,050,000 units. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $310,500,000.
Pensare's IPO prospectus and charter provide that Pensare has until February 1, 2019 to consummate a business combination. While we are currently in discussions with respect to several business combination opportunities, our board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before February 1, 2019 to complete a business combination. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of common stock is required to extend Pensare's corporate existence, except in connection with, and effective upon consummation of, a business combination. Additionally, Pensare's IPO prospectus and charter provide for all public stockholders to have an opportunity to redeem their public shares in the case Pensare's corporate existence is extended as described above. Because Pensare continues to believe that a business combination would be in the best interests of Pensare's stockholders, and because Pensare will not be able to conclude a business combination within the permitted time period, Pensare has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which Pensare has to complete a business combination beyond February 1, 2019 to the Extended Date.
Pensare is not asking you to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on any proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account in the event such business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all then outstanding shares of common stock is required to effect an amendment to Pensare's charter that would extend its corporate existence beyond February 1, 2019, except in connection with, and effective upon consummation of, a business combination. Additionally, Pensare's charter requires that all public stockholders have an opportunity to redeem their public shares in the case Pensare's corporate existence is extended as described above. We believe that these charter provisions were included to protect Pensare stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period, if Pensare failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter. We also believe, however, that given Pensare's expenditure of time, effort and money on the potential business combinations with the targets it has identified, circumstances warrant providing those who would like to consider whether such potential business combinations are attractive investments with an opportunity to consider such transactions, inasmuch as Pensare is also affording stockholders who wish to redeem their public shares the opportunity to do so, as required under its charter. Accordingly, the Extension is consistent with Pensare's charter and IPO prospectus. After careful consideration of all relevant factors, Pensare's board of directors determined that the Charter Amendment is fair to and in the best interests of Pensare and its stockholders.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the Charter Amendment proposal. The Board of Directors expresses no opinion as to whether you should redeem your public shares.  THE DIRECTOR PROPOSAL
At the special meeting, shareholders are being asked to re-elect four directors to the Board to serve as the first class of directors.
Prior to our IPO, the Board was divided into two classes: the class I directors and the class II directors. The original class I directors stand elected for a term expiring at the Company's first annual meeting and the original class II directors stand elected for a term expiring at the Company's second annual meeting. Commencing at the first annual meeting, and then at each following annual meeting, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire are elected for a term of office to expire at the second annual meeting following their election. Directors whose terms expire at an annual meeting may also be re-elected for a further two-year period if nominated by the Board.
As the special meeting is in lieu of the Company's 2019 annual meeting (being the Company's first annual meeting since its IPO), the terms of the current class I directors, Dr. Klaas Baks and Messrs. U. Bertram Ellis, Karl Krapek and Dennis Lockhart, will expire at the special meeting. However, the Board has nominated each of such individuals for re-appointment as class I directors, to hold office until the second annual meeting of stockholders following this special meeting, or until his successor is elected and qualified.
Unless you indicate otherwise, shares represented by executed proxies in the form enclosed will be voted to re-elect each of Dr. Baks and Messrs. Ellis, Krapek and Lockhart unless any such individual is unavailable, in which case such shares will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. We have no reason to believe that either nominee will be unavailable or, if elected, will decline to serve.
For a biography of Dr. Baks and Messrs. Ellis, Krapek and Lockhart, please see the section entitled "Management."
Required Vote
Approval of the Director Proposal requires a plurality of the votes of Pensare's shares present (in person or by proxy) at the special meeting for each of the director nominees. You may vote for or withhold your vote for all, or any, of the nominees.
All of Pensare's directors, executive officers and their affiliates are expected to vote any shares owned by them in favor of each of the directors named in the Director Proposal. On the record date, directors and executive officers of Pensare and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote 5,953,500 shares of common stock representing approximately 15.3% of Pensare's issued and outstanding shares of common stock.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of the nominees named above. RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Designated Director
MasTec has the right to designate a director to our board of directors. MasTec's initial designee on our board of directors was Mr. Jose Mas. Prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will nominate MasTec's designee for election at each annual meeting, so long as MasTec beneficially owns not less than 25% of the founders' shares and private warrants that it owns at the time of the closing of our initial public offering. MasTec may waive its right to designate a director and instead have the right to have a board observer attend all of the meetings of our board of directors and receive all information provided to our board of directors, subject to such board observer executing an appropriate confidentiality agreement with us.
Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors
Our board of directors is divided into two classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a two-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Messrs. Ellis, Krapek and Lockhart and Dr. Baks, will expire at the special meeting. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Ms. Shank and Messrs. Mays, Mock and Mas, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders.
Our officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our amended and restated bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and such other officers (including, without limitation, Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries and a Treasurer) as may be determined by the board of directors.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a nominating committee and a compensation committee.
Audit Committee
We have an audit committee comprised of Messrs. Lockhart and Baks and Ms. Shank, each of whom is an independent director. Darren Thompson serves as the Chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Darren Thompson qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in applicable SEC rules because he meets the requirement for past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting or comparable experience. The responsibilities of our audit committee include: Nominating Committee 
Our nominating committee consists of Messrs. Lockhart and Krapek and Ms. Shank, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq's listing standards. The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee considers persons identified by its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others.
The guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in our Nominating Committee Charter, generally provide that persons to be nominated:
The nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background, integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person's candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons. Compensation Committee
Our compensation committee consists of Messrs. Ellis, Baks and Krapek, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaq's listing standards. The compensation committee's duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:
Code of Ethics and Committee Charters
We have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics, our audit committee charter, our nominating committee charter and our compensation committee charter as exhibits to our registration statement. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a current report on Form 8-K.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officer, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and ten percent stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on copies of such forms received, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, all filing requirements applicable to our officer, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were complied with.
Executive Compensation
No executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. We have entered into a Strategic Services Agreement with John Foley, our Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay Mr. Foley consulting fees of $500 per hour for any hours of consulting services provided by Mr. Foley in excess of ten hours per month. The Strategic Services Agreement has an initial term of two years commencing on the date of our final prospectus, as filed with the SEC on July 31, 2017, subject to earlier termination by either party. Mr. Foley also received a grant of profits interests in our sponsor. We are obligated to make the same payments to our Special Advisors pursuant to Strategic Services Agreements we have entered into with each of them, and each of our Special Advisors and Dr. Willis has also received a grant of profits interest in our sponsor. The profits interests in our sponsor that were granted to Dr. Willis, Mr. Foley and our Special Advisors are Class B Membership Units in our sponsor that were assigned to such individuals by Mr. Mays, who holds the remaining Class B Membership Units. The value of these profits interests, if any, will be wholly dependent on the value, following the consummation of our initial business combination, of the founders' shares and the private warrants held by our sponsor. At that time, the holders of the Class B Membership Units would be entitled to receive distributions from the sponsor, which may consist of a portion of the founders' shares and private warrants or the proceeds obtained by the sponsor upon the sale thereof, to the extent available after the holders of Class A Membership Units in the sponsor shall have received distributions equal to a multiple of their initial capital contributions in the sponsor. Accordingly, the value of the profits interests is related to our performance, because if the prices of our shares and warrants increase, the value of the profits interests will increase (assuming that the holders of Class A Membership Units have received the full amount of distributions payable to them). The profits interests (or, in the case of Dr. Willis and Mr. Panton, a portion of the profits interests) are subject to partial forfeiture if the recipient ceases providing services to us prior to the first anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination, or if the value of the distributions received by the recipient on account of such profits interests would exceed a specified value.
Commencing on July 27, 2017, through the acquisition of a target business, we will pay our sponsor an aggregate fee of up to $20,000 per month for providing us with office space and certain office and secretarial services. However, this arrangement is solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide our executive officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary.
Other than the administrative fee of up to $20,000 per month, the compensation payable to Mr. Foley pursuant to the Strategic Services Agreement described above and the repayment of any loans made by our sponsor to us, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder's, consulting fees and other similar fees, will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, they will receive repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us.
After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K, as required by the SEC.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None.
Compensation Committee Report
Our compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on that review and discussion, the compensation committee recommended to the Company's board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Karl Krapek Report of the Audit Committee*
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements with management, and has discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") in Rule 3200T. Additionally, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from our independent registered public accounting firm, as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. Based upon such review and discussion, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the last fiscal year for filing with the SEC.

The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of January 7, 2019, by:
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the sponsor warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this proxy statement.
We have based our calculation of the percentage of beneficial ownership on 38,812,500 ordinary shares outstanding on January 7, 2019.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
In May 2016, our sponsor purchased 10,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $11.00. In May 2017, our sponsor and certain other persons purchased an aggregate of 7,177,500 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $24,990 in cash, or approximately $0.0035 per share. In June 2017, our sponsor transferred 1,575,000 founder shares to MasTec for the same purchase price originally paid for such shares. In July 2017, we effected a stock dividend with respect to our common stock of 575,000 shares thereof, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 7,762,500 founder shares.
Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor, MasTec and EBC purchased from us an aggregate of 10,512,000 private warrants for a total purchase price of $10,512,500, each in a private placement. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase of one share of common stock at $11.50 per share. Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company deposited the purchase price into the Trust Account simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering. The private warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in our initial public offering except that the private warrants: (i) will not be redeemable by us and (ii) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, as described in the IPO prospectus, so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the private warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their private warrants or the common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants (except to certain permitted transferees), until after the completion of our initial business combination.
In order to meet our working capital needs, our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at holder's discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. If we do not complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven.
On June 8, 2018, our sponsor advanced us $1,000,000 for working capital purposes. The working capital loan was evidenced by a $1,000,000 promissory note, which is payable without interest upon consummation of a business combination or, at the holder's discretion, the note may be converted into warrants at a conversion price of $1.00 per warrant. Each warrant will contain terms identical private warrants, entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share as more fully described in the IPO prospectus.
We hold a commitment letter from our chief executive officer and managing member of our sponsor, whereby the managing member of our sponsor commits to funding any working capital shortfalls through the earlier of an initial business combination or our liquidation. The loans would be issued as required and each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note, up to an aggregate of $750,000. The loans will be non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination or at the holder's discretion, up to $500,000 of the loan would convert into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. If we do not complete a business combination, any such loans will be forgiven. As of September 30, 2018, we did not have any promissory notes outstanding related to this commitment.
The holders of our founder shares as well as the holders of the private warrants and any warrants our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (and all underlying securities), are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on July 27, 2017. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the founder shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the private warrants or warrants issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Our sponsor, which is affiliated with our officers and directors, has agreed that, through the earlier of our consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation, it will make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative support, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay our sponsor an aggregate of up to $20,000 per month for these services. Accordingly, our officers and directors will benefit from the transaction to the extent of their interest in our sponsor. However, this arrangement is solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Atlanta area, that the fee charged by our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
We have entered into a Strategic Services Agreement with John Foley, our Chief Financial Officer, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay Mr. Foley consulting fees of $500 per hour for any hours of consulting services provided by Mr. Foley in excess of ten hours per month. The Strategic Services Agreement has an initial term of two years commencing on July 27, 2017, subject to earlier termination by either party. Mr. Foley also received a grant of profits interests in our sponsor. We are obligated to make the same payments to our Special Advisors pursuant to Strategic Services Agreements we have entered into with each of them, and each of our Special Advisors and Dr. Willis has also received a grant of profits interest in our sponsor.
Other than the administrative fee of up to $20,000 per month and the compensation payable to Mr. Foley pursuant to the Strategic Services Agreement, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder's, consulting fees and other similar fees, will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive the repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us.
After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K, as required by the SEC.
All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by a majority of our uninterested "independent" directors or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our disinterested "independent" directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.
Related Party Policy
Our Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position. Our audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors' and officers' questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.
To further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our sponsor, officers or directors including (i) an entity that is either a portfolio company of, or has otherwise received a material financial investment from, any private equity fund or investment company (or an affiliate thereof) that is affiliated with any of the foregoing, (ii) an entity in which any of the foregoing or their affiliates are currently passive investors, (iii) an entity in which any of the foregoing or their affiliates are currently officers or directors, or (iv) an entity in which any of the foregoing or their affiliates are currently invested through an investment vehicle controlled by them, unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, and the approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.
Director Independence
Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An "independent director" is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Mock, Ellis, Krapek, Lockhart, Baks and Ms. Shank are "independent directors" as defined in the Nasdaq listing. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
If the Charter Amendment is approved, we anticipate that the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will be held no later than December 31, 2020. For any proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for submission to the stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, it must be submitted in writing and comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.
In addition, our bylaws provide notice procedures for stockholders to nominate a person as a director and to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. Notice of a nomination or proposal must be delivered to us not less than 90 days and not more than 120 days prior to the date for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received no earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by us. Nominations and proposals also must satisfy other requirements set forth in the bylaws. The Chairman of the Board may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder proposal not made in compliance with the foregoing procedures.
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO STOCKHOLDERS
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address in the future, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions:
WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION
We file annual and quarterly reports and other reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and other information can be inspected and copied at, and copies of these materials can be obtained at prescribed rates from, the Public Reference Section of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. We distribute to our stockholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and, upon request, quarterly reports for the first three quarters of each fiscal year containing unaudited financial information. In addition, the reports and other information are filed through Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (known as "EDGAR") system and are publicly available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website, located at http://www.sec.gov. We will provide without charge to you, upon written or oral request, a copy of the reports and other information filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Any requests for copies of information, reports or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be directed to Pensare Acquisition Corp., 1720 Peachtree Street, Suite 629, Atlanta, GA 30309, Attention: Darrell J. Mays, Chief Executive Officer.
In order to receive timely delivery of the documents in advance of the special meeting, you must make your request for information no later than January 16, 2019. ANNEX A
