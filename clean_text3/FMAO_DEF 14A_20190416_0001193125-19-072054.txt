Your Vote Is Important 
If you hold stock directly in your own name: Even if you plan to attend the meeting, please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed envelope or follow the voting instructions for internet or telephone voting enclosed if you are a shareholder of record. 
If you hold stock in a brokerage account, IRA, 401(k) plan, or trust account: With respect to a limited number of proposals, your broker or bank is permitted to vote your shares even when you have not provided instructions on how you would like your shares to be voted. The New York Stock Exchange and the rules of the SEC govern how shares held in brokerage or other accounts may be "discretionarily voted" by brokers and banks in the absence of voting instructions from the actual owner. Under these rules, if you do not direct your broker or bank on how to vote your shares on Proposal One, your shares will remain un-voted on such proposals. 
Therefore, if you hold shares in one or more accounts, it is very important that you direct your broker or bank on how to vote your shares for all proposals. Most banks and brokerage firms permit shareholders to direct their votes via the internet or by telephone. Your broker or bank will provide you with instructions for how to direct the voting of your shares. 
If you would like to vote your shares in person at the meeting: Please contact Ms. Lydia A. Huber, Corporate Secretary of the Company at (419) 446-2501 if you would like information on how to obtain directions to be able to attend the meeting, and vote in person or if you have any additional questions.

Proxy Statement for 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
April 16, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Company"), to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company, to be held at Founders Hall, located at Sauder Village, 22611 State Route 2, Archbold, Ohio 43502 on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 at 7:00 P.M. (local time), and at any adjournments thereof, pursuant to the accompanying Notice of Meeting. 
General Information about the Meeting and Voting Securities and Procedures 
Who may vote at the meeting? 
The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on February 25, 2019 as the record date for the determination of shareholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. Subject to your right to vote cumulatively in the election of directors, if properly implemented, you are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock you held on the record date, including shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• held directly in your name; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• held for you in an account with a broker, bank or other nominee (shares held in "street name").   
[END TABLE]
How many shares must be present to hold the meeting? 
The Company's Code of Regulations generally provides that thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the Company's shares entitled to vote be present in person or by proxy at any meeting shall constitute a quorum for purposes of holding the meeting and conducting business. As of January 1, 2019, there were 11,115,661 shares of the Company's common stock, without par value ("Common Stock") outstanding, of which 93,940 shares are subject to restricted stock grants, the holders of which shares are entitled to vote such shares. Each of the holders of the outstanding shares and restricted stock grants totaling 11,115,661 shares are entitled to one vote per share, subject to the right to vote cumulatively in the election of directors, if properly implemented. Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• are present and vote in person at the meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have properly submitted a proxy card or have voted electronically or by telephone prior to the meeting.   
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. 
What proposals will be voted on at the meeting? 
There are two proposals scheduled to be voted on at the meeting which include the election of members to serve on the Company Board of Directors and an advisory vote on the selection of our independent registered accounting firm, which gives you the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the Company's appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Who is requesting my vote? 
The solicitation of proxies on the enclosed form is made on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company and will be conducted primarily through the mail. Please mail your completed proxy in the envelope included with these proxy materials. In addition to the use of the mail, members of the Board of Directors and certain officers and employees of the Company or its subsidiary may solicit the return of proxies by telephone, facsimile, and other electronic media or through personal contact. The directors, officers and employees that participate in such solicitation will not receive additional compensation for such efforts, but will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses. The cost of preparing, assembling and mailing this Proxy Statement, the Notice of Meeting and the enclosed proxy will be borne by the Company.  How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
Proposal One: 
Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the twelve nominees who receive the largest number of "FOR" votes cast will be elected as directors. 
The laws of Ohio, under which the Company is incorporated, and the Company's Articles of Incorporation provide that if notice in writing is given by any shareholder to the President, Vice President or the Secretary of the Company not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for holding a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing directors, that he desires that the voting at that election shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chairman or Secretary or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving such notice, each shareholder shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as he possesses in voting for directors. Cumulative voting rights allow shareholders to vote the number of shares owned by them times the number of directors to be elected and to cast such votes for one nominee or to allocate such votes among nominees as they deem appropriate. Shareholders will not be entitled to exercise cumulative voting unless at least one shareholder properly notifies the Company of their desire to implement cumulative voting at the Annual Meeting. The Company is soliciting the discretionary authority to cumulate votes represented by proxy, if such cumulative voting rights are exercised. 
Proposal Two: 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the Company's common stock is required to approve Proposal Two, a non-binding advisory vote on the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
What are the effects of abstentions and broker non-votes on each proposal? 
If you hold your shares in a trust or brokerage account (sometimes referred to as holding shares in "street name") please note that your bank or brokerage firm has no discretionary voting authority with respect to Proposal One and therefore cannot vote on any of such proposal in the absence of your instructions. As a result, unless you direct your broker on how to vote your shares with respect to Proposal One, your shares will remain un-voted on Proposal One. Shares held in street name for which no voting instructions have been provided by the beneficial owner (and which are not voted by the broker pursuant to discretionary voting authority) are generally referred to as "broker non-votes". Although abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, they are not considered votes cast. 
Proposal One: 
Under Proposal One, Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the twelve nominees who receive the largest number of "FOR" votes cast will be elected as directors. Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes, if any on Proposal One will have no effect on outcome of the election of Directors. 
Proposal Two: 
Proposal Two requires only the vote of the majority of the "votes cast" at the Annual Meeting. Because abstentions from voting and broker non-votes are not treated as "votes cast", they will have no effect on outcome of the passage of the proposal. 
How does the Board recommend that I vote? 
The Board of Directors urges you to read the Proxy statement carefully and then vote your shares for the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" all of the director nominees listed in Proposal One. The Board also recommends that you vote "FOR" Proposal Two.  How are shares voted? 
For proposal One, a shareholder may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote "FOR" each of the nominees for election to the Company's Board of Directors   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" to vote for one or more nominees  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Abstain from voting on the proposal  
[END TABLE]
For Proposal Two, a shareholder may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote "FOR" the proposal  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote "AGAINST" the proposal  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Abstain from voting on the proposal  
[END TABLE]
If the accompanying proxy is properly signed and returned and is not withdrawn or revoked, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the specifications thereon. If the manner of voting such shares is not indicated on the Proxy, the shares will be voted "FOR" the election of each of the nominees for directors named in Proposal One, and "FOR" the approval of Proposal Two. Your shares will also be voted in the discretion of the proxy committee on any other business properly brought forth at the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held by a broker, your broker is not permitted to discretionarily vote on your behalf in the absence of voting instructions from you for Proposal One. For your vote to be counted in the election of directors you must communicate your voting decisions to your bank, broker or other holder of record before the date of the Annual Meeting. Your broker does have the authority to discretionarily vote your shares in the absence of direction by you on Proposal 2, but may not exercise that discretion or direct the voting of those shares on your behalf in line with your preference. 
How do I vote my shares without attending the meeting? 
Whether you hold shares directly or in "street name", you may direct your vote without attending the Annual Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by granting a proxy as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail – You may vote by mail by signing and dating your proxy card and mailing it in the envelope  provided. You should sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example as guardian, trustee, custodian, attorney or officer of a corporation), you should indicate your name and title  or capacity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Phone – You may vote by phone by calling 1-800-652-VOTE (8683) and following the instructions given.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet – You may vote by internet by going to the following web site, following the instructions given  and entering the requested information on your computer screen:  
[END TABLE]
https://www.investorvote.com/FMAO 
Your vote by phone or internet is valid as authorized by the Ohio General Corporation Law. 
For shares held in "street name", you should follow the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee. You may complete and mail a voting instruction card to your broker or nominee or, in some cases, submit voting instructions by telephone or the internet. If you provide specific voting instructions by mail, telephone, or internet, your broker or nominee will vote your shares as you have directed. Under NYSE Rule 452, brokers will no longer be allowed to vote uninstructed shares in regard to the election of directors. 
How do I vote my shares in person at the meeting? 
Even if you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote by mail, phone or internet so your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting.  If you choose to vote at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you are a shareholder of record, to vote your shares at the meeting you should bring the enclosed proxy card  and proof of identity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you hold your shares in "street name", you must obtain a proxy in your name from your bank, broker  or other holder of record in order to vote at the meeting and bring proof of beneficial ownership, such as a recent brokerage statement or a letter from your bank or broker, and proof of identity.  
[END TABLE]
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy? 
It likely means you hold shares registered in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, sign and return each proxy. 
May I change my vote? 
Yes. The presence of a shareholder at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke such shareholder's previously submitted proxy. However, shareholders may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by filing with the Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation, by delivering to the Company a duly executed proxy bearing a later date than a previously submitted proxy, or by attending the Annual Meeting and notifying the Inspector of Elections of his or her intention to vote in person. Written notices of revoked proxies may be directed to Ms. Norma J. Kauffman, Inspector of Elections of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502. 
When will the proxy and annual report be mailed to shareholders? 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy are being mailed to the Company's shareholders on or about March 12, 2019. 
How may I view the proxy and annual report electronically? 
You may access the reports by going to our website at the following address:

[END TABLE]
 There are no family relationships among any of the directors, nominees for election as directors and executive officers of the Company. 
While it is contemplated that all nominees will stand for election, and the nominees have confirmed this with the Company, if one or more of the nominees at the time of the Annual Meeting should be unavailable or unable to serve as a candidate for election as a director of the Company, the proxies reserve full discretion to vote the common shares represented by the proxies for the election of the remaining nominees and any substitute nominee(s) designated by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the aforementioned persons will be unavailable or unable to serve if elected to the Board. The attached form of proxy grants to the persons listed in such proxy the right to vote shares cumulatively in the election of directors if a shareholder properly implements cumulative voting. 
Proxies in the form solicited hereby which are properly executed and returned to the Company will be voted in favor of each nominee for election to the Board of Directors unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the twelve nominees with the largest number of "FOR" votes cast will be elected as directors. The attached form of proxy grants to the persons listed in such proxy the right to vote shares cumulatively in the election of directors if a shareholder properly implements cumulative voting. Abstentions from voting and broker non-votes, if any, on Proposal One will have no effect on outcome of the election of Directors.

Committees of the Board of Directors 
The following table summarizes the membership of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2018 and each of its committees, and the number of times each met during 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Board     Audit Committee    Compensation Committee    Corporate Governance And Nominating Committee    Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
      Board     Audit Committee    Compensation Committee    Corporate Governance And Nominating Committee    Enterprise Risk Management Committee 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, each director attended 95% or more of the total meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served (held during the period that each served as a director) of the Company and The Farmers & Merchants State Bank. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing salary levels and benefits for the executive officers of the Company. In determining the compensation of the executive officers of the Company's subsidiary, the subsidiary has sought to create a compensation program that relates compensation to financial performance, recognizes individual contributions and achievements, and attracts and retains outstanding executive officers.  The Company has a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which is responsible for recommendations to the full Board of Directors of candidates to serve as Director of the Company and the Bank, and to suggest any proposed amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations and other corporate governance policies. 
The Company also has an Audit Committee established in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 78c (a) (58) (A). The primary function of the Audit Committee is to review the adequacy of the Company's system of internal controls, to oversee the scope and adequacy of the work of the Company's independent public accountants and to approve and engage a firm of accountants to serve as the Company's independent public accountants. 
The Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible to advise the Board of Directors regarding the enterprise risk management framework of the Company. The primary function is to provide oversight to assist the Board of Directors in supervising enterprise risk management activities. The Committee reviews and defines risk exposure limits for each risk category while taking into consideration strategic goals and objectives and current market conditions. 
Corporate Governance 
Starting in 2003, the Company reviewed its corporate governance policies as a matter of good business practices and in light of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes Oxley") and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and listing standards adopted by NASDAQ. While the corporate governance requirements set forth in the NASDAQ listing standards were not applicable to the Company at that time, because it was not listed on NASDAQ, the Company chose to implement most of those corporate governance policies to encourage appropriate conduct among the members of its Board of Directors, officers and employees and to assure that the Company operates in an efficient and ethical manner. On May 10, 2017, the Company began listing on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange and became subject to the NASDAQ Capital Market listing standards and corporate governance requirements. 
In consideration of the size, complexity, and nature of the Company's business, the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee have chosen to establish separate positions for the President and the Board Chairman in order to maintain a separation of power and duties to further strengthen the governance structure. The Board Chairman is a non-employee, director who is not directly involved with the daily operations of the Company. Thus, the Board Chairman is able to focus attention on corporate structure and future strategic direction. The Board Chairman serves as the leader of the Board of Directors, presiding over full board meetings and ensuring full accountability for the shareholders' interests. Effectively monitoring the decisions and actions of management is one of the primary roles of the Board of Directors. The President and Chief Executive Officer is a bank insider providing management and leadership for ongoing operations of the Company, as well as the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, who is also accountable to the Board of Directors. Succession plans exist for the Board Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Vice Chairman of the Board, and all the Executive Officers of the Bank.  
In May of 2018, the Board of Directors established a Search Committee to retain a successor for Paul Siebenmorgen, the President and CEO of the Company and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, as he began formally planning for retirement. The Search Committee included the following members of the Board of Directors: Kevin Sauder, Chairman, Jack Johnson, Anthony Rupp, Dr. Marcia Latta, and Mr. Siebenmorgen as an ex officio member. Alan Kaplan CEO of Kaplan Partners, a CEO and executive management development consulting firm was retained to assist with the search for the President and CEO. On September 13, 2018, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, entered into an Employment Agreement with Lars B. Eller. At that time, Mr. Eller became the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank. Subject to the intended succession plan upon the retirement of Mr. Siebenmorgen, Mr. Eller assumed the additional position of President and CEO of the Company on February 1, 2019.  Director Independence 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company undertakes a review of director independence annually and reports on its findings to the full Board in connection with its recommendation of nominees for election to the Board of Directors. 
Based upon the review and report of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors has determined that, (A) all directors have met the independence standards of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules; and (B) no directors have any relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. With the exception of Mr. Siebenmorgen, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank; Mr. Eller, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank; and Mr. Briggs, the First Senior Vice President of Business Development of the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, who are all deemed to not be independent. In addition, the members of each of the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Audit Committee were determined to be, and under the terms of the respective charters, will continue to be "independent" pursuant to standards adopted by NASDAQ for such committees. 
Committee Charters 
The Board of Directors has adopted charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Copies of the charters for each of these committees are available on the Bank's website (www.fm.bank), and are available upon request from the Company. Shareholders desiring a paper copy of one or all of the charters should address written requests to Ms. Lydia A. Huber, Corporate Secretary of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502. 
Code of Conduct and Ethics 
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"). The Code applies to all officers, directors and employees of the Company and the Bank. The administration of the Code has been delegated to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, a committee comprised entirely of "independent directors". The Code addresses topics such as compliance with laws and regulations, honest and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, confidentiality and protection of Company assets, fair dealing and accurate and timely periodic reports, and also provides for enforcement mechanisms. The Board and management of the Company intend to continue to monitor not only the developing legal requirements in this area, but also the best practices of comparable companies, to assure that the Company maintains sound corporate governance practices in the future. 
A copy of the Company's Code is available on the website of the Bank (www.fm.bank). In addition, a copy of the Code is available to any shareholder free of charge upon request. Shareholders desiring a copy of the Code should address written requests to Ms. Lydia A. Huber, Corporate Secretary of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502, and are asked to mark Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on the outside of the envelope containing the request. 
Nominations for Members of the Board of Directors 
As noted above under "Corporate Governance", the Company has a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The current members of the committee all are "independent directors" (as defined by NASDAQ). The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has developed a policy regarding the consideration of nominations for directors by shareholders. The policy is posted on the Bank's website for review by shareholders. As outlined in its policy, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider nominations from shareholders, although it does not actively solicit such nomination recommendations. Proposed nominations should be addressed to Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502. Such nominations must include a description of the specific qualifications the candidate possesses and a discussion as to the effect on the composition and effectiveness of the Board. The identification and  evaluation of all candidates for nominee to the Board of Directors are undertaken on an ad hoc basis within the context of the Company's strategic initiatives at the time a vacancy occurs on the Board or as anticipated retirement dates approach. In evaluating all candidates, including candidates recommended for nomination by shareholders, the committee considers a variety of factors, including the candidate's integrity, independence, qualifications, skills, occupation, experience (including experiences in finance and banking), familiarity with accounting rules and practices, and compatibility with existing members of the Board. In addition, attributes such as place of residence and geographic markets represented, age, gender, involvement and visibility in the counties and communities represented by the Company's current and future geographic footprint, and relationships with the Company and the Bank are given consideration. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for nominees, although the committee may consider such other factors as it may deem at the time to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, which factors may change from time to time. 
To maintain a wide-ranging mix of individuals, primary consideration is given to the depth and breadth of an individual's business and civic experience in leadership positions, as well as their ties to the Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc.'s markets. Consideration has been given to the number of directors based on the board size of the nine peer bank holding companies as identified in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for comparison of executive officer compensation. The Board of Directors conducted a Self-Evaluation during 2018. Consideration was given to each director's attendance at board meetings and committee meetings, as well as anticipated retirement dates and other events that might affect a director's continued service. Based on the Board Self-Evaluation results, all current directors were deemed eligible for nomination in the ensuing year. 
On September 21, 2018, the Board of Directors opened a seat on the Board and appointed Lars Eller to the Board of Directors for both The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank. Mr. Eller joined the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, as the President and Chief Executive Officer on September 18, 2018. He subsequently assumed the additional position of President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company upon the retirement of the then current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on February 1, 2019. An additional seat on the Board of Directors was opened by the Board on December 20, 2018. Andrew Briggs, the former Chairman of Limberlost Bancshares, Inc., was appointed to fill this seat as a Director for both the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, upon the completion of the merger on January 1, 2019 of Limberlost Bancshares, Inc. with the Company. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will continue to assess and evaluate how the Board of Directors is functioning and whether additional board members are needed. Attention will also be given to anticipated retirement dates and other events that might affect a director's continued service. 
As currently comprised, the Board of Directors is a diverse group of individuals who are drawn from various market sectors and industry groups with a presence in the Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc.'s markets. Board members are individuals with leadership skills, extensive knowledge, and proven experience who reside in, serve and represent the Company's geographic footprint throughout the counties and communities served, as well as the broader region. Current board representation provides a background in accounting, auditing, agriculture, community banking, construction, economics, finance, financial services, fund raising, manufacturing, retail, commercial, and education. The expertise of these individuals covers accounting and financial reporting, economics and economic analysis, corporate management and leadership, professional development, strategic planning, business acquisitions, marketing, education, human resources and employee relations, retail sales, small business operations, and family farm operations.

Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that an adequate risk management framework is in place and functioning as intended. A clear understanding and working knowledge of the types of risks inherent to the Company's activities is an absolute necessity. The Board has appointed a Risk Committee comprised of the following ten members: the President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Sr. Commercial Loan Officer, Operations & Information Technology Officer, EVP of Retail Banking, Marketing Director, Deposit Administrator and the Risk Management Officer. The Risk Committee is responsible for loss control and day-to-day oversight of the risk management function. 
The risk management program focuses risk assessment on nine risk categories. The Risk Committee meets monthly and reviews several risk categories each month ensuring all risk categories are reviewed quarterly. Each risk category is assigned a risk rating (High, Moderate, Low) based on the significance of the risk and a risk trend (Increasing, Decreasing, or Stable) is defined. Additional internal bank experts may attend meetings during each quarter to report on a risk category under review and offer recommendations regarding the risk assessment and trend for a particular risk category. Results of the monthly review of risk categories are reported to the Board of Directors Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERM) each quarter. In addition, the Company's risk position is reported to the Board of Directors quarterly. Risk management reports include the following:

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recommendations for changes to risk parameters or measurement tools.  
[END TABLE]
 The Board ERM Committee defines risk exposure limits for each risk category taking into consideration the bank's strategic goals and objectives and current market conditions. The Board ERM Committee reviews and approves any necessary changes to risk exposure limits after careful consideration of any changes in market conditions or corporate strategy and adopts guidelines, through the input of the Risk Committee's analysis and discussion, regarding the maximum loss exposure the Bank is able and willing to assume. At least annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the risk management program and policies based on information presented throughout the year from the Risk Committee. 
Credit Risk 
Credit risk is addressed in formal loan proposals presented to the Loan Committee and the Board of Directors. Loans and potential loan relationships greater than $250,000 are analyzed by the Credit Analyst Department and require a formal loan proposal and approval by the appropriate loan committee. Regardless of whether a new loan request, a formal loan proposal, or an annual loan relationship review, each proposed loan, existing loan, or loan relationship has an assigned Loan Risk Rating based on credit factors, collateral adequacy, and financial strength of the loan relationship. Decisions are made based on the most complete up-to-date information available. The defined Loan Risk Ratings are designed to cover a broad range of customers, so dominant risk characteristics determine the rating assigned. In some instances, additional pricing, collateral, covenants, or risk mitigants may be necessary to reduce risk or credit exposure or to improve relationship profitability. 
Interest Rate Risk 
Interest rate risk is a large component of asset/liability management and is managed within the overall asset/liability framework. The principal objectives of asset/liability management are to manage sensitivity of net interest spreads and net interest income to potential changes in interest rates. Funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk-taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed. The Board of Directors seeks to address interest rate and non-interest income risk tolerances and, thereby, control risks. Goals are (1) to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets and, given fluctuations in the external interest-rate environment, (2) to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets. 
This type of risk focuses on the economic scenarios relative to the value of the Bank in the current interest rate environment, and the sensitivity to that value from changes in interest rates. Re-pricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and options risk are types of interest risk to be considered. Interest rate risk occurs due to differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); and from changing rate relationships across the range of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options embedded in bank products (options risk). Interest risk considerations typically include the effect of a change in interest rates on both the bank's accrual earnings and the market value of portfolio equity. 
Interest rate sensitivity refers to the Bank's capability and/or need to react to actual and forecast interest rates and yields in the money and capital markets as well as in the local competitive environment. The magnitude of these gains or losses depends on the severity and timing of the market changes and on the ability to adjust. The ability to adjust is controlled by the remaining time to maturity of fixed-rate contracts, customer actions, and the existence of contracts that provide for rate adjustments prior to maturity. Analysis of interest rate sensitivity in the form of a net interest rate shock is employed. In performing interest rate shock analysis, financial forecasting and simulation are used to anticipate the impact of forecast interest rates and evaluate the potential risk of alternative interest rates. This policy is implemented by first producing a current forecast of balance sheet volumes and net earnings for the 12 month forecast horizon. The second step is for eight alternative simulations to be prepared to test the forecast's sensitivity to interest-rate shocks and changes in the shape of the treasury yield curve. The four alternative simulations are +/- 100, +/- 200, +/- 300 and +/-400 basis point shift. After each alternative simulation, the forecast net interest income for the twelve-month period and the present value of equity at the end of the historical period are compared to the net interest income and present value of equity produced by the alternative simulation. The percent changes in net interest income and present value of equity is then compared to management's guideline targets. The Bank also looks at varying scenarios such as nonparallel shifts in the yield curve. The model used for the simulations continues to be analyzed for possible refinements to assumptions. However, neither of financial forecasting or simulation adequately  forecasts the impact of potential changes in interest rates on net interest income. A yearly forecast of balance sheet volumes and net earnings is relied upon as a basis for asset liability decisions. Each forecast is subject to testing for alternative interest rate possibilities to evaluate the risk inherent in management's plans. The alternative interest rate possibilities are (1) an immediate 200 basis point change in average interest rates, or (2) a more gradual change in average interest rates. Management believes the first method (instant change) would portray the worst case scenario as an impact on net interest earnings. Therefore, method 1 is used in the interest rate shock analysis. 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk may impact earnings or capital based on changes in funding sources. This risk affects the Bank's ability to establish new relationships, service, or continue to service existing relationships. This risk can also expose the Bank to litigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Liquidity risk exposure is present in various funding situations. Thus the Bank is responsible for careful evaluation of the types and levels of risk incurred in dealing with its customers and communities. The liquidity risk policy provides direction and guidance for the management of funding sources, which also affects interest rate risk and price risk. Guidance offered provides controls for the risk arising from taking positions in various liquid assets and short-term deposits regarding anticipated changes in interest rates. Controls are vital to the continuity of operations and protections of resources, depositors, and shareholders. It also assists in maximizing the return on shareholder investment without sacrificing its quality and reputation. Various elements of funding volume and funding gaps are analyzed, the availability and size of secondary markets to convert instruments to cash is reviewed, the Bank's cost of funding versus costs paid by competition are assessed, and rate scenarios and stress testing models are used to assess vulnerability. This risk is evaluated and assigned a risk rating with the assessment of overall risk. 
Price Risk 
Price risk involves risk that may impact earnings or capital resulting from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments. This risk affects the Bank's ability to establish new relationships, service, or continue to service existing relationships. Management of this risk is conducted under specific guidelines and product/service standards. Guidelines assist in establishing, reevaluating, and changing prices for financial services or financial products. These guidelines are structured to ensure an appropriate pricing structure, but also address such issues as volume and price sensitivity for various products. Sources of price risk are identified, elements of the of the risk positions are analyzed, the flexibility of the current price profile versus the ability to hedge the risk is assessed, the proper balance of risk versus reward is determined, and appropriate levels of procedures, controls, and self-monitoring are evaluated for implementation and proper administration. A risk rating is assigned in conjunction with the assessment of overall risk. 
Foreign Exchange Risk 
Foreign Exchange Risk may occur to earnings or capital as a result of movement of foreign exchange rates due to cross-border investing and operating activities. Market making and position taking in foreign currencies involve foreign exchange risk. In most instances foreign checks received are sent for collection. Risk is minimized with issuance of drafts, letters of credit, and wire transfers through correspondent banks. Risk exposure involves litigation, financial loss, and damage to its reputation. Foreign exchange risk is monitored and evaluated and assigned a risk rating with the assessment of overall risk. 
Compliance Risk 
Compliance risk is monitored within the structure of the compliance risk management program. Operating in compliance with laws, rules, regulations, and related accepted industry standards enhances the reputation, strategic goals and objectives, and operations of the Company. Compliance risk attempts to evaluate and identify the overall level of compliance risk by measuring and defining the areas of risk for a designated law, rule, or regulation. Defined risk factors within three risk categories (legal and regulatory, operational, and reputation risk) assist in determining the overall compliance risk rating assigned to each law, rule, or regulation. Various factors within each risk category can increase or decrease the risk of non-compliance. Each risk category is assigned a risk rating of High, Moderate, or Low. The overall compliance risk rating for each law or regulation is the average of the risk ratings for the three risk categories. The compliance risk assessment is conducted with the Compliance Committee and key business lines, departments, and functional areas. Compliance risk assessment results are reviewed by the Compliance Committee and reported to the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  In addition to an overall compliance risk assessment, specific regulations require risk assessments based on defined risk factors. Identity Theft Red Flags regulations require an annual Identity Theft risk assessment. The purpose of this risk assessment is to periodically review and update the Identity Theft Red Flag Program based on methods used to open accounts, methods available to access accounts, ongoing account monitoring, and the Company's experiences with identity theft. Regulators expect a risk assessment process for Fair Lending risk. A fair lending risk assessment serves to verify how lending activities are identified, monitored, measured, and controlled, to make sure discriminatory, unfair, deceptive, abusive, and predatory acts and practices do not take place. A fair lending risk assessment is conducted to evaluate the present risk management process and risk mitigation strategies. Risk indicators defined by interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures are used to assess fair lending risk. In evaluating the risk in lending activities, the following factors are considered: changes in leadership and staffing, new products, product pricing, product and service offerings, policies and procedures, processes, and changes or updates to systems. Other factors considered included the present economy of the region, the market area served, and market area demographics. These risk assessments are conducted with key business lines, departments, and functional areas as applicable. Fair Lending Risk assessment results are reviewed by the Compliance Committee and reported to the Risk Committee and Board Audit Committee. 
An overall compliance risk assessment is conducted for the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). Additionally, more in depth risk assessments for BSA, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Customer Identification Program (CIP), and OFAC are conducted on an as needed basis by a select group of BSA trained individuals with the results reported as necessary to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors for approval. At least annually, the quantified results are reported to the Board of Directors. These Risk assessments focus on risk factors due to the Bank's size, market presence, types of customers, types of products, geographic location, method of account opening, transaction type and are incorporated into BSA/AML software to aid in the monitoring and reporting requirements. 
Transaction/Operational Risk 
Transaction risk relates to service or product delivery and escalates based on problems with services or product delivery. This risk is inherent in all bank products and services and arises on a daily basis as transactions are processed. Controlling transaction risk involves internal controls, vendor management, proper use of information systems, employee integrity, and operating processes. The Board of Directors and Management establish and reevaluate the risk tolerances which thereby control these risks. Policy guidance provides standards to control the potential financial losses due to human error or fraud, incomplete information, or operational disruption. Controlling this risk remains critical to the continuity of operations and protection of resources, depositors, customers, and shareholders. It also assists the Bank to maximize the return on shareholder investment without sacrificing its quality and reputation. Financial services and products are offered on a sound and economically feasible basis to the customers, communities, and markets served. Products and services offered along with the transactions serviced are conducted under specific guidelines and operational standards. Procedures and processes, including the development and introduction of new products and services, encompass the guidelines established. 
Control mechanisms have been established to monitor data accuracy, proper accounting treatment, and compliance with laws and regulations, as well as bank policy. Management and staff continually seek training and development to enhance their technical knowledge and skill levels to stay up-to-date on changes in financial service industry operations and industry best practices. Development and issuance of timely internal management reports and bank-wide communication on properly conducting business relative to the transaction risk exposure are ongoing measures. Methodologies to address areas of exposure from human error or fraud, incomplete information, and operational disruption seek to evaluate, mitigate, and identify cost-effective ways to reduce such risks. Analysis and recommendations focus on systems development and utilization, capital investment for technology and hardware, and overall physical premises improvements to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in handling new products and services, complex transactions, and development of new products and services to keep pace with the future.  Strategic Risk 
Strategic risk is a function of the compatibility between the bank's strategic goals, its business strategies, the resources used to meet strategic goals, and the quality of implementation. Resources necessary to carry out business strategies include both those that are tangible and those that are intangible. Strategic risk incorporates management's analyses of external factors that affect the strategic direction of the bank. Anticipating change, both externally and internally, are essential to managing this risk. Strategic risk arises from adverse business decisions or improper implementations of business decisions. 
Addressing specific risk tolerances from a strategic focus aids in controlling this risk. The Board of Directors and management provide direction and guidance regarding merger and acquisition plans, marketing initiatives, initiation of diversity in product elements, technology changes, and other related strategic moves. Controlling this risk is necessary for the continuity of operations and protection of resources, depositors, customers, and shareholders. It also assists in maximizing the return on shareholder investment without sacrificing quality or reputation. 
Information Technology Risk 
Information Technology (IT) governance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors. The core elements of IT governance encompass value, risk, and controls. Management has appointed the Operations and IT Officer the responsibility for overall management of Information Technology risk. IT risk focuses on information and information systems, especially the most critical and vital information assets. Without reliable and properly secured information systems, business operations could be severely disrupted. Likewise, the preservation and enhancement of the Company's reputation is directly linked to the way in which both information and information systems are managed. Maintaining an adequate level of security is one of several important aspects of managing IT risk. 
The Information Systems (IS) Steering Committee serves as an advisory group providing assistance and guidance to management regarding customer information security, information systems planning, systems management organization, systems performance, business continuity, information security, system related expenditures, vendor management, and related policies and procedures. The IS Steering Committee is chaired by the Operations and IT Officer and meets on a monthly basis. Committee members are Executive Management representatives, the Operations and IT Officer, the Information Security Officer, the IT Manager, the Compliance Manager, the Chief Lending Officer and the Risk Manager. Formal meeting minutes serve to document decisions and recommendations by the IS Steering Committee. Meeting minutes are reported to the Management Committee and the Board ERM Committee.
An annual Information Technology Audit, which is facilitated by the Internal Audit Department, is conducted via a co-sourcing agreement with a third party auditor. The objective of the IT audit is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, test the reliability of data and IT controls, and ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, guidance, and industry best practices. The audit scope addresses IT Governance, IT Management, IT Operations, and IT Security. The following systems and applications were evaluated based on operational criticality and security risks: Network Resources, Core Data Processing, Internet Banking (Business and Retail), ATM and Debit Cards, Credit Cards, Wire Transfer, ACH Processing, Report and Document Storage, Commercial and Consumer Lending, Mortgage Lending, Custom Report Writing, Accounting, and Payroll. 
Testing of the internal network environment and external network perimeter are included in the Results of the IT Audit and are reviewed with the IS Steering Committee and Management. For any exceptions identified, a responsible party is assigned and action plans are developed to address corrective measures. The final results of the IT Audit are reviewed with the Board Audit Committee. The status of unresolved audit issues along with their priority ratings is reported to both Management and the Board Audit Committee at each meeting. 
Financial Reporting Internal Controls. Sarbanes-Oxley introduced broad and challenging financial management and disclosure regulations. Non-compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations has serious consequences. As an accelerated SEC filer, the requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are applicable to the Company. Section 404 requires companies to maintain internal controls and procedures for financial  reporting. Management conducts an on-going review of key financial controls over financial reporting that ensures the accuracy of financial statements and entity-level controls that ensure compliance with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) internal control framework requirements. The COSO framework consists of five components that actively impact one another: control environment; risk assessment; control activities; information and communication; and monitoring. These components often overlap and consistently evolve due to changes in the Company's internal and external environment. 
The review includes discussions with employees, process demonstrations, and detailed transaction testing to determine that controls are designed properly and operating effectively. The Company's external auditor conducts its own Sarbanes-Oxley review independent of management's review. Both management and the external auditor issue an opinion regarding both the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls over financial reporting. Results of both Sarbanes-Oxley reviews are reported to the Board of Directors. 
Information Security. In conformance with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requirements regarding safeguarding and protecting customer information, an Information Security Risk Assessment is conducted at least annually by the Risk Department and reviewed with the Risk Committee, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, and the Board of Directors. A risk analysis is performed to evaluate current processes, identify information assets, and determine the adequacy of the safeguarding and protection of confidential customer information collected and maintained. For each information asset identified, the criticality of the asset, the threats to the defined asset, the likelihood of compromise of the asset, the business impact if an asset is compromised, and an overall risk rating for each asset are defined. The results of this assessment are reviewed with the Information Systems (IS) Steering Committee and the Risk Committee and reported at least annually to the Board ERM Committee. 
Vendor Management. The Board of Directors bears ultimate responsibility to ensure an effective vendor management program has been implemented for proper oversight of outsourced relationships. Management is charged with the responsibility to determine the necessary course of action to develop and maintain a comprehensive vendor management program. Management has appointed the Operations and Information Technology Officer/ISO to oversee management of the vendor management program. This individual reports directly to the Information Systems (IS) Steering Committee and management. The Senior Operations Officer is the focal point for vendor management standards established by the IS Steering Committee and is responsible for implementation of procedures relating to vendor management. A vendor relationship subcommittee has been established to provide assistance and promote appropriate oversight of third party vendors and service providers, especially technology service providers, who provide products, services, and support for other such activities. Current subcommittee members consist of the Risk Management Officer, the Operations and Information Technology Officer/ISO, the Senior Operations Officer, and the Assistant Compliance Manager. 
The vendor management program is used to identify, measure, monitor, and control the risks associated with outsourcing arrangements. Outsourced relationships are addressed from an end to end perspective. The vendor management process reviews and evaluates the internal controls, maintenance and upkeep of an outsourced product or system, and the financial condition of third party vendors or service providers prior to selection for a new product or service, or as a condition for continued support of products and services. Third party vendors and service provider relationships are ranked by risk (High, Moderate, Low) annually as part of subcommittee's ongoing efforts. Rankings are based on the residual risk of the relationship after analyzing the quantity of risk relative to the controls over those risks. Relationships with high risk ratings receive more frequent and stringent monitoring for due diligence, performance (financial and/or operational), and independent control validation reviews. 
Management and the Board of Directors use oversight and monitoring documentation when renegotiating contracts, as well as in developing contingency planning requirements. Third party vendors and service providers may be required to sign a formal confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Such an agreement binds these parties to the same standards and level of data confidentiality and controls as those adhered to by the Company. High risk third party vendors and service providers may be required to provide proof of bonding or insurance. The Senior Operations Officer reports annually to the Board of Directors providing an update on the status of the vendor management program along with any significant changes or recommendations to the program.  Reputation Risk 
Reputation risk exposure is present throughout the organization and is embedded in the reviews of each risk management category. The types and levels of risk must continually be evaluated in dealings with customers and the communities. Reputation risk refers to the risk to bank capital or earnings arising from negative public opinion. Reputation risk is inherent in all bank activities. It can affect the bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, as well as its ability to continue servicing its existing relationships. An abundance of caution is needed in dealing with bank customers and the community to preserve the bank's reputation. 
The Board of Directors and management provide direction and guidance for addressing risks to the Company and the Bank's reputation in the marketplace. Identification of areas of risk minimizes and controls reputation risk. A reputation risk policy offers corporate guidance in anticipating and responding to changes in the market. Controlling this risk is vital to the continuity of operations and protections of resources, depositors, customers, and shareholders. Maximizing the return on shareholder investment without sacrificing quality and reputation are drivers for proper identification and management of reputation risk. Being responsive to Bank customers, making prudent credit risk and interest risk decisions, strong internal controls, sound operations limiting fraud or materials losses, and maintaining strong confidentiality standards are sound practices to minimize reputation risk exposure. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors submits the following report on the performance of its responsibilities for the year 2018. The purposes and responsibilities of the committee are elaborated in the committee charter. The Board of Directors has determined that Steven A. Everhart, Chairman of the Audit Committee, is a "financial expert" as defined under the regulations promulgated under Sarbanes-Oxley. Mr. Everhart and all of the other members of the Audit Committee have been determined by the Board of Directors to be "independent" under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. 
Management of the Company has primary responsibility for the financial statements and the overall reporting process, including the Company's system of internal controls. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB/United States). This audit serves as a basis for the auditors' opinion in the annual report to shareholders addressing whether the financial statements fairly present the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In reviewing the independence of the Company's external auditors, the committee received from BKD, LLP ("BKD") the written disclosures and a letter regarding relationships between BKD and its related entities and the Company and its related entities and discussed with BKD its independence from the Company as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the Company's internal controls, accounting and financial reporting policies and auditing practices, the committee has reviewed and discussed with management and BKD the Company's audited financial statements for 2018. In this connection, the committee has discussed with BKD its judgments about the quality, in addition to the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting, as required by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. Based on these reviews and discussions, the committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on SEC Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

If the resolution approving BKD, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is rejected by the shareholders, the Committee will reconsider its choice of independent auditors. Even if the resolution is approved, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Vote Required to Approve 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the Company's common stock is required to approve Proposal Two. 
THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY PROPOSAL ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Introduction. The Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation program. The committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, is responsible for reviewing and determining executive officer compensation, for evaluating the President and Chief Executive Officer, for overseeing the evaluation of all other officers and employees, for administering our incentive compensation programs (including the long-term stock incentive plan), for approving and overseeing the administration of our employee benefits programs, for providing insight and guidance to management with respect to employee compensation, and for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to director compensation. The President and Chief Executive Officer participates with respect to making recommendations concerning annual salary adjustments and long term equity incentive compensation regarding executive officers (other than himself) of the Company. 
The Compensation Committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews the adequacy of its charter and recommends changes to the Board for approval. The Compensation Committee meets at scheduled times during the year and also acts upon occasion by written consent. The Chair of the Compensation Committee reports on committee activities and makes committee recommendations at meetings of the Board of Directors. 
Compensation Philosophy. Our executive compensation programs seek to achieve and maintain equity with respect to balancing the interests of shareholders and executive officers, while supporting our need to attract and retain competent executive management. The Compensation Committee has developed an executive compensation policy, along with supporting executive compensation plans and programs, which are intended to attain the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Support a pay-for-performance policy that rewards executive officers for corporate performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Motivate executive officers to achieve strategic business goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide competitive compensation opportunities critical to the Company's long-term success.   
[END TABLE]
The committee collects and analyzes comparative executive compensation information from relevant peer groups, approves executive salary adjustments, recommends executive discretionary cash-based incentive/compensation program thresholds, and administers the Company's long term stock incentive plan (the "Long Term Incentive Plan"). Additionally, from time to time, the committee reviews other human resource issues, including benefits, management performance appraisals, and succession planning.  The committee uses comparisons of competitive executive pay practices taken from banking industry compensation surveys and, from time-to-time, consultation with independent executive compensation advisors. Peer groups and competitive compensation practices are determined using executive compensation packages at bank holding companies and subsidiaries of comparable size to the Company and its subsidiary. In evaluating Peer Group Companies, the base salary and incentive compensation paid to the chief executive officer of each of the following nine peer bank holding companies (symbol), as well as the respective ROA (Return on Assets) of each are taken into consideration. The committee reviews this information at least once a year in conjunction with events in the industry and marketplace to determine if any changes or revisions are deemed necessary. For 2018 compensation considerations, the Peer Group Companies consisted of nine bank holding companies: Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CVIB), Farmers National Banc Corp. (FMNB), First Defiance Financial Corp. (FDEF), Mutual First Financial, Inc. (MFSF), Horizon Bancorp, Inc. (HBNC), LCNB Corp. (LCNB), MBT Financial Corp. (MBTF), SB Financial Group, Inc. (SBFG), and United Bancshares, Inc. (UBOH). 
The financial performance of the selected peer group bank holding companies is also evaluated relevant to the performance of peers located outside of the Midwest, which information is made available by the FDIC as part of its Uniform Bank Performance Report. The Company may periodically review and adjust the selected peer group companies in conjunction with a regular review of executive compensation pay and practices in connection with future compensation decisions. 
In making its decisions regarding annual salary adjustments, the committee reviews quantitative and qualitative performance factors as part of an annual performance appraisal. These are established for each executive position and the performance of the incumbent executive is evaluated annually against these standards. This appraisal is then integrated with market-based adjustments to salary ranges to determine if a base salary increase is merited. 
The committee administers the cash-based incentive compensation program and the Long Term Incentive Plan. Cash-based incentive bonuses and equity awards are at-risk compensation. Awards under these programs are recommended by the committee to the Board of Directors when, in the judgment of committee members, such awards are deemed to provide executive officers a reasonable incentive for the achievement of the Company's mid and long-term strategic objective, and are otherwise justified by the performance of executive officers in relation to the performance of the Company. 
The accounting and tax treatment of particular forms of compensation do not materially affect the committee's compensation decisions. However, the committee evaluates the effect of such accounting and tax treatment on an ongoing basis and will make appropriate modifications to its compensation policies where appropriate. 
Components of Compensation. The elements of total compensation paid by the Company to its senior officers, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and the other executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table which appears following this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the CEO and the other executive officers identified in that Table are sometimes referred to collectively as the "Named Executive Officers"), include the following:

[END TABLE]
Base Salary. The base salaries of the Named Executive Officers are reviewed by the committee annually as well as at the time of any promotion or significant change in job responsibilities. The committee reviews peer group data to establish a market-competitive executive base salary program, in conjunction with a formal performance appraisal system that focuses on awards that are integrated with strategic corporate objectives. Salary income for each Named Executive Office for calendar year 2018 is reported in the "Salary" column 1 of the Summary Compensation Table, which appears following this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.  In making its decisions regarding annual salary adjustments for 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed quantitative and qualitative performance factors as part of an annual performance appraisal. This appraisal is then integrated with market-based adjustments to salary ranges to determine if a base salary increase is merited. Due to Mr. Siebenmorgen's anticipated retirement in early 2019 and the terms of Mr. Eller's Employment Agreement, the committee made no recommended changes to annual base salary for Mr. Siebenmorgen or Mr. Eller. 
Cash-Based Incentive Compensation Program. The Company has established a cash-based incentive compensation program. The cash incentive for executive officers under this plan is based on two criteria. The first is return on average assets ("ROA") of the Bank. 
If the ROA of the Bank equals the target ROA of 1.20%, executive officers receive the full cash incentive established. The targeted goal of ROA is based on reviewing the projected budget, the five and ten year history and average of the Bank along with peer, industry, and other information requested by the Compensation Committee. The calculated ROA is inclusive of the cost of the incentive and is net of the captive insurance expense at the Bank level, and additionally excludes merger-related expenses incurred in 2018 pertaining to the merger transaction involving Limberlost Bancshares, Inc. The full cash incentive under this criterion is equivalent to 30% of base salary for the CEO and the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, and 20% of base salary for the remaining executive officers. If the ROA of the Bank is equal to .90%, fifty percent of the incentive is paid. If the ROA is between .85% and 1.20%, the incentive is paid on a prorated basis. Should the ROA exceed 1.20%, the incentive paid would be increased accordingly. At an ROA of .85%, a forty percent payout is made. Again, with ROA between .85% and .90%, the payout is prorated. Should the ROA be below .85%, no cash incentive is paid under the computation; incentive compensation would then be paid under the same terms to all employees of the Bank. The projected 2018 incentive was based on a calculated ROA base of 1.33% which was inclusive of the cost of the incentive and is net of the captive insurance expense. The percentage of base salary for this incentive is paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. The target percentage along with budget and base may be adjusted for 2019. 
The second criterion used in determining the cash incentive to be paid to executive officers is earnings per share ("EPS") of the Company. The target EPS goal is based on reviewing past performance and history and the projected EPS from the budget. The EPS incentive target ranges were set as follows: a 5% incentive would be paid for an EPS of $1.10, a 10% incentive would be paid for an EPS of $1.25, and a 15% incentive would be paid for an EPS of $1.40. If the EPS is below $1.10, an incentive would not be paid for this criterion. An EPS in between the stated targets or exceeding $1.40 would be adjusted accordingly. The percentage of base salary for the incentive is paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. The target EPS and corresponding percentages may be adjusted for 2019.
The budget or forecast ROA and EPS used for the 2018 incentives were set equivalent to the expected performance of normal operations.
In establishing dual incentives for the executive officers of the Bank, the objective of the Company is to limit the risk exposure to compensating for short term gains while still recognizing the importance of return to its shareholders each year. Thus more emphasis is placed on rewarding for stable, long term performance through the use of ROA criterion along with a higher percentage of pay at risk. The EPS criterion recognizes a yearly target and focuses on the importance of earning performance and its impact on maintaining a healthy profitable corporation from which to pay dividends to shareholders and to maintain and improve the value of their stock. Each year, the committee sets goals for each incentive which it believes are attainable, but still require executives' performance at a consistently high level to achieve target award levels. As such, the Company believes it has established an equitable and reasonable balance in the incentives for executive management. Given that the target ROA and EPS may be adjusted each year at the Board's discretion, the Company feels it has established a plan that is beneficial to both its executives and shareholders by placing overall emphasis on corporate performance and return to shareholders.  Further discussion of the Bank's overall incentive plan may be found in the 2018 financial report and 10-K. 
Incentive Stock Compensation. The Bank uses the grant of stock awards under our Long Term Incentive Plan as the primary vehicle for providing long-term incentive compensation opportunities to its officers, including the Named Executive Officers. The grant of stock awards is intended to serve as both a recruitment tool, as well as an officer retention tool, and as such requires a three-year cliff vesting period prior to issuance without restrictions. Officers' and Named Executive Officers' past and future services are considered for grants of stock awards. The Bank has not adopted any specific policy regarding the amount or timing of any stock-based compensation under the plan. The number of shares underlying the award granted to each Named Executive Officer in 2018 is set forth in the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table and the fair value dollar amount, determined on the grant date, for calendar year 2016, 2017, and 2018 with respect to each such award is set forth in the column titled Stock Awards of the Summary Compensation Table, each of which follows. Information concerning the number of stock awards held by each Named Executive Officer as of December 31, 2018 is set forth in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end Table, which also follows.
Profit Sharing Plan. The Bank has established a 401(k) profit sharing plan that allows eligible employees to save at a minimum one percent of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to certain Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Bank will match 50% of employee 401(k) contributions up to four percent of total eligible compensation. In addition, the Bank may make a discretionary contribution from time to time as is deemed advisable. A participant is 100% vested in the participant's deferral contributions. A six-year vesting schedule applies to employer discretionary contributions and employee matching contributions. In order to be eligible to participate, the employee must be 21 years of age, have completed six months of service, work 1,000 hours in the plan year and be employed on the last day of the year. Entry dates have been established at January 1 and July 1 of each year. The plan calls for only lump-sum distributions upon either termination of employment, retirement, death, or disability. The Company's contribution to the plan made on behalf of the Named Executive Officers is included under the "All Other Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Health and Welfare Benefits. The Company provides healthcare, life and disability insurance and other employee welfare benefits programs to its employees, including its executive officers. The committee is responsible for overseeing the administration of these programs and believes that its employee benefits programs should be comparable to those maintained by other members of the relevant peer groups so as to assure that the Company is able to maintain a competitive position in terms of attracting and retaining officers and other employees. Except for our Executive Survivor Income Agreement, our employee benefits plans are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees. 
The Company has entered into Executive Survivor Income Agreements with some of the Named Executive Officers that provide certain death benefits to the executive's beneficiaries upon his or her death. The agreements provide a pre-retirement and post-retirement death benefit payable to the beneficiaries of the executive in the event of the executive's death. The Company had originally purchased life insurance policies on the lives of all participants covered by these agreements in amounts sufficient to provide the sums necessary to pay the beneficiaries. As the employees age and their pay increased, the Company is made whole on its investment before beneficiaries receive any proceeds. Therefore, over time, the death benefit payable to the beneficiary may be smaller than the previously anticipated value. Two former executives and one current Named Executive Officer have been impacted. The actual gross death benefit amounts payable under this plan are disclosed under Payments and Benefits in Connection with Termination or Change-in-Control. 
Consideration of Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation. The Company most recently conducted an advisory vote on executive compensation at the 2017 annual Meeting of Shareholders. Votes cast on that advisory proposal indicated a significant level of support in favor of the Company's compensation policies and practices as disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting. Results were favorably comparable to the previous advisory vote on executive compensation which was conducted at the Company's 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As a result of this strong shareholder support, the Board of Directors and the Committee did not believe that any significant changes to the Company's compensation policies and practices were needed to address shareholder concerns. The next shareholder advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation policies and practices will take place at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  2018 Executive Officer Compensation Program. For 2018, the Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table received salaries that were intended to maintain their compensation at a competitive level and acknowledge the competitive market conditions in which the Bank's business continues to be conducted.
To aid in determining chief executive officer compensation for 2018, the Company used compensation data from peer bank holding companies which are similar in size ($614.7 million to $3.16 billion in assets), and geographic locations (located in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan), and which are also publicly held and performing similarly to the Company as one piece of information. Data is obtained from the proxy statements filed by those companies as of the previous year end. This provided a regional comparison in addition to compensation data obtained from other state or national peer comparisons. 
For 2018 executive officer compensation, the President and CEO and the CFO, participated in the presentation portion of the meeting at which compensation information was presented and reviewed. The committee then met in executive session and made its own determinations regarding compensation for the President and CEO and all other executive officers. Adjustments in 2018 base salary were based upon each Named Executive Officer's annual performance review, an annual review of peer compensation, and the overall performance of the Company. These adjustments are consistent with the Company's salary budget which is approved by the Compensation Committee and becomes part of the overall budget approved annually by the Board of Directors.
As part of its compensation program the Company has entered into agreements with some of the Named Executive Officers pursuant to which they will be entitled to receive severance benefits upon the occurrence of certain enumerated events following a change in control. The events that trigger payment are generally those related to termination of employment without cause or detrimental changes in the executive's terms and conditions of employment. See the section captioned "Post-Employment Compensation/Change in Control Agreements" that follows for a more detailed description of these events. The Company believes that this structure will help: (i) assure the executives' full attention and dedication to the Company, free from distractions caused by personal uncertainties and risks related to a pending or threatened change in control, (ii) assure the executives' objectivity for shareholders' interests, (iii) assure the executives of fair treatment in case of involuntary termination following a change in control, and (iv) attract and retain key talent during uncertain times. 
Risk Management and Compensation. The compensation policies and practices of the Company are not believed to create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on operations or financial results. The compensation policies and practices of the Company are not designed to provide enormous bonuses and do not encourage employees to take undue amounts of risk. The incentives provided to employees are designed to encourage sound performance over time rather than the pursuit of immediate high-risk profits. The policies and practices of the Company include controls that mitigate the potential impact of compensation policies that might otherwise create unacceptable levels of risk.

 Post-Employment Compensation/Change in Control Agreements 
The tables below provide a summary of payments to the named executive officers under the Company's compensation arrangements and plans in connection with certain terminations from employment, assuming that the triggering events giving rise to termination occurred on December 31, 2018. 
The Company entered into Change in Control Severance Compensation Agreements with its executive officers, Mr. Siebenmorgen, Ms. Britenriker, Mr. Leininger, and Mr. Rice. These agreements provide for payment of an amount equal to one year's compensation to the executives, or two years compensation for Mr. Siebenmorgen and Ms. Britenriker, in the event that the executive's employment is terminated in connection with a "Change in Control" as defined in the Agreements. No payments will be made in such event if the executive is terminated "for cause."
If a change in control had occurred as of December 31, 2018, this would have resulted in payments to the executives as shown on the following table. In addition to the payment equal to two times their annual salary for Mr. Siebenmorgen and Ms. Britenriker and one times their annual salary for Mr. Leininger and Mr. Rice, the Agreements provide for the continuation of health insurance and other benefits for the remainder of the "Benefit Period," as defined in the Agreements, which amounts are also included in the table. Under the terms of the restricted stock awards, all granted shares would be accelerated to 100% vested and given to the officers. The values of these shares are shown using the market value as of December 31, 2018 at $38.49. 
The Employment Agreement with Lars Eller provides for termination upon the expiration of the designated term provided therein, death, by the Bank for "cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), disability, by the Bank without cause, voluntary termination by Mr. Eller, or in connection with a "change in control" (as defined in the Employment Agreement). Upon termination by the Bank without cause, the Bank would be obligated to pay Mr. Eller one year of compensation, unless the termination were to occur prior to the first anniversary of his hiring (September 18, 2019), in which case he would be entitled to two years of compensation. Such compensation would include his then base pay, any incentives earned to the date of termination, and continued coverage under the Bank's health and dental plan or payment of an amount equal to such benefits. Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, in the event of an involuntary termination following a change in control, Mr. Eller would generally be entitled to receive an amount equal to two times the sum of his then annual base pay and any incentive compensation earned through the date of the change in control. In addition, he would be entitled to continuing coverage under the Bank's health, disability, dental and life insurance at the same levels provided him prior to the change in control, for a period of 12 months after the change in control. 
Also included in the tables are amounts that would be payable to the executive or their estate upon the death of the executive pursuant to individual executive survivor income agreements ("ESIA"). See the section of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis captioned "Components of Compensation—Health and Welfare Benefits" for additional information regarding the ESIA. In addition, all unvested stock awards would also immediately vest upon the death or permanent disability of an executive officer.

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Introduction. The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the president and chief executive officer ("CEO"). The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization. We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform in ways that enhance shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees.
The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our CEO's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to that of all other Company employees for the same period. 
Identification of Median Employee. The Median Employee was identified by examining the Company's payroll records for all individuals, excluding the Company's CEO and the CEO of the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, who were actively employed by the Company on December 31, 2018 (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). As of this date, the Company employed 297 individuals. For such employees, no assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation were made. Wages and salaries were not annualized for those employees that were not employed for the full year of 2018.
Pay Elements. The Company's contribution to the 401(k) profit sharing plan and the medical benefits provided are included as all employees including the CEO are offered the exact same benefits and the Company utilizes the Internal Revenue Service safe harbor provision for 401(k) discrimination testing. Additionally, the Group Term Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits were included as these benefits cover all employees though the benefit would differ based on age and base salary.  The Median Employee identified is not an Officer of the Company and thus is not eligible for all compensation elements available to Officers. As a Director of the Company, Mr. Siebenmorgen is paid director fees separately. And, as a Director of the Company, Mr. Eller's director fees are included in annual base salary. 
Pay elements included in the annual total compensation calculation for each employee include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary received in fiscal year 2018

• Annual incentive payment based on Company performance in fiscal year 2018

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Medical benefits  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Group Term Life Insurance premiums  
[END TABLE]
Pay Ratio Disclosure. Based on the above methodology for determining annual total compensation for comparison purposes, the annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for the Company's CEO was $831,492 (which also included restricted Stock Awards available to Officers), and for the Median Employee was $41,826. The resulting ratio for the Company's CEO pay to the pay of the Median Employee for fiscal year 2018 is 19.88 to 1.0. 
Based on the above methodology for determining annual total compensation for comparison purposes, the annualized total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for the CEO of the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank was $480,833 (which also included a monthly Car Allowance and restricted Stock Awards available to Officers), and for the Median Employee was $41,826. The resulting ratio of the CEO's pay for the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, to the pay of the Median Employee for fiscal year 2018 is 11.50 to 1.0. 
Director Compensation Discussion 
The Compensation Committee reviews the level of compensation of our directors on an annual basis. To determine the appropriateness of the current level of compensation for directors, the committee has historically obtained data from a number of different sources including publicly available data describing director compensation in peer companies and survey data collected by a member of the Compensation Committee. 
At the committee's request, the President and Chief Executive Officer compiled an analysis of director fees and the number of directors from the nine peer bank holding companies also used for comparison of executive officer compensation. The committee reviews this information at least once a year in conjunction with events in the industry and marketplace to determine if any changes or revisions are deemed necessary. 
Cash compensation is paid to directors in the form of retainers and meeting fees. The director fee structure effective January 1, 2018 was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Retainer Fee of $21,000 per year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chairman of the Board Retainer Fee of $24,000 per year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Directors Fee of $750 per board meeting attended;  
[END TABLE]

• Board Committee Chairman Fee of $700 paid to All Board Committee Chairpersons per board committee meeting  attended; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meeting Fees for Other Board Committees of $600 per meeting attended.  
[END TABLE]
Directors participating in a meeting by telephone/video conference call were compensated one-half the meeting fee for that particular meeting. The following table regarding Director Fees Earned or Paid in Cash reflects the fee structure in effect during 2018.  The committee reviewed the director fee structure in November 2018. Based on the size of the Bank and the Bancorp's recent listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange, adjustments to the Board Retainer Fees and Meeting fees were recommended. The following director fee structure became effective January 1, 2019:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Retainer Fee of $25,000 per year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chairman of the Board Retainer Fee of $32,000 per year;

• Directors Fee of $800 per board meeting attended;

• Board Committee Chairman Fee of $700 paid to All Board Committee Chairpersons per board committee meeting  attended; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meeting Fees for Other Board Committees of $600 per board committee meeting attended.  
[END TABLE]
Directors participating in a meeting by telephone/video conference call will continue to be compensated one-half the meeting fee for that particular meeting. Employee directors are not paid for committee meetings. Additionally, reimbursement for out-of-pocket travel expenses will be provided for those Directors residing outside a 60-mile radius of the Corporate Office located in Archbold, Ohio.

Director compensation is intended to retain and help attract appropriate individuals to serve. In consideration of the Company's listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange and based on a Director's increased responsibility and accountability, the committee feels director compensation should be fair and equitable in comparison to peers. In light of the current regulatory focus on the banking industry, increased shareholder and public scrutiny, and the economic times, performance expectations such as wise counsel, strong leadership, and board member involvement through regular board meeting and committee meeting attendance are extremely important and should be appropriately compensated. 
Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for discharging the responsibilities of the Board with respect to the compensation of executive officers. The Compensation Committee sets performance goals and objectives for the President and Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers, evaluates their performance with respect to those goals and sets their compensation based upon the evaluation of their performance. In evaluating executive officer pay, the Compensation Committee may retain the services of a compensation consultant and consider recommendations from the President and Chief Executive Officer with respect to goals and compensation of the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee assesses the information it receives in accordance with its business judgment. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews director compensation. All decisions with respect to executive and director compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee and recommended to the full board for ratification.  The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the disclosures contained in the section of this Proxy Statement captioned – "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" (the "CD&A") with management. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the CD&A be included in the proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Respectfully submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors: 
Kevin J. Sauder, Chairman 
Steven A. Everhart, Jack C. Johnson, Anthony J. Rupp 
Related Party Transactions 
Director Independence 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company undertakes a review of director independence annually and reports on its findings to the full Board in connection with its recommendation of nominees for election to the Board of Directors. Based upon this review, the Board of Directors has determined that all directors have met the independence standards of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, with the exception of Mr. Siebenmorgen, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Company's subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank and Mr. Eller, the current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Farmers & Merchants State Bank, and Mr. Briggs, the First Senior Vice President of Business Development of The Farmers & Merchants State Bank. In determining the independence of the members of the Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board considered the following relationship: 
Steven A. Everhart, who currently serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee, is related indirectly by marriage to Marilyn Johnson, Vice President and Compliance Manager of the Bank, who is not deemed to be an "executive officer" of the Bank or Company. 
Transactions with Related Parties 
Certain directors, nominees, and executive officers or their associates were customers of and had transactions with the Company or its subsidiary during 2018. Transactions that involved loans or commitments by the Bank were made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. No director, executive officer or beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Company's outstanding voting securities (or any member of their immediate families) engaged in any transaction (other than loan transactions in the ordinary course as described) with the Company during 2018 or proposes to engage in any transaction with the Company, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Company's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct requires that all related party transactions be pre-approved by the Company's Audit Committee. Exemptions from that pre-approval requirement are routine banking transactions, including deposit and loan transactions, between our subsidiary and any related party that are made in compliance with, and subject to the approvals required by, all federal and state banking regulations. In making a determination to approve a related party transaction the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the proposed transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company than those generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the proposed transaction.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
In 2018 the Compensation Committee members were Kevin J. Sauder, Chairman, Steven A. Everhart, Jack Johnson, and Anthony Rupp. No member of the Board's Compensation Committee is, or has been, an officer or employee of the Company, or has had any relationship with the Company or the Bank requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, no executive officer of the Company or the Bank serves or has served as a member of the Compensation Committee or Board of Directors of any other company (other than the Bank) which employs any member of the Company's Board of Directors. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company, the Company believes that during 2018 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers and directors were met. 
Proposals of Shareholders for Next Annual Meeting 
Proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting must be received at the Company's offices at 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502, prior to November 16, 2019 for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy. Proposals from shareholders for next year's Annual Meeting received by the Company after January 30, 2020 will be considered untimely. With respect to such proposals, the Company will vote all shares for which it has received proxies in the interest of the Company as determined in the sole discretion of its Board of Directors. The Company also retains its authority to discretionarily vote proxies with respect to shareholder proposals received by the Company after November 16, 2019 but prior to January 30, 2020, unless the proposing shareholder takes the necessary steps outlined in Rule 14a-4(c)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to ensure the proper delivery of proxy materials related to the proposal. 
Other Matters 
The Board of Directors does not know of any other matters that are likely to be brought before the meeting. However, in the event that any other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy will vote said proxy in accordance with their judgment on such matters. 
A copy of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 is enclosed. A copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, with exhibits, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("2018 10-K"), is available to any shareholder free of charge. Shareholders desiring a copy of the 2018 10-K should address written requests to Ms. Barbara J. Britenriker, Chief Financial Officer of Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 307 North Defiance Street, Archbold, Ohio 43502, and are asked to mark "2018 10-K Request" on the outside of the envelope containing the request.
