  PROXY STATEMENT
The accompanying proxy is solicited by CEL-SCI's directors for voting at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 20, 2019, and at any and all adjournments of such meeting. If the proxy is executed and returned, it will be voted at the meeting in accordance with any instructions, and if no specification is made, the proxy will be voted for the proposals set forth in the accompanying notice of the annual meeting of shareholders. Shareholders who execute proxies may revoke them at any time before they are voted, either by writing to CEL-SCI at the address shown above or in person at the time of the meeting. Additionally, any later dated proxy will revoke a previous proxy from the same shareholder. This proxy statement was posted on the CEL-SCI's website on or about March 26, 2019.
There is one class of capital stock outstanding. Provided a quorum consisting of one-third of the shares entitled to vote is present at the meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock voting in person or represented by proxy is required to elect directors. Cumulative voting in the election of directors is not permitted. The other proposals to come before the meeting will be adopted if votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast against the proposal.
Shares of CEL-SCI's common stock represented by properly executed proxies that reflect abstentions or "broker non-votes" will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the annual meeting. "Broker non-votes" represent shares held by brokerage firms in "street-name" with respect to which the broker has not received instructions from the customer or otherwise does not have discretionary voting authority. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as having voted against the proposals to be considered at the meeting.
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file within four business days after the Annual Meeting.  PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS

CEL-SCI's nominating committee, consisting of Mr. Baillavoine, Dr. Young and Mr. Watson, has nominated Geert R. Kersten, Peter R. Young, Bruno Baillavoine and Robert Watson to stand for election as directors at the annual meeting. Unless the proxy contains contrary instructions, it is intended that the proxies will be voted for the election of the nominees to the board of directors. In case any nominee shall be unable or shall fail to act as a director by virtue of an unexpected occurrence, the proxies may be voted for such other person or persons as shall be determined by the persons acting under the proxies in their discretion. All nominees to the board of directors have consented to stand for election. CEL-SCI's Nominating Committee Charter can be reviewed at CEL-SCI's website: https://cel-sci.com/new-investor-information/. CEL-SCI does not have any policy regarding the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders since a shareholder has never recommended a nominee to the Board of Directors and under Colorado law, any shareholder can nominate a person for election as a director at the annual shareholders' meeting. However, CEL-SCI's nominating committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders. To submit a candidate for the Board of Directors the shareholder should send the name, address and telephone number of the candidate, together with any relevant background or biographical information, to Dr. Peter Young at the address shown on the cover page of this proxy statement. CEL-SCI's nominating committee has not established any specific qualifications or skills a nominee must meet to serve as a director. Although CEL-SCI does not have any process for identifying and evaluating director nominees, CEL-SCI does not believe there would be any differences in the manner in which CEL-SCI evaluates nominees submitted by shareholders as opposed to nominees submitted by any other person.
CEL-SCI's Board of Directors does not have a "leadership structure", as such, since each director is entitled to introduce resolutions to be considered by the Board and each director is entitled to one vote on any resolution considered by the Board. CEL-SCI's Chief Executive Officer is not the Chairman of CEL-SCI's Board of Directors.
CEL-SCI's Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility to evaluate and respond to risks facing CEL-SCI. CEL-SCI's Board of Directors fulfills its obligations in this regard by meeting on a regular basis and communicating, when necessary, with CEL-SCI's officers.
Peter R. Young, Bruno Baillavoine and Robert Watson are independent as that term is defined in section 803 of the listing standards of the NYSE American.
CEL-SCI's Board of Directors met 5 times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. All of the Directors attended these meetings, either in person or by telephone conference call. In addition, the Board of Directors had a number of informal telephonic meetings during the course of the year.
CEL-SCI has adopted a Code of Ethics which is applicable to CEL-SCI'S principal executive, financial, and accounting officers and persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics is available on CEL-SCI's website, located at https://cel-sci.com/new-investor-information/.
If a violation of this code of ethics act is discovered or suspected, the person suspecting the violation should (anonymously, if desired) send a detailed note, with relevant documents, to CEL-SCI's Audit Committee, c/o Dr. Peter Young, 208 Hewitt Drive, Suite 103-143, Waco, TX 76712.
CEL-SCI does not have a policy with regard to Board member's attendance at annual meetings. All Board members attended the last annual shareholder's meeting held on September 20, 2018.
Holders of CEL-SCI's common stock can send written communications to CEL-SCI's entire Board of Directors, or to one or more Board members, by addressing the communication to "the Board of Directors" or to one or more directors, specifying the director or directors by name, and sending the communication to CEL-SCI's offices in Vienna, Virginia. Communications addressed to the Board of Directors as whole will be delivered to each Board member. Communications addressed to a specific director (or directors) will be delivered to the director (or directors) specified.
Security holder communications sent to specified Board members and not sent to the Board of Directors as a whole are not relayed to other Board members.  Executive Compensation
 Components of Compensation - Executive Officers
CEL-SCI's executive officers are compensated through the following three components:
 Base Salary
 Long-Term Incentives (stock options and/or grants of stock)
 Benefits
These components provide a balanced mix of base compensation and compensation that is contingent upon each executive officer's individual performance. A goal of the compensation program is to provide executive officers with a reasonable level of security through base salary and benefits. CEL-SCI wants to ensure that the compensation programs are appropriately designed to encourage executive officer retention and motivation to create shareholder value. The Compensation Committee believes that CEL-SCI's stockholders are best served when CEL-SCI can attract and retain talented executives by providing compensation packages that are competitive but fair.
 Base Salaries
Base salaries generally have been targeted to be competitive when compared to the salary levels of persons holding similar positions in other pharmaceutical companies and other publicly traded companies of comparable size. Each executive officer's respective responsibilities, experience, expertise and individual performance are considered.
A further consideration in establishing compensation for the senior employees is their long term history with CEL-SCI. Taken into consideration are factors that have helped CEL-SCI survive in times when it was financially weak, such as: willingness to accept salary cuts, willingness not to be paid at all for extended time periods, and in general an attitude that helped CEL-SCI survive during financially difficult times.
 Long-Term Incentives
Stock grants and option grants help to align the interests of CEL-SCI's employees with those of its shareholders.  Options and stock grants are made under CEL-SCI's Stock Option, Incentive Stock Bonus, Stock Bonus and Stock Compensation Plans.  Options are granted with exercise prices equal to the closing price of CEL-SCI's common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant, with pro rata vesting at the end of each of the following three years.  
CEL-SCI believes that grants of equity-based compensation:
 Enhance the link between the creation of shareholder value and long-term executive incentive compensation;
 Provide focus, motivation and retention incentive; and
 Provide competitive levels of total compensation.
 Benefits
In addition to cash and equity compensation programs, executive officers participate in the health and welfare benefit programs available to other employees. In a few limited circumstances, CEL-SCI provides other benefits to certain executive officers, such as car allowances.
All executive officers are eligible to participate in CEL-SCI's 401(k) plan on the same basis as its other employees. CEL-SCI matches 100% of each employee's contribution up to 6% of his or her salary.  Compensation Table
The following table sets forth in summary form the compensation received by (i) the Chief Executive and Financial Officer of CEL-SCI and (ii) by each other executive officer of CEL-SCI who received in excess of $100,000 during either of the two fiscal years ended September 30, 2018.

CEL-SCI has a defined contribution retirement plan, qualifying under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and covering substantially all CEL-SCI's employees. CEL-SCI's contribution to the plan is made in shares of CEL-SCI's common stock. Each participant's contribution is matched by CEL-SCI with shares of common stock which have a value equal to 100% of the participant's contribution, not to exceed the lesser of $1,000 or 6% of the participant's total compensation. CEL-SCI's contribution of common stock is valued each quarter based upon the closing price of its common stock. The fiscal 2018 expenses for this plan were approximately $144,000. Other than the 401(k) Plan, CEL-SCI does not have a defined benefit, pension plan, profit sharing or other retirement plan.

 Employment Contracts
 Geert Kersten
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Geert Kersten, CEL-SCI's Chief Executive Officer. The employment agreement with Mr. Kersten, which is essentially the same as Mr. Kersten's prior employment agreement, as amended on August 30, 2013, provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Mr. Kersten an annual salary of $559,052, plus any increases in proportion to salary increases granted to other senior executive officers of CEL-SCI, as well any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the term of the employment agreement.
During the employment term, Mr. Kersten will be entitled to receive any other benefits which are provided to CEL-SCI's executive officers or other full time employees in accordance with CEL-SCI's policies and practices and subject to Mr. Kersten's satisfaction of any applicable conditions of eligibility.
If Mr. Kersten resigns within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a reduction in Mr. Kersten's salary (ii) a relocation (or demand for relocation) of Mr. Kersten's place of employment to a location more than ten (10) miles from his current place of employment, (iii) a significant and material reduction in Mr. Kersten's authority, job duties or level of responsibility or the imposition of significant and material limitations on the Mr. Kersten's autonomy in his position, or (iv) a Change in Control, then the employment agreement will be terminated and Mr. Kersten will be entitled to receive a lump-sum payment from CEL-SCI equal to 24 months of salary ($1,118,104) and the unvested portion of any stock options would vest immediately. For purposes of the employment agreement a change in the control of CEL-SCI means: (1) the merger of CEL-SCI with another entity if after such merger the shareholders of CEL-SCI do not own at least 50% of voting capital stock of the surviving corporation; (2) the sale of substantially all of the assets of CEL-SCI; (3) the acquisition by any person of more than 50% of CEL-SCI's common stock; or (4) a change in a majority of CEL-SCI's directors which has not been approved by the incumbent directors. The employment agreement will also terminate upon the death of Mr. Kersten or Mr. Kersten's physical or mental disability.
If the employment agreement is terminated for any of these reasons, Mr. Kersten, or his legal representatives, as the case may be, will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination, any options or bonus shares of CEL-SCI then held by Mr. Kersten will become fully vested and the expiration date of any options which would expire during the four year period following his termination of employment will be extended to the date which is four years after his termination of employment. The employment agreement will also terminate upon the willful misconduct, an act of fraud against CEL-SCI, or a breach of the employment agreement by Mr. Kersten, in which case Mr. Kersten will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination.
 Patricia B. Prichep / Eyal Talor, Ph.D.
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Patricia B. Prichep, CEL-SCI's Senior Vice President of Operations. The employment agreement with Ms. Prichep, which is essentially the same as Ms. Prichep's prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2013 provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Ms. Prichep an annual salary of $245,804 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Eyal Talor, Ph.D., CEL-SCI's Chief Scientific Officer. The employment agreement with Dr. Talor, which is essentially the same as Dr. Talor's prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2013, provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Dr. Talor an annual salary of $303,453 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.
If Ms. Prichep or Dr. Talor resigns within ninety (90) days of the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a relocation (or demand for relocation) of employee's place of employment to a location more than ten (10) miles from the employee's current place of employment, (ii) a significant and material reduction in the employee's authority, job duties or level of responsibility or (iii) the imposition of significant and material limitations on the employee's autonomy in her or his position, the employment agreement will be terminated and the employee will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination and the unvested portion of any stock options held by the employee will vest immediately.
In the event there is a change in the control of CEL-SCI, the employment agreements with Ms. Prichep and Dr. Talor allow Ms. Prichep and/or Dr. Talor (as the case may be) to resign from her or his position at CEL-SCI and receive a lump-sum payment from CEL-SCI equal to 18 months of salary ($368,706 and $455,180 respectively). In addition, the unvested portion of any stock options held by the employee will vest immediately. For purposes of the employment agreements, a change in the control of CEL-SCI means: (1) the merger of CEL-SCI with another entity if after such merger the shareholders of CEL-SCI do not own at least 50% of voting capital stock of the surviving corporation; (2) the sale of substantially all of the assets of CEL-SCI; (3) the acquisition by any person of more than 50% of CEL-SCI's common stock; or (4) a change in a majority of CEL-SCI's directors which has not been approved by the incumbent directors.
The employment agreements with Ms. Prichep and Dr. Talor will also terminate upon the death of the employee, the employee's physical or mental disability, willful misconduct, an act of fraud against CEL-SCI, or a breach of the employment agreement by the employee. If the employment agreement is terminated for any of these reasons the employee, or her or his legal representatives, as the case may be, will be paid the salary provided by the employment agreement through the date of termination.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
CEL-SCI has a compensation committee comprised of Mr. Bruno Baillavoine Dr. Peter Young and Mr. Watson, all of whom are independent directors.
During the year ended September 30, 2018, no director of CEL-SCI was also an executive officer of another entity, which had an executive officer of CEL-SCI serving as a director of such entity or as a member of the compensation committee of such entity.
 Stock Option, Bonus and Compensation Plans
CEL-SCI has Incentive Stock Option Plans, Non-Qualified Stock Option, Stock Bonus Plans, Stock Compensation Plans and an Incentive Stock Bonus Plan. All Stock Option, Bonus and Compensation Plans have been approved by the stockholders. A summary description of these Plans follows. In some cases these Plans are collectively referred to as the "Plans".
Incentive Stock Option Plan. The Incentive Stock Option Plans authorize the issuance of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to persons who exercise options granted pursuant to the Plans. Only CEL-SCI's employees may be granted options pursuant to the Incentive Stock Option Plans.
Options may not be exercised until one year following the date of grant. Options granted to an employee then owning more than 10% of the common stock of CEL-SCI may not be exercisable by its terms after five years from the date of grant. Any other option granted pursuant to the Plans may not be exercisable by its terms after ten years from the date of grant.
The purchase price per share of common stock purchasable under an option is determined by CEL-SCI's Compensation Committee but cannot be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant of the option (or 110% of the fair market value in the case of a person owning more than 10% of CEL-SCI's outstanding shares).
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans. The Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans authorize the issuance of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to persons that exercise options granted pursuant to the Plans. CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors are eligible to be granted options pursuant to the Plans, provided however that bona fide services must be rendered by such consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCI's common stock. The option exercise price is determined by CEL-SCI's Compensation Committee.
Stock Bonus Plan. Under the Stock Bonus Plans, shares of CEL-SCI's common stock may be issued to CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors, provided however that bona fide services must be rendered by consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCI's common stock.
Stock Compensation Plan. Under the Stock Compensation Plan, shares of CEL-SCI's common stock may be issued to CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants and advisors in payment of salaries, fees and other compensation owed to these persons. However, bona fide services must be rendered by consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCI's common stock.
Incentive Stock Bonus Plan. Under the 2014 Incentive Stock Bonus Plan, shares of CEL-SCI's common stock may be issued to executive officers and other employees who contribute significantly to the success of CEL-SCI. The purpose of the Plan is to provide long term incentive for outstanding service to CEL-SCI and its shareholders and to assist in recruiting and retaining people of outstanding ability and initiative in executive and management positions. Other Information Regarding the Plans. The Plans are administered by CEL-SCI's Compensation Committee ("the Committee"), each member of which is a director of CEL-SCI. The members of the Committee were selected by CEL-SCI's Board of Directors and serve for a one-year tenure and until their successors are elected. A member of the Committee may be removed at any time by action of the Board of Directors. Any vacancies which may occur on the Committee will be filled by the Board of Directors. The Committee is vested with the authority to interpret the provisions of the Plans and supervise the administration of the Plans. In addition, the Committee is empowered to select those persons to whom shares or options are to be granted, to determine the number of shares subject to each grant of a stock bonus or an option and to determine when, and upon what conditions, shares or options granted under the Plans will vest or otherwise be subject to forfeiture and cancellation.
In the discretion of the Committee, any option granted pursuant to the Plans may include installment exercise terms such that the option becomes fully exercisable in a series of cumulating portions. The Committee may also accelerate the date upon which any option (or any part of any options) is first exercisable. Any shares issued pursuant to the Stock Bonus Plans or Stock Compensation Plan and any options granted pursuant to the Incentive Stock Option Plans or the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plans will be forfeited if the "vesting" schedule established by the Committee administering the Plans at the time of the grant is not met. For this purpose, vesting means the period during which the employee must remain an employee of CEL-SCI or the period of time a non-employee must provide services to CEL-SCI. At the time an employee ceases working for CEL-SCI (or at the time a non-employee ceases to perform services for CEL-SCI), any shares or options not fully vested will be forfeited and cancelled. At the discretion of the Committee payment for the shares of common stock underlying options may be paid through the delivery of shares of CEL-SCI's common stock having an aggregate fair market value equal to the option price, provided such shares have been owned by the option holder for at least one year prior to such exercise. A combination of cash and shares of common stock may also be permitted at the discretion of the Committee.
Options are generally non-transferable except upon death of the option holder. Shares issued pursuant to the Stock Bonus Plans will generally not be transferable until the person receiving the shares satisfies the vesting requirements imposed by the Committee when the shares were issued.
The Board of Directors of CEL-SCI may at any time, and from time to time, amend, terminate, or suspend one or more of the Plans in any manner it deems appropriate, provided that such amendment, termination or suspension will not adversely affect rights or obligations with respect to shares or options previously granted.

 Compensation Committee
During the year ending September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI had a Compensation Committee which was comprised of Peter Young, Bruno Baillavoine and Robert Watson. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee formerly met on one occasion.
The following is the report of the Compensation Committee:
The key components of CEL-SCI's executive compensation program include annual base salaries and long-term incentive compensation consisting of stock options. It is CEL-SCI's policy to target compensation (i.e., base salary, stock option grants and other benefits) at approximately the median of comparable companies in the biotechnology field. Accordingly, data on compensation practices followed by other companies in the biotechnology industry is considered.
CEL-SCI's long-term incentive program formerly consisted of periodic grants of stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of CEL-SCI's common stock at the close of the previous trading day. To encourage retention, the ability to exercise options granted under the program was subject to vesting restrictions. Decisions made regarding the timing and size of option grants took into account the performance of both CEL-SCI and the employee, "competitive market" practices, and the size of the option grants made in prior years. The weighting of these factors varied and was subjective.
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Geert Kersten, CEL-SCI's Chief Executive Officer. The employment agreement with Mr. Kersten, which is essentially the same as Mr. Kersten's prior employment agreement, as amended on August 30, 2013, provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Mr. Kersten an annual salary of $559,052, plus any increases in proportion to salary increases granted to other senior executive officers of CEL-SCI, as well any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Patricia B. Prichep, CEL-SCI's Senior Vice President of Operations. The employment agreement with Ms. Prichep, which is essentially the same as Ms. Prichep's prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2013 provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Ms. Prichep an annual salary of $245,804 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement.
On August 31, 2016, CEL-SCI entered into a three-year employment agreement with Eyal Talor, Ph.D., CEL-SCI's Chief Scientific Officer. The employment agreement with Dr. Talor, which is essentially the same as Dr. Talor's prior employment agreement entered into on August 30, 2013, provided that, during the term of the agreement, CEL-SCI would pay Dr. Talor an annual salary of $303,453 plus any increases approved by the Board of Directors during the period of the employment agreement. During the year ending September 30, 2018, the compensation paid to CEL-SCI's other executive officers was based on a variety of factors, including the performance in the executive's area of responsibility, the executive's individual performance, the executive's experience in his or her role, the executive's length of service with CEL-SCI, the achievement of specific goals established for CEL-SCI and its business, and, in certain instances, to the achievement of individual goals.
Financial or stockholder value performance comparisons were not used to determine the compensation of CEL-SCI's other executive officers since CEL-SCI's financial performance and stockholder value are influenced to a substantial degree by external factors and as a result comparing the compensation payable to the other executive officers to CEL-SCI's financial or stock price performance can be misleading.
During the year ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI granted options for the purchase of 1,321,203 shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to CEL-SCI's executive officers. In granting the options to CEL-SCI's executive officers, the Board of Directors considered the same factors which were used to determine the cash compensation paid to such officers.
Except as otherwise disclosed in this proxy statement, during the year ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI did not issue any shares of its common stock to its officers or directors in return for services provided to CEL-SCI.
The foregoing report has been approved by the members of the Compensation Committee:
Peter Young
Bruno Baillavoine
Robert Watson
CEL-SCI's Compensation Committee Charter can be reviewed at CEL-SCI's website: https://cel-sci.com/new-investor-information/#corporategovernance.
 Audit Committee
During the year ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI had an Audit Committee comprised of Peter Young, Bruno Baillavoine and Robert Watson. All members of the Audit Committee were independent as defined by Section 803 of the NYSE American Listing Standards. Dr. Young serves as the audit committee's financial expert. The purpose of the Audit Committee is to review and approve the selection of CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm and review CEL-SCI's financial statements with CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Audit Committee met eight times. All the members of the Audit Committee attended these meetings.
The following is the report of the Audit Committee:
(1) 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed CEL-SCI's audited financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018 with CEL-SCI's management.
(2) 
The Audit Committee discussed with CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) Standard No. 16 "Communication with Audit Committees".
(3) 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm required by PCAOB independence standards, and had discussed with CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence; and (4) 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in CEL-SCI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(5) 
During the year ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI paid BDO USA, LLP, CEL-SCI's independent registered public accounting firm, fees for professional services rendered for the audit of CEL-SCI's annual financial statements and the reviews of the financial statements included in CEL-SCI's 10-Q reports for the fiscal year and all regulatory filings. The Audit Committee is of the opinion that these fees are consistent with BDO USA, LLP maintaining its independence from CEL-SCI.
The foregoing report has been approved by the members of the Audit Committee:
Peter Young
Bruno Baillavoine
Robert Watson
CEL-SCI's Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. CEL-SCI's Audit Committee Charter can be reviewed at CEL-SCI's website: https://cel-sci.com/new-investor-information/#corporategovernance.
 PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE ADOPTION OF THE
 2019 NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN
Shareholders are being requested to approve the adoption of CEL-SCI's 2019 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan. CEL-SCI's employees, directors, officers, consultants, and advisors are eligible to be granted options pursuant to the 2019 Non-Qualified Plan as may be determined by CEL-SCI's Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, provided however that bona fide services must be rendered by consultants or advisors and such services must not be in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction or promoting CEL-SCI's common stock.
The 2019 Non-Qualified Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 3,000,000 shares of CEL-SCI's common stock to persons that exercise options granted pursuant to the Plan. As of March 26, 2019, CEL-SCI had not granted any options to purchase shares of common stock under the 2019 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan. 
The 2019 Non-Qualified Plan will function and be administered in the same manner as CEL-SCI's 2018 Non-Qualified Plan, including provisions providing that any options granted pursuant to the 2019 Plan must have a minimum vesting period of one year and the exercise price of any options granted pursuant to 2019 Plan may not be changed, except in the case of stock splits, reorganizations or recapitalizations. There are no provisions requiring CEL-SCI to pay cash for an option under any circumstances. The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of CEL-SCI approve the adoption of the 2019 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan.
 PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE ADOPTION OF THE
 2019 STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN
During the two years ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI issued 0 and 13,000 shares of its common stock, respectively, to its officers, directors and employees. During the two years ended September 30, 2018, CEL-SCI issued 0 and 219,984 shares, respectively, to consultants for payment of services of $0 and $60,264. To conserve cash, CEL-SCI expects that it may continue to offer its officers, directors, employees and consultants the opportunity to receive shares of CEL-SCI's common stock in payment of amounts owed by CEL-SCI for services rendered.
So that CEL-SCI may continue to offer shares of its common stock in payment of compensation owed, CEL-SCI's Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval, has adopted the 2019 Stock Compensation Plan. The 2019 Stock Compensation Plan is virtually identical to CEL-SCI's 2015 Stock Compensation Plan which expired on December 31, 2017. Up to 500,000 shares of common stock would be available for issuance under the Plan. The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of CEL-SCI approve the adoption of the 2019 Stock Compensation Plan.  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors has selected BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the books and records of CEL-SCI for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. A representative of BDO USA, LLP is expected to be present at the shareholders' meeting.
BDO USA, LLP served as CEL-SCI's auditors for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The following table shows the aggregate fees billed to CEL-SCI during these years by BDO USA, LLP:

[END TABLE]
Audit fees represent amounts billed for professional services rendered for the audit of CEL-SCI's annual financial statements and the reviews of the financial statements included in CEL-SCI's 10-Q reports for the fiscal year and all regulatory filings. Before BDO USA, LLP was engaged by CEL-SCI to render audit or non-audit services, the engagement was approved by CEL-SCI's audit committee. CEL-SCI's Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Audit Fees charged by BDO USA, LLP are consistent with BDO USA, LLP maintaining its independence from CEL-SCI.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of CEL-SCI approve its selection of BDO USA, LLP as CEL-SCI's independent public accounting firm to audit the books and records of CEL-SCI for the year ending September 30, 2019.
 AVAILABILITY OF ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
