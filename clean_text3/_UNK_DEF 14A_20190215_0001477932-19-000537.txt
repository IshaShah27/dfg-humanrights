Proxy Statement for the Annual General Meeting of Stockholders
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of our Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual General Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on March 15, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. (local time) at 2700‑700 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V7Y 1B8, or at any continuation, postponement or adjournment thereof, for the purposes discussed in this proxy statement and in the accompanying Notice of Annual General Meeting and any business properly brought before the Meeting. Proxies are solicited to give all stockholders of record an opportunity to vote on matters properly presented at the Meeting. We intend to mail this proxy statement and accompanying proxy card on or about February 15, 2019 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Meeting. The date of this proxy statement is February 15, 2019 and, unless otherwise stated, the information contained herein is as of February 15, 2019 
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "we", "us" "our" and "Pivot" refer to Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Who Can Vote
You are entitled to vote if you were a holder of record of Common Shares, (the "Common Shares") as of the close of business on February 13, 2019 (the "Record Date"). Your shares can be voted at the Meeting only if you are present in person or represented by a valid proxy.
Shares Outstanding and Quorum
Holders of record of Common Shares at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Meeting. At the Meeting, each of the Common Shares represented will be entitled to one (1) vote on each matter properly brought before the Meeting. As of February 13, 2019, the record date, there were 96,899,678 Common Shares issued and outstanding.
In order to carry on the business of the Meeting, we must have a quorum. Under our bylaws, a quorum is two persons, present and being, or representing by proxy, members holding at least five percent (5%) of the shares which may be voted at the Meeting.
Proxy Card and Revocation of Proxy
In voting, please specify your choices by marking the appropriate spaces on the enclosed proxy card, signing and dating the proxy card and returning it in the accompanying envelope. The persons named as proxy holder in the accompanying form of proxy were designated by the management of Pivot ("Management Proxy holder"). A shareholder desiring to appoint some other person ("Alternate Proxy holder") to represent him or her at the Meeting may do so by inserting such other person's name in the space indicated or by completing another proper form of proxy. A person appointed as proxy holder need not be a shareholder of Pivot. If no directions are given and the signed proxy is returned, the proxy holders will vote the shares in favor of Proposals 1 through 3 and, at their discretion, on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting. The Board knows of no other business that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. In addition, since no stockholder proposals or nominations were received by us on a timely basis, no such matters may be brought at the Meeting.
Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke the proxy at any time before the proxy is voted. In addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy may be revoked by an instrument in writing executed by the stockholder or by his attorney authorized in writing, or, if the stockholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal or by an officer or attorney thereof duly authorized, and deposited at the offices of our transfer agent, National Issuer Services Ltd., 777 Hornby Street, Suite 760, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6Z 1S4, not less than forty‑eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, before the time of the Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, unless the chairman of the Meeting elects to exercise his discretion to accept proxies received subsequently. Attendance at the Meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy. 
Voting of Shares
Stockholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to one (1) vote for each Common Share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Meeting. You may vote in person or by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card. All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly executed proxies received before the polls are closed at the Meeting, and not revoked or superseded, will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. 
Deadline for Shareholder Proposals
The deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal for inclusion in Pivot's proxy statement and form of proxy for its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a‑8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act") is September 15, 2019, provided, however, that in the event Pivot holds its 2020 annual meeting more than 30 days before or after the one year anniversary date of the Meeting, Pivot will disclose the new deadline by which proxies must be received under Item 5 of Pivot's earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q or, if impracticable, by any means reasonably calculated to inform stockholders. In addition, stockholder proposals must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a‑8 of the Exchange Act.
Any stockholders who wish to submit a proposal are encouraged to seek independent counsel about the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") requirements. Pivot will not consider any proposals that do not meet the SEC requirements for submitting a proposal. Notice of intention to present proposals for Pivot's next annual meeting should be delivered to Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1275 West 6th Avenue, Unit 300, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6H 1A6, Attention: Moira Ong, Corporate Secretary.
ADVICE TO BENEFICIAL HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES
THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION IS OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE TO MANY STOCKHOLDERS OF OUR COMPANY, AS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF STOCKHOLDERS DO NOT HOLD SHARES IN THEIR OWN NAME.
Stockholders who do not hold their shares in their own name (referred to in this Proxy Statement as "beneficial stockholders") should note that only proxies deposited by stockholders whose names appear on the records of our company as the registered holders of Common Shares can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting. If the Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to a stockholder by a broker, then in almost all cases those Common Shares will not be registered in the stockholder's name on the records of our company. Such Common Shares will more likely be registered under the names of the stockholder's broker or an agent of that broker. In the United States, the vast majority of such shares are registered under the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for The Depository Trust Company (which acts as depository for many U.S. brokerage firms and custodian banks), and in Canada, under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited, which acts as nominee and custodian for many Canadian brokerage firms). Beneficial stockholders should ensure that instructions respecting the voting of their Common Shares are communicated to the appropriate person, as without specific instructions, brokers/nominees are prohibited from voting shares for their clients.
Applicable regulatory policy requires intermediaries/brokers to seek voting instructions from beneficial stockholders in advance of stockholders' meetings, unless the beneficial stockholders have waived the right to receive meeting materials. Every intermediary/broker has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by beneficial stockholders in order to ensure that their Common Shares are voted at the Meeting. The Form of Proxy supplied to a beneficial stockholder by its broker (or the agent of the broker) is similar to the Form of Proxy provided to registered stockholders by our company. However, its purpose is limited to instructing the registered stockholder (the broker or agent of the broker) how to vote on behalf of the beneficial stockholder. The majority of brokers now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from clients to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") (formerly, ADP Investor Communication Services in the United States and Independent Investor Communications Company in Canada). Broadridge typically applies a special sticker to proxy forms, mails those forms to the beneficial stockholders and the beneficial stockholders return the proxy forms to Broadridge. Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of shares to be represented at the Meeting. A beneficial stockholder receiving a Broadridge proxy cannot use that proxy to vote Common Shares directly at the Meeting - the proxy must be returned to Broadridge well in advance of the Meeting in order to have the Common Shares voted.
Although a beneficial stockholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting Common Shares registered in the name of his broker (or agent of the broker), a beneficial stockholder may attend at our Meeting as proxyholder for the registered stockholder and vote the Common Shares in that capacity. Beneficial stockholders who wish to attend at the Meeting and indirectly vote their Common Shares as proxyholder for the registered stockholder should enter their own names in the blank space on the instrument of proxy provided to them and return the same to their broker (or the broker's agent) in accordance with the instructions provided by such broker (or agent), well in advance of the Meeting.
Alternatively, a beneficial stockholder may request in writing that his or her broker send to the beneficial stockholder a legal proxy which would enable the beneficial stockholder to attend at the Meeting and vote his or her Common Shares.
There are two kinds of beneficial owners – those who object to their name being made known to the issuers of securities which they own (called OBOs for Objecting Beneficial Owners) and those who do not object to the issuers of the securities they own knowing who they are (called NOBOs for Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners). Pursuant to National Instrument 54-101, issuers can obtain a list of their NOBOs from intermediaries for distribution of proxy-related materials directly to NOBOs.
We will be sending proxy-related materials directly to non-objecting beneficial owners under NI 54-101.
We do not intend to pay for intermediaries to forward to objecting beneficial owners under NI 54-101 the proxy-related materials and Form 54-101F7 – Request for Voting Instructions Made by Intermediary, and that in the case of an objecting beneficial owner, the objecting beneficial owner will not receive the materials unless the objecting beneficial owner's intermediary assumes the cost of delivery.
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.
Counting of Votes
All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes and abstentions. Shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions as to a particular proposal will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. An abstention is counted as a vote against that proposal. Shares represented by proxies that reflect a broker "non-vote" will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker "non-vote" will be treated as not-voted for purposes of determining approval of a proposal and will not be counted as "for" or "against" that proposal. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary authority or does not have instructions from the beneficial owner.
Solicitation of Proxies
We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly and mailing of this proxy statement, the proxy and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, depositories, fiduciaries and custodians holding Common Shares in their names that are beneficially owned by others to forward to these beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners for their costs of forwarding the solicitation material to the beneficial owners of the Common Shares. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for such services. To date, we have not incurred costs in connection with the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders, however, our estimate for total costs is $8,000.
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN OR OPPOSITION TO MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON

Information About the Board of Directors
Board and Committee Meetings
All proceedings of the board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and our Articles, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held.
Audit Committee
Our audit committee consists of Dr. Joseph Borovsky, Dr. Wolfgang Renz and Dr. Patrick Frankham.
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
Our board of directors has determined that none of the members of our audit committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
We believe that the members of our board of audit committee and our entire board of directors are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating, compensation or other committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.
Nominating Committee
We do not have a Nominating Committee, our entire board of director performs the functions of a Nominating Committee and oversees the process by which individuals may be nominated to our board of directors.
The current size of our board of directors does not facilitate the establishment of a separate committee. We hope to establish a separate Nominating Committee consisting of independent directors, if the number of our directors is expanded.
Compensation Committee
We do not have a compensation committee, our entire board of director performs the functions of a Compensation Committee and oversees the process by which our named executive officers and directors are compensated.
Family Relationships
There are no other family relationships between any of our other directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:
Code of Ethics
Effective April 20, 2011, our company's board of directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors, our company's officers including our president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, employees, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires, among other things, that all of our company's Senior Officers commit to timely, accurate and consistent disclosure of information; that they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity.
In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly Senior Officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by another.
The Code was included as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 11, 2011. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1275 West 6th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia V6H 1A6.
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Accordingly, our officers, directors, and principal stockholders are not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Transactions with Related Director
Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer or any family member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended January 31, 2018, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year end for the last three completed fiscal years.
Transactions with Shareholder Holding at Least 5% of our Common Shares
Subsequent to the year ended January 31, 2018, Ahmad Doroudian, who is a shareholder holding at least 5% of our common shares, purchased 375,000 units of our company at CDN$0.40 per unit, each unit consisting of one (1) common share and one (1) share purchase warrant entitling the holder to purchase one common share at a price of CDN$0.60 per share and with an expiry term of three (3) years.
Director Independence
We currently act with three directors, consisting of Dr. Joseph Borovsky, Dr. Wolfgang Renz, and Dr. Patrick Frankham. Dr. Wolfgang Renz qualifies as an "independent director" as defined in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15). 
PROPOSAL NO. 3 - RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of MNP, LLP as our independent auditor is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, our board of directors is submitting the selection of MNP, LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, our board of directors will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, our board of directors in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if our board of directors determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and its stockholders. 
Our board of directors has considered and determined that the services provided by MNP, LLP are compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.
Representatives of MNP, LLP are not expected to be present at the Meeting.
Our board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of MNP, LLP as our independent auditors for the ensuing fiscal year.
The following table sets forth the fees billed to the company for professional services rendered by the company's predecessor independent registered public accounting firm, Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC, for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Services     2018 US$        2017 US$    
 Services     2018 US$        2017 US$

 Audit related fees     Nil        Nil    
 All other fees     Nil        Nil    
 Total fees       25,000          24,000    
[END TABLE]
We do not use Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC or MNP, LLP for financial information system design and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a system that aggregates source data underlying the financial statements or generates information that is significant to our financial statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We do not engage Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC or MNP, LLP to provide compliance outsourcing services.
Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that require that before MNP, LLP is engaged by us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement be:
Our entire board of directors pre-approves all services provided by our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and approved by our directors either before or after the respective services were rendered.
Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC and believe that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit was compatible with maintaining Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC's independence.
"HOUSEHOLDING" OF PROXY MATERIAL
The Securities and Exchange Commission permits companies and intermediaries (e.g. brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, commonly referred to as "householding", potentially means extra conveniences for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
A number of brokers with accountholders who are stockholders of our Company will be "householding" our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice previously provided by these brokers to stockholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker.
Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker.
OTHER BUSINESS
The Board knows of no other business that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the Meeting; however, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
If there are insufficient votes to approve any of the proposals contained herein, the Board may adjourn the Meeting to a later date and solicit additional proxies. If a vote is required to approve such adjournment, the proxies will be voted in favor of such adjournment.

To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward looking statements which, by definition involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the Sections; Description of Business, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward looking statements. Where in any forward looking statements, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. 
The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal proceedings.

We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 
Our financial statements are stated in U.S. Dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in US dollars and all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.

Our Current Business
Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of therapeutic pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals using innovative drug delivery platform technologies.
Our company focuses on pharmaceutical development of proprietary drug delivery technologies for multiple indications using small molecules, biological and botanical (e.g. cannabinoids) products to treat unmet medical needs. During our year ended January 31, 2018, we in-licensed a patented topical transdermal drug delivery technology platform, BiPhasix, and an oral drug delivery technology, Solmic Micelle, for delivery of cannabinoids. Subsequent to January 31, 2018, we have also acquired the Thrudermic Transdermal Nanotechnology (transdermal) and the Ready-To-Infuse Cannabis technology.
Our fully-owned subsidiaries, Pivot Green Stream Health Solutions Inc. ("PGS") and Pivot Naturals, LLC ("Pivot Naturals") (formerly, ERS), acquired subsequent to January 31, 2018, focus on the research, development, and commercialization of cannabinoid based nutraceuticals. PGS will generate data to support the safety and efficacy of cannabinoids as Natural Health Product ("NHPs") as outlined in Health Canada Regulations in order to make particular health claims. Health Canada publishes the Natural Health Products Regulations ("NHPR") which set out the requirements governing the sale, manufacture, packaging, labelling, importation, distribution and storage of NHPs. 
According to Health Canada, the objective of the NHPR is to provide reasonable assurance that products offered for sale in Canada are safe, efficacious and of high quality. PGS may also follow applicable and harmonized regulations for product development and commercialization in the US, European Union and Asia Pacific regions. Alternatively, PGS will commercialize certain cannabinoid products with a Licensed Producer and/or Licensed Distributor as per the regulations concerning Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations ("ACMPR") since certain active ingredients in cannabinoids remain restricted until new legislation permits ease of development and distribution in 2018. 
Lastly, PGS may also develop products containing cannabinoid active ingredients obtained from industrial hemp according to the Industrial Hemp Regulations ("IHR") permitting such products provided they are sourced from industrial hemp. Otherwise stated, this means that the plants and plant parts of the genera Cannabis, the leaves and flowering heads of which do not contain more than 0.3% THC w/w, and includes the derivatives of such plants and plant parts. 
PGS's pipeline targets indications such as cancer supportive care, pain and inflammation, women's sexual dysfunction, dermatology and eye disease. 
Our overall strategy includes the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1. Acquire market-ready natural health products from third-parties for rebranding and re-sale; 
   2. Acquire cannabinoid-based food additives for medical consumer sales; 
   3. Develop cannabinoid-based natural health products using our BiPhasix topical platform technology; 
   4. Develop pharmaceutical products delivered using our BiPhasix topical platform technology; 
   5. Obtain partnerships with Health Canada approved Authorized Licensed Producers and/or Licensed Distributors, which can provide restricted and non-restricted cannabinoids as per the ACMPR or the IHR; 
   6. Acquire novel proprietary drug delivery technologies, for example, metered dose, intra-nasal, suppositories; 
   7. Make an application at the appropriate time to acquire Health Canada's Authorized Licensed Producers and Licensed Dealers licenses as per the ACMPR; 
   8. Out-license our platform technologies to Licensed Producers or Licensed Distributors and other drug developers; 
   9. Secure and develop further intellectual property; 
   10. Opportunistically acquire later stage drug candidates that provide new treatment options to address unmet medical needs in health care; and 
   11. Establish partnerships with large and specialty pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies to collaboratively develop and/or commercialize our products. 
[END TABLE]
Our Research and Development Strategies
Our management team has implemented a business minded and cost conscious approach to product research and development by focusing on development of novel therapies to address unmet needs in health care. Our research and development strategy will apply novel drug delivery options for new and/or existing drugs or NHPs. 
For a drug to be successful it must be both efficacious and acceptably safe. Before a drug may be commercially marketed, it must be scrutinized and approved by applicable health authorities (such as Health Canada and the FDA in the United States) in each country or jurisdiction where it is sought to be sold. In pharmaceutical research and development, clinical trials are conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug and the data to be collected for such new drugs. Health authorities then scrutinize the pre-clinical and clinical data and determine, based on the results, whether a drug may be sold to the public. Similarly, clinical trials can only take place once satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the product and its non-clinical safety, and approval to conduct clinical trials has been granted by the appropriate health authority in the country where the trial is scheduled to take place.
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV trials are 'post approval' studies. Due to the considerable cost that may be required to complete a full series of clinical trials, the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor, who may be the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company that developed the drug that is the subject of the study. Since the diversity of roles may exceed the resources of the sponsor, clinical trials are often managed by outsourced partners such as contract research organizations. Furthermore, approval rates for new drugs at each clinical trial stage are prohibitively low, which may require the sponsor to finance additional trials or abandon the drug under development altogether.
We will also develop products regulated under Canada's Natural Health Products Guidance and support claims with clinical based data as per current regulations. 
Pre-clinical safety studies for pharmaceutical or NHP product development are ongoing to advance at least two of our product candidates.
Our Platform Technologies
BiPhasix Transdermal Drug Delivery Technology (Topical Platform)
Pivot has acquired worldwide rights from Altum for its patented topical transdermal drug delivery technology platform, or BiPhasix, which we will use for the delivery and commercialization of cannabinoid, cannabidiol ("CBD") and tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") based products.
The BiPhasix technology has the potential to deliver drugs less invasively than by injections. It also has the potential to topically deliver therapeutic amounts of drugs with better absorption rates, where creams, ointments or conventional liposomes have not been effective.
Dermal Barrier and Challenges
The skin is often the subject of intensive dermatological therapy. However, except for certain low molecular weight compounds, it is seldom viewed as a route of delivery for systemically acting drugs. This is due partly to the fact that, by design, the skin is a formidable barrier to penetration by external agents and the traditional arsenal of creams, ointments and gels have not proven themselves to be effective in delivery. In order to reach their target site within the underlying layers of the skin or beyond the skin to the systemic circulation, topical drugs must first penetrate the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin. It is this layer which is considered to be the rate-limiting barrier to drug absorption.
For dermatological applications where the goal is to treat the skin, the residence time of drugs in the target tissue should be of sufficiently long duration since rapid systemic absorption may limit the therapeutic response and contribute to systemic side effects. This latter case may be the fate of many small molecules formulated in conventional vehicles. In some cases, it is desirable and possible to achieve systemic delivery of small molecules via the transdermal route (for example, nicotine). However, larger molecules, whether intended for dermatological or systemic delivery, would normally not gain entry beyond the stratum corneum. The goal is to have a safe delivery system that does not irritate or damage the skin barrier after repeated usage in patients.
Pivot will use BiPhasix as the next generation of patented liposomal delivery system where a number of features of liposomes are greatly improved. In contrast to traditional liposomes that entrap a single, aqueous phase, our system is a complex system where the lipid bilayers entrap both aqueous and oil phases in the form of a stabilized emulsion.
BiPhasix is constructed with multi-compartmental lipid vesicles, each comprising of aqueous compartments and bi-layer compartments in addition to the following unique features of this patented delivery system: Micellar compartments and oily compartments.
These additional features make it possible to achieve greater formulation versatility than previously attainable with traditional creams, gels, ointments or conventional liposomal delivery systems. Thus, the BiPhasix delivery system combines the advantages of liposomes and micro-emulsions, offering a wider range of formulation options for a variety of drug substances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Water soluble compounds; 
· Lipid soluble compounds; 
· Proteins; 
· Peptides; and 
· Plasmids. 
[END TABLE]
Technical Facts of BiPhasix
BiPhasix is a dermal delivery system for macro-molecules and has the following characteristics:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Flexible and able to deliver both lipophilic and hydrophilic molecules; 
· Vesicles are composed of phospholipid bilayers (formed from pro-liposomal gel) which entraps an oil-in-water submicron emulsion; and 
· Hydrophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients are incorporated into the aqueous phase of the oil-in-water emulsion, whereas lipophilic active pharmaceutical ingredients can be incorporated into the oil phase of the submicron emulsion. 
[END TABLE]
Structure, assembly and properties of BiPhasix carrying an active pharmaceutical ingredient include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1. Vesicles consist of concentric phospholipid bilayers; 
   2. Cationic submicron emulsion droplets; 
   3. Cationic surfactant micelles; and 
   4. A water phase. 
[END TABLE]
Additional facts regarding the BiPhasix delivery system include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The amount of drug that can be incorporated include quantities at the microgram to milligram levels; 
· The size of molecules formulated are approximately 300 daltons ("Da") to 100 kilodaltons ("kDa"); 
· Loading capacity range from 30-70%; 
· Increased stability of proteins are provided; 
· No organic solvents are used in the process; 
· No specialized manufacturing equipment are required; 
· BiPhasix products are easily scalable using standard pharmaceutical industrial equipment; and 
· BiPhasix formulated product have been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") and the The German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). 
[END TABLE]
Delivery Mechanisms
The delivery of the BiPhasix vesicles is achieved by the uptake of the vesicles and encapsulated drug into the skin or mucosa via the lipid rich channels, followed by release of drug from the vesicles in a formulation-controlled manner. The result may be either a rapid cutaneous transit time to produce primarily transdermal delivery of the drug, or depot formation within the skin with slow release for primarily dermal delivery of the drug. The following is a hypothetical diagram showing penetration of the biphasic vesicles into the skin for drug delivery:

Key Advantages of BiPhasix
The key advantages of BiPhasix are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Alternative routes: BiPhasix can serve as an alternative dosage form to injectables by providing less invasive routes of administration, such as dermal, transdermal, nasal, vaginal and rectal. 
· Controlled release: BiPhasix can be formulated to effect varying degrees of tissue penetration and rate of release at the target site, in accordance with a desired clinical goals. 
· Bioavailability studies: As shown in the tables below, BiPhasix can significantly enhance the bioavailability of many drugs, leading to improved clinical outcomes. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Stability: As shown in the above tables, BiPhasix has demonstrated excellent stability with most therapeutic agents tested, especially proteins, which are characteristically unstable in traditional vehicles. Vulnerable drugs can be shielded from degradation in BiPhasix, thereby enhancing their clinical usefulness and commercial viability. BiPhasix is compatible with most plastics and other container-closure systems. 
· Solvent-free and no animal product: BiPhasix is formulated with biocompatible materials. Neither organic solvents nor ingredients of animal origin are used in its manufacture. 
· Manufacturing feasibility: Clinical supplies and commercial batches can be prepared using conventional manufacturing equipment and container closure systems. Specialized equipment and extensive capital investment are not required. 
· Patented technology: The BiPhasix patent pending technology provides market exclusivity for new NHP or prescription drug products containing Cannabinoids, CBD and THC. 
· Clinical experience: As shown in the above tables, the BiPhasix delivery system has been tested in FDA and EMA approved trial settings delivering large molecule interferon alpha 2b to women to treat HPV induced cervical neoplasia.

Thrudermic Transdermal Nanotechnology (Topical Platform)
Pivot has acquired, in March 2018, the worldwide rights to Thrudermic's patented Transdermal Nanotechnology for the development and commercialization of transdermal cannabinoids. Developed in Israel, the Thrudermic lipid-based nano dispersion technology for topical cannabinoids uses FDA approved materials. The technology has the ability to specifically formulate individual drugs to control and prolong drug release while maintaining steady therapeutic concentrations, The technology can handle water soluble and water insoluble drugs with no change to the skin morphology, no sensitivity to the digestive system, no pain from injections and no observed adverse reactions.
Solmic Solubilization Drug Delivery Technology (Oral Platform)
Pivot has acquired the worldwide rights to Solmic's Solubilisation Technology for the development and commercialization of cannabinoid-containing natural extracts. Solmic's technology allows active ingredients to become water soluble without changing their composition and nature. Solubilized substances that are packed in micelles are protected from degradation from light, stomach acid, and from enzymes released in the intestinal tract. The micellisation process results in a stable, homogenous and transparent mixture, which significantly increases uptake of fat soluble ingredients from the gut into the blood system of fat soluble ingredients, resulting in greater bioavailability.
Ready-To-Infuse Cannabis Technology
Pivot's patented Ready-To-Infuse-Cannabis ("RTIC") process technology, acquired in February 2018, creates precise and repeatable dosing of cannabis by transforming concentrated cannabis oil into a stable, emulsifiable, odorless and flavorless powder form. The derived powder may then be encapsulated and infused for use in beverages, edibles, lotions and additional health and personal care products. The RTIC process is conducive for manufacturing of a wide array of products, including:
1. Capsules/Tablets: One of our patents is issued for use in capsules and tablets. Another of our patents has numerous claims for adding other active ingredients to tablets and capsules, such as Melatonin or Gingko Biloba, allowing for specific treatment for targeted effects. Efficient mass production of capsules, conforming to GMP standards is part of our core competencies and manufacturing capabilities. Production of capsules is scheduled for the third quarter of the calendar year 2018.
2. Beverage/Additive Stick Packs: Single-serve stick packs are convenient and functional when used in hot beverages. Stick packs are also highly functional. Production of stick packs is scheduled for the third quarter of the calendar year 2018.
3. Pet Products: Our patented cannabis powder will also be mass produced and packaged in bulk for both consumer pet health needs. Production of pet powders is scheduled for the third quarter of calendar year 2018. 
4. Lotions and Topical Creams: Our patented lotion and topical technology will be mass produced and packaged for consumer health needs. Production of lotions and topical creams is scheduled for the first quarter of calendar 2019.

[END TABLE]
The following section describes the most common phases of clinical drug trials with reference to the clinical trial requirements that we anticipate will be required for each of our pharmaceutical products in the future and funding permitting.
Pre-Clinical Trials
Pre-clinical trials involve in vitro (test tube) and in vivo (animal) experiments using wide ranging doses of the study drug to obtain preliminary efficacy, toxicity and pharmacokinetic information. Such tests assist pharmaceutical companies in deciding whether a drug candidate possesses scientific merit for further development as an investigational new drug. In addition, formulation and dosage regimen work studies will need to be conducted.
Phase 0
Phase 0 is a recent designation for exploratory, first in human trials conducted in accordance with the FDA's 2006 Guidance on Exploratory Investigational New Drug. These trials are generally used for novel anticancer drugs.
Distinctive features of Phase 0 trials include the administration of single subtherapeutic doses (doses not intended to treat diseases) of the study drug to a small number of subjects (10-15) to gather preliminary data on the agent's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
Phase I
Phase I trials are the first stage of drug testing in human subjects. Normally, a small group of healthy volunteers (20-50) will be selected. This phase includes trials designed to assess the safety, tolerability and effects of the drug in relation to the human body, including how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated by the body. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed.
Phase I trials also normally include dose-ranging (or dose escalation) studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses will usually be a fraction of any dose that causes harm in animal testing.
Phase I trials most often include healthy volunteers; however, real patients are used in some circumstances, such as when patients have an end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. This exception to the rule most often occurs in oncology (cancer) and HIV drug trials. Volunteers are paid an inconvenience fee for the time they spend in the volunteer center. Pay ranges from a small amount of money for a short period of residence to a larger amount of up to approximately $6,000 depending on the length of the volunteer's participation in the trial.
Phase II
Once the initial safety of a study drug has been confirmed in Phase I trials, Phase II trials are performed on larger groups (20-300) and are designed to assess how well the drug works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments using a larger group of volunteers and patients. When the development process for a new drug fails, this usually occurs during Phase II trials when the drug is discovered not to work as planned or to have toxic effects.
Phase II studies are sometimes divided into Phase IIA and Phase IIB. Phase IIA is specifically designed to assess dosing requirements (how much of the drug should be given), while Phase IIB is specifically designed to study efficacy (how well the drug works at the prescribed dose(s)).
Some trials combine Phase I and Phase II, and test both efficacy and toxicity.
All of our planned anticancer products will need to undergo Phase II clinical trials. Completion of these trials is subject to our ability to obtain adequate financing.
We will not establish a firm start date until we raise sufficient financing, which there is no guarantee that we will be able to do. The trial protocol for our Phase II trial has been developed with input from our clinical advisors.
Phase III
Phase III studies are randomized controlled multi-center trials on large patient groups (300-3,000 or more, depending upon the disease or medical condition studied), and are intended to definitively assess the effectiveness of the drug as compared to the current "gold standard" treatment. Because of their size and comparatively long duration, Phase III trials are the most expensive, time-consuming and difficult trials to design and run, especially in therapies for chronic medical conditions.
It is common practice that certain Phase III trials may continue while a regulatory submission is pending at the appropriate regulatory agency. This allows patients to continue to receive possibly lifesaving drugs until the drug can be obtained commercially. Other reasons for performing additional trials at this stage may include "label expansion" (to show the drug is suitable for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing), obtaining additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the drug. Studies in this phase are categorized by some companies as "Phase IIIB studies".
While not required in all cases, it is typically expected that at least two successful Phase III trials will be necessary to demonstrate a drug's safety and efficacy to obtain approval from appropriate regulatory agencies, such as the FDA in the United States, the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia or the European Medicines Agency in the European Union, for example.
Once a drug has proved satisfactory after Phase III trials, the trial results are usually combined into a large document containing a comprehensive description of the methods and results of human and animal studies, manufacturing procedures, formulation details and shelf life. This collection of information makes up the regulatory submission that is provided for review to the appropriate regulatory authorities in different countries. They review each submission, and, it is hoped, give sponsors approval to market the drug.
Most drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials can be marketed under FDA norms with proper recommendations and guidelines, but the drugs must be recalled immediately from the market if any adverse effects are reported. While most pharmaceutical companies refrain from this practice, it is not abnormal to see many drugs undergoing Phase III clinical trials in the market.
We anticipate that all of our current planned products will require us to undertake the conduct of Phase III clinical trials; however, we lack sufficient information to estimate the costs or timeframe required to complete any Phase III clinical trials at this time. Our ability to pursue Phase III trials will be subject to our ability to obtain adequate financing and successfully complete earlier trials phases for the products in question.
Phase IV
A Phase IV trial is also known as a post-marketing surveillance trial. Phase IV trials involve safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold. Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken by a sponsoring company for competitive or other reasons (for example, the drug may not have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials). The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I through III clinical trials. Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug no longer being sold or being restricted to certain uses.
We are unable to accurately anticipate at this time whether our current planned products will require us to undertake Phase IV clinical trials. Similarly, we are unable to accurately anticipate at this time what the costs or timeframe to complete those trials might be. Our ability to pursue any Phase IV trials which may be required of us or which we may undertake voluntarily will be subject to our ability to adequately finance those trials and to successfully complete Phase III trials.
Other
Manufacturing
We have limited experience in, and do not own facilities for, manufacturing any products or product candidates. Although we intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce our products for both clinical and commercial supplies, we will oversee the production of those products and do not anticipate relying on any particular contract manufacturer exclusively.
If we obtain FDA approval in the United States or marketing application approval outside the United States for any of our product candidates, we plan to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities for large-scale commercialization. These contract manufacturers will be subject to extensive government regulations. Regulatory authorities in the markets that we intend to serve require that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("GMP") as set by the FDA. In this regard, we plan to engage only contract manufacturers who have the capability to manufacture drug products in compliance with current GMP in bulk quantities for commercialization. We also intend to safeguard our intellectual property when working with contract manufacturers by working only with manufacturers who in our estimation have a strong track record of safeguarding confidential information and who are willing to enter into agreements with us that impose upon them strict intellectual property protection measures.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We currently have no sales or distribution capabilities and limited marketing capabilities. In order to commercialize our products, we must develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or make arrangements with other parties to perform these services for us.
Competition
If any of our products receive marketing approval, they may compete against, and may be used in combination with, well-established products that are currently used for the treatment of their respective indications. By the time we are able to commercialize a product candidate, the competition and potential competition may be greater and more direct. Several companies are focusing on new compounds, most of which are in pre-clinical or early phases of development.
We expect to compete with others on, among other things, the safety and efficacy of our products. Competing successfully will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel; to identify, secure the rights to and develop pharmaceutical products and compounds; and to exploit these products and compounds commercially before others are able to develop competing products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because insurers and other third-party payors in some cases seek to encourage the use of generic products making branded products less attractive to buyers from a cost perspective.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our products and product candidates by obtaining and maintaining a strong proprietary position both in the United States and in other countries. To develop and maintain our proprietary position, we will rely on patent protection, regulatory protection, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities.
It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. These agreements provide that all inventions related to our business that are conceived by the individual during our relationship shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Government Regulations
Our current and future operations and research and development activities are or will be subject to various laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct or plan to conduct our business, including but not limited to the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and potentially certain member countries from the European Union. These laws and regulations govern the research, development, sale and marketing of pharmaceuticals, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, chemical products and materials, waste management and other matters relating to the pharmaceutical industry. We may require permits, registrations or other authorizations to maintain our operations and to carry out our future research and development activities, and these permits, registrations or authorizations will be subject to revocation, modification and renewal.
Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with lease conditions, regulatory requirements and the provisions of required permits, registrations or other authorizations, and violators may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines, injunctions, or both. The failure to obtain or maintain a required permit may also result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, and third parties may have the right to sue to enforce compliance.
We expect to be able to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and do not believe that such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. We have obtained and intend to obtain all permits, licenses and approvals required by all applicable regulatory agencies to maintain our current operations and to carry out our future research and development activities. We are not aware of any material violations of permits, licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations, and we believe that we will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals. All our pharmaceutical product candidates will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Our drug candidates are subject to rigorous pre-clinical testing and subsequent clinical trials and other premarketing approval requirements of the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern or affect the manufacturing, safety, labeling, stability, record-keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. When we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, the approval may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed, promoted and advertised. Further, approved pharmaceuticals and manufacturers are subject to ongoing review and previously unknown problems may be discovered that may result in restrictions on the manufacture, sale or use of approved pharmaceuticals or their withdrawal from the market.
Pre-Clinical Studies
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the United States, stringent governmental requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. Pre-clinical testing results obtained from these studies, including tests in several animal species, are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for initial trials in human volunteers.
Clinical Trials
If a company wants to conduct clinical trials in the United States to test a new drug in humans, an Investigational New Drug ("IND") Application must be prepared and submitted to the FDA. The IND Application becomes effective, if not rejected or put on clinical hold by the FDA, within 30 days of filing the application. In addition, an Institutional Review Board must review and approve the trial protocol and monitor the trial on an ongoing basis. The FDA may, at any time during the 30 day review period or at any time thereafter, impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials may commence or recommence without FDA authorization, and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. The IND Application process can result in substantial delay and expense.
New Drug Application
After completion of clinical trials, if there is substantial evidence that the drug is both safe and effective, a New Drug Application is prepared and submitted to the FDA for review. The New Drug Application must contain all of the essential information on the drug gathered to that date, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the content and format of a New Drug Application must conform with all FDA regulations and guidelines. Accordingly, the preparation and submission of a New Drug Application is an expensive and major undertaking for a sponsor.
The FDA reviews all New Drug Applications submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information from the sponsor rather than accepting a New Drug Application for filing. In such an event, the New Drug Application must be submitted with the additional information and, again, is subject to review before filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in depth review of the New Drug Application. By law, the FDA has 180 days in which to conduct the initial review the New Drug Application and respond to the applicant. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA through requests for additional information and clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and the scope of any approval. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation, but gives great weight to it. If the FDA evaluations of both the New Drug Application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied in order to secure final approval. If the FDA's evaluation of the New Drug Application submission or manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the New Drug Application or issue a not approvable letter.
Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
The FDA's fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for their condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug for a specific indication as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA must determine if the product qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request.
For a product candidate where fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a New Drug Application before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and pays applicable user fees. However, the time period specified in the Prescription Drug User Fees Act, which governs the time period goals the FDA has committed to reviewing a New Drug Application, does not begin until the complete application is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
In some cases, the FDA may designate a product for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review, or review within a targeted six-month time frame from the time of acceptance of filing a New Drug Application, if the product provides a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated product generally meets the FDA's criteria for priority review. We cannot guarantee that any of our products will receive a priority review designation, or if a priority designation is received, that review or approval will be faster than conventional FDA procedures.
When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designations for our products. We cannot predict the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track process on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval on any of our potential products. Importantly, fast track designation does not result in the elimination or waiver of any pre-clinical or clinical trial requirements.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a New Drug Application. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a longer market [orphan] exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for up to seven years after receiving FDA approval.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of a New Drug Application under Section 505(b) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for a new chemical entity. A drug qualifies as a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active ingredient. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides data exclusivity by prohibiting abbreviated New Drug Applications, and the submission of section 505(b)(2) applications, which are marketing applications where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval, by another company for another version of such drug during the exclusive period. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of a full New Drug Application for the same active ingredient, although the applicant would be required to conduct its own adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any products we manufacture or distribute under FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and, where appropriate, state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and each third-party manufacturer we utilize.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers from communicating on the subject of off-label use.
The FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our programs or our future product candidates, or such approval of new indications for our future products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad in the European Union.
Clinical Trials
Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. The regulatory controls on clinical research in the European Union are now largely harmonized following the implementation of the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or CTD. Compliance with the national implementations of the CTD has been mandatory since May 1, 2004. However, variations in member state regimes continue to exist, particularly in the small number of member states that have yet to implement the CTD fully.
All member states currently require regulatory and independent ethics committee approval of interventional clinical trials. European regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of adverse event reports during a study and a copy of the final study report.
Marketing Authorization
In the European Union, approval of new medicinal products can be obtained through the mutual recognition procedure or the centralized procedure. The mutual recognition procedure entails initial assessment by the national authorities of a single member state and subsequent review by national authorities in other member states based on the initial assessment. The centralized procedure requires the submission of a single Marketing Authorization Application (a "MAA") to the EMA leading to an approval that is valid in all European Union member states. It is required for certain medicinal products, such as biotechnology products and certain new chemical entities, and is optional, or available at the EMA's discretion, for other new chemical entities or innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.
Under the centralized procedure, a MAA is submitted to the EMA. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each MAA. These countries each prepare an assessment report, which are then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state.
Advertising
In the European Union, the promotion of prescription medicines is subject to intense regulation and control, including a prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising. Some jurisdictions require that all promotional materials for prescription medicines be subjected to either prior internal or regulatory review or approval.
Data Exclusivity
For an MAA filed after October 30, 2005, European Union regulators offer eight years of data exclusivity during which generic drug manufacturers cannot file abridged applications. This is followed by two years of market exclusivity during which generic MAAs may be reviewed and approved but during which generic drug manufacturers cannot launch products. The manner in which these new exclusivity provisions will be applied in practice remains far from clear and there can be no assurance that our programs or our other current or future product candidates will qualify for such exclusivity.
Other Regulatory Requirements
If a marketing authorization is granted for our products in the European Union, the holder of the marketing authorization will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations. A holder of a marketing authorization for our products is legally obliged to fulfill a number of obligations by virtue of its status as a Marketing Authorization Holder (a "MAH"). While the associated legal responsibility and liability cannot be delegated, the MAH can delegate the performance of related tasks to third parties, provided that this delegation is appropriately documented. A MAH can therefore either ensure that it has adequate resources, policies and procedures to fulfill its responsibilities, or can delegate the performance of some or all of its obligations to others, such as distributors or marketing partners.
The obligations of a MAH include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Manufacturing and Batch Release: MAHs should guarantee that all manufacturing operations comply with relevant laws and regulations, applicable good manufacturing practices, the product specifications and manufacturing conditions set out in the marketing authorization and that each batch of product is subject to appropriate release formalities. 
· Pharmacovigilance: MAHs are obliged to monitor the safety of products post-approval and to submit to the regulators safety reports on an expedited and periodic basis. There is an obligation to notify regulators of any other information that may affect the risk benefit ratio for the product. 
· Advertising and Promotion: MAHs remain responsible for all advertising and promotion of their products in the relevant jurisdiction, including promotional activities by other companies or individuals on their behalf. Some jurisdictions require that a MAH subject all promotional materials to either prior internal or regulatory review and approval. 
· Medical Affairs/Scientific Service: MAHs are required to have a function responsible for disseminating scientific and medical information on their medicinal products, predominantly to healthcare professionals, but also to regulators and patients. 
· Legal Representation and Distributor Issues: MAHs are responsible for regulatory actions or inactions of their distributors and agents, including the failure of distributors to provide a MAH with safety data within a timeframe that allows the MAH to fulfill its reporting obligations. 
· Preparation, Filing and Maintenance of the Application and Subsequent Marketing Authorization: MAHs have general obligations to maintain appropriate records, to comply with the marketing authorization's terms and conditions, to submit renewal applications and to pay all appropriate fees to the authorities. There are also general reporting obligations, such as an obligation to inform regulators of any information that may lead to the modification of the marketing authorization dossier or product labeling, and of any action to suspend, revoke or withdraw an approval or to prohibit or suspend the marketing of a product. 
[END TABLE]
We may hold marketing authorizations for our products in our own name, or appoint an affiliate or a collaboration partner to hold the marketing authorization on our behalf. Any failure by a MAH to comply with these obligations may result in regulatory action against the MAH and its approvals and ultimately threaten our ability to commercialize our products.
Approvals Outside of the United States and the European Union
We will also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our products. Whether or not FDA approval or European marketing authorization has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of other foreign countries must still be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval or a European marketing authorization. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that approval in one country will result in approval in any other country.
Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
General:
In the United States and elsewhere, patients' access to pharmaceutical products depends in significant part on the coverage and reimbursement of a product or service by third-party payors, such as government programs, private insurance plans and employers. Third-party payors increasingly are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private payors. We may be unable to achieve reimbursement from some payors because they may not consider our products to be "reasonable and necessary" or cost-effective. Furthermore, it is possible that even if payors are willing to reimburse patients for our products, the reimbursement levels may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
In many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to direct governmental control and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and the control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state: some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed, and other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement means by which the government can negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. While we cannot predict whether such legislative bills will become law, their enactment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Medicare:
In the following section, all references to "CMS" refer to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
We expect that in the United States, some or possibly a majority of the patients who are treated with our products will be Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS is the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that administers both Medicare and Medicaid. Two aspects of Medicare reimbursement will be relevant to our products: the availability of reimbursement for physician services for administration of our products and the availability of reimbursement for our products themselves.
The CMS has asserted the authority of Medicare not to cover particular products or services if it determines that they are not "reasonable and necessary" for Medicare beneficiaries. The CMS may create a national coverage determination (a "NCD") for a product, which establishes on a nationwide basis the indications that will be covered and the frequency limits for administration of the product. However, for most new drugs that are eligible for payment, the CMS does not create a NCD. We do not know whether we will seek or obtain a NCD for any of our current or potential products or whether any NCD we obtain will contain favorable coverage terms. As mentioned above, if Medicare coverage for our products is available, the CMS may decide to provide reimbursement through one of two avenues: Part B coverage for physician-administered drugs, or Part D coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Under Part B coverage, Medicare reimburses purchasers of drugs that meet three statutory requirements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the product is reasonable and necessary; 
· the product is not usually self-administered and as such is incidental to a physician's service in the office setting; and 
· the administering physician bills Medicare directly for the product. 
[END TABLE]
If there is not a national coverage decision, the local Medicare contractors that are responsible for administering the Part B program on a regional basis may have the discretion to decline coverage and reimbursement for a drug or to issue a local coverage decision (an "LCD"). These policies can include both coverage criteria for the drug and frequency limits for the administration of the drug. The local contractors in different areas of the country may determine that our products should be treated like most topical patches and may deny coverage under Part B or, even if they allow coverage, may establish varying coverage criteria and frequency limits for any product. Furthermore, obtaining LCDs in the various regions can be a time-consuming and expensive process.
Medicare payment for physician services related to the administration of any of our products, if any, will most likely be determined according to a prospectively set payment rate, determined by a procedure code established by the American Medical Association. These codes, called Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") codes, describe the procedure performed and can be specific or more general in nature. We believe that although there are existing CPT codes that could be used, although a specific code for the administration of each of our products would be preferable. If applicable, we plan to apply for a specific CPT code. If, at launch, a specific CPT code is not available, local Medicare contractors will advise which existing CPT code should be used for services related to the administration of our products.
The CMS has been considering changes to Medicare reimbursement that could result in lower payments for physician-administered drugs, and Congress may also consider legislation that would mandate lower reimbursement levels. A reduction in reimbursement levels could materially and adversely affect our revenue.
The CMS may determine that some of our products do not qualify for Part B coverage and should instead be covered under the Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit. Because, unlike Part B, Part D coverage reimburses patients only for the drug itself and does not provide reimbursement for the physician's administration services (though a physician can bill for service under Part B and it is possible that the CMS will provide such coverage for the administration of any of our products, even if the product in question is covered under Part D), physicians may not consider our products as attractive a treatment option if they are reimbursed under Part D instead of Part B. In addition, under Part D, there are multiple types of plans and numerous plan sponsors, each with its own formulary and product access requirements. While the CMS evaluates Part D plans' proposed formularies for potentially discriminatory practices, the plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies, establishing tiered co-pay structures and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the use of specific products. Moreover, Part D plan sponsors are permitted and encouraged to negotiate rebates with manufacturers. Revenue for our products will be substantially affected by their respective formulary status on Part D plans and the rebates that Part D plan sponsors are able to negotiate.
Medicaid:
Most State Medicaid programs have established preferred drug lists, and the process, criteria and timeframe for obtaining placement on the preferred drug list vary from state to state. A federal law establishes minimum rebates that a manufacturer must pay for Medicaid utilization of a product, and many states have established supplemental rebate programs as a condition for including a drug product on a preferred drug list. Submitting a preferred drug list application to each state will be a time-consuming and expensive process, and it is not clear how many or which state programs will accept the applications. Review times for these applications can vary from weeks to 14 months or more.
Private Insurance Reimbursement:
Commercial insurers usually offer two types of benefits: medical benefits and pharmacy benefits. In most private insurance plans, physician-administered drugs are provided under the medical benefit. If private insurers decide to cover any of our products, they will reimburse for the drug(s) and its administration in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan's revenue targets, employer and benefit manager input and the contract negotiated with their physicians. Like Medicare and Medicaid, commercial insurers have the authority to place coverage and utilization limits on physician-administered drugs. Many private insurers tend to adopt reimbursement methodologies for a product similar to those adopted by Medicare. Revenue for our products may be materially and adversely affected if private payors make unfavorable reimbursement decisions or delay making favorable reimbursement decisions.
Subsidiaries

The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and formation statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, at http://www.sec.gov.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
There is substantial doubt as to whether we will continue operations. If we discontinue operations, you could lose your investment.
Our financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. However, as at January 31, 2018, we have not earned any revenues and had an accumulated deficit of $20,718,935. We anticipate that we will incur increased expenses without realizing sufficient revenues (if any) to offset those expenses and we therefore expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue our operations is dependent on obtaining additional financing and generating future revenues, and no assurance can be given that we will successfully be able to do so. Accordingly, our financial statements contain disclosure of management's determination that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Importantly, the inclusion in our financial statements of a going concern opinion may negatively impact our ability to raise future financing and achieve future revenue. The threat of our ability to continue as a going concern will be removed only when, in the opinion of our auditor, our revenues have reached a level that is able to sustain our business operations.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing from outside sources and eventually generate enough revenues, we may be forced to sell a portion or all of our assets, or curtail or discontinue our operations. If any of these happens, you could lose all or part of your investment. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to our recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary if we become unable to continue as a going concern.
We have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future. We also have negative capital cash flows from operating activities. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or with positive cash flow from operating activities, we may suspend or cease our operations.
We have not generated any revenue since our inception on June 10, 2002 and we have incurred operating and net losses in each year of our existence. We experienced a net loss of $121,182 for the year ended January 31, 2018, compared to a net loss of $6,278,207 for the year ended January 31, 2017. We expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future as we develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates and pursue our other research and development activities. If our products are not successful in research and development or in clinical trials, does not gain regulatory approval or does not achieve market acceptance, we may never generate any revenue. We also cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize our products. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitability, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, you could lose all or part of your investment.
We will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities and proposed acquisition, and if such funds are not available we may need to significantly curtail or cease our operations.
We will require substantial funds to research, develop, test and protect our product candidates, and to manufacture and market any such candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. Based on our planned research and development and commercialization activities, we anticipate that we will require funds of approximately $24.45 million to proceed with completing the development and commercialization of our products. If we do not raise sufficient funds, our plan of operation will be delayed until such time as we raise sufficient funds, provided we are able to do so. Further, the cost of carrying out our operating activities and research and development activities is not fixed, and our cash levels may at any time prove to be insufficient to finance them. Our financing needs may change substantially because a number of factors which are difficult to predict or which may be outside of our control. These include increased competition, the costs of licensing existing drugs and protecting rights to our proprietary technology, the resources required to complete pre-clinical and clinical studies, and the length and results of the regulatory approval process.
We may not succeed in raising the additional funds that we require because such funds may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. We intend to seek additional funding through strategic alliances or through public or private sales of our equity securities, and we may also obtain equipment leases and pursue opportunities to obtain debt financing in the future. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funding on a timely basis, we may be forced to significantly curtail or cease our operations.
Our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
If our R&D projects are not completed in a timely fashion, our Company could experience:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· substantial additional cost for the conduct of IND supporting R&D activities; 
· additional competition in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical indications in our pipeline; 
· additional delay in obtaining requisite regulatory approvals; and 
· delay in obtaining future inflow of cash from financial or partnership activities, any of which could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
[END TABLE]
Any products that we may develop will be required to undergo a time-consuming, costly and burdensome pre-market approval process, and if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our products we may never become profitable.
Any products that we may develop will be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development activities, conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. In the United States, for example, the prospective therapeutic products that we intend to develop and market are regulated by the FDA under its new drug development and review process. Before such therapeutic products can be marketed, we must obtain clearance from the FDA by submitting an investigational new drug application, then by successfully completing human testing under three phases of clinical trials, and finally by submitting a new drug application.
The time required to obtain approvals for our prospective therapeutic products from the FDA and other agencies in foreign locales with similar processes is unpredictable. We expect to be able to accelerate the approval process and to increase the chances of approval by using existing and approved drugs as the basis for our own technology. However, we cannot guarantee that our expectations will be realized, and there is no assurance that we will ever receive regulatory approval to use our proprietary substances, methods and processes. If we do not obtain such regulatory approval, we may never become profitable.
We may not commence clinical testing for any of our prospective therapeutic products and the commercial value of any clinical study that we may conduct will depend significantly upon our choice of indication and our patient population selection. If we are unable to commence clinical testing or if we make a poor choice in terms of clinical strategy, we may never achieve revenues.
In order to commence clinical testing, we must successfully complete and obtain positive scientific results from pre-clinical studies and, in the case of an existing drug that we are re-profiling for a new indication, adopt existing pre-clinical or early stage clinical studies to our own research. If we successfully complete any clinical study of our own, the commercial value of any such study will significantly depend upon our choice of indication and our patient population selection for that indication.
Our clinical trials for each drug may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of that candidate, which could force us to abandon our product development plans for that drug candidate.
Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive pre-clinical testing and clinical trials that each product is both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Clinical trial results are inherently difficult to predict, and the results we have obtained or may obtain from third-party trials or from our own trials may not be indicative of results from future trials. We may also suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after obtaining promising results in earlier studies.
Although we intend to modify any of our protocols in ongoing studies to address any setbacks, there can be no assurance that these modifications will be adequate or that these or other factors will not have a negative effect on the results of our clinical trials. This could significantly disrupt our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize our product candidates. Furthermore, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable safety risk to patients, either in the form of undesirable side effects or otherwise. If we cannot show that our product candidates are both safe and effective in clinical trials, we may be forced to abandon our business plan.
We will rely on third parties to conduct our formulation development, chemistry activities, as well as pre-clinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform as contractually required or otherwise expected we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, which may prevent us from becoming profitable.
If we are unable to establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these functions, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates.
In order to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we must either develop a satisfactory sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or enter into collaborations with partners to perform these services for us. We will require substantial resources to create such an infrastructure, and we may never possess the resources to do so. For example, we may be unable to recruit and retain an adequate number of effective sales and marketing personnel or we may incur unforeseen costs and expenses in connection with developing the necessary infrastructure.
Although we plan to develop our own sales and marketing organizations in some markets, we intend to enter into partnering, co-promotion and other distribution arrangements to commercialize our products in most markets. We may not be able to enter into collaborations on acceptable terms, if at all, and we may face competition in our search for partners with whom we may collaborate. If we are not able to build a satisfactory sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or collaborate with one or more partners to perform these functions, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which could cause us to cease our operations.
Our product candidates may never gain market acceptance even if we obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, which could prevent us from generating revenues.
Even if we receive the necessary regulatory approvals to commercially sell our product candidates, the success of these candidates will depend on their acceptance by physicians and patients, among other things. Market acceptance of, and demand for, any product that we develop and commercialize will depend on many factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy; 
· our ability to obtain sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement; 
· the availability, relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments; 
· the effectiveness of our or our collaborators' sales, marketing and distribution strategy; and 
· publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments.

If our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.
We will depend on other parties to manufacture our product candidates. If these parties fail to meet our manufacturing requirements and applicable regulatory requirements, our product development and commercialization efforts could suffer and we may never realize a profit.
If we obtain the necessary regulatory approvals to market our products, we will rely on contract manufacturers as single source suppliers for our product candidates.
Because of our planned reliance on contract manufacturers, we may also be exposed to additional risks, including those related to intellectual property and the failure of such manufacturers to comply with strictly-enforced regulatory requirements, manufacture components to our specifications, or deliver sufficient component quantities to us in a timely manner. For example, a contract manufacturer working on our behalf may violate the intellectual property rights of a third party in manufacturing a component of one of our products, and if such a violation occurs without our knowledge, we may be held vicariously liable for the acts of our contractor, incur related costs and court mandated damages, or become enjoined from selling products which violate those third-party intellectual property rights. Similarly, if a contract manufacturer working on our behalf is found to be in violation of FDA or other national regulatory standards regarding the manufacture, packaging or labeling of any of our products, we could face any number of adverse consequences including costly regulatory investigations and fines, interruptions in the flow of our products or materials, product recalls, or liability to consumers regarding any of our products that do not meet such regulatory requirements. If any of these events occurs, if our relationship with any of our potential contract manufacturers terminates, or if any such manufacturer is unable fulfill its obligations to us for any reason, our product development and commercialization efforts could suffer and we may never realize a profit.
We face potential product liability exposure, and any claim brought against us may cause us to divert resources from our normal operations or terminate selling, distributing and marketing any product for which we have received regulatory approval. This may cause us to cease our operations as it relates to that product.
The use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval may expose us to product liability claims from consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or other entities. Although we plan to obtain product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials with limits that we hope will be customary and adequate to provide us with coverage for foreseeable risks associated with our product development efforts, our insurance coverage may be insufficient to reimburse us for the actual expenses or losses we may suffer.
If we obtain sufficient financing to proceed with our planned clinical trials, we intend to purchase insurance in amounts customary for trials comparable to our own. To that effect, we intend to consult with industry professionals to determine the optimal amount of coverage. In order to obtain insurance, we must subject our clinical trial protocol to a full review by our eventual insurance provider. The process of binding an insurance policy for a clinical trial can take as long as three months.
We also plan to expand our insurance to cover the commercial sale of products if we obtain the necessary regulatory approval to do so; however, the same product liability risks apply in those circumstances as in clinical trials. Further, even if we are able to successfully defend ourselves against any potential claims, we will likely incur substantial costs in the form of unanticipated expenses and negative publicity. This could result in decreased demand for our product candidates, the withdrawal of clinical trial participants, an impaired business reputation, revenue loss or an inability to commercialize our product candidates. Any of these consequences could cause us to cease our operations.
We face substantial competition in the therapeutic pharmaceutical research and development industry, which could harm our business and our ability to operate profitably.
Our industry is highly competitive, and many of our potential competitors, either alone or together with their partners, have substantially greater financial resources, research and development programs, clinical trial and regulatory experience, expertise in the protection of intellectual property rights, and manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing capabilities than us. As a result, they may be able to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· develop product candidates and market products that are faster to market and thus less expensive, potentially safer, and/or more effective or involve more convenient treatment procedures than our future products; 
· commercialize competing products before we can launch any of our product candidates; 
· initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than us; 
· enjoy greater success in recruiting skilled scientific workers from a limited pool of available talent; and 
· more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic alliances. 
[END TABLE]
All of our product candidates and product development processes will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, and may therefore be the subject of regulatory or enforcement action. The associated costs could prevent us from achieving our goals or becoming profitable.
Our product candidates, clinical data, third-party manufacturing facilities and processes and advertising and promotional activities for any product that receives regulatory approval will be subject to significant review and ongoing and changing regulation by various regulatory agencies. Our failure to comply with any regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, which may include warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production, or the denial of pending product marketing applications.
Even if we receive regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, such approval could be conditional upon our conducting costly post-approval studies or could limit the indicated uses that we are able to include on our product labels. In addition, regulatory or enforcement actions could adversely affect our ability to develop, market and sell our prospective products successfully and harm our reputation, which could lead to reduced market demand for such products. Consequently, the costs associated with any such action could cause our business to suffer and prevent us from achieving our goals or becoming profitable.
Since our directors are located outside of Canada, you may be limited in your ability to enforce Canadian civil actions against them for damages to the value of your investment.
We plan to indemnify our directors and officers against liability to us and our security holders, and such indemnification could increase our operating costs.
Our Articles allow us to indemnify our directors and officers against claims associated with carrying out the duties of their offices. Our Articles also allow us to reimburse them for the costs of certain legal defenses. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under relevant securities legislation may be permitted to our directors, officers or control persons, certain securities regulations may deem that such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable in that jurisdiction.
Since our officers and directors are aware that they may be indemnified for carrying out the duties of their offices, they may be less motivated to meet the standards required by law to properly carry out such duties, which could increase our operating costs. Further, if our officers and directors file a claim against us for indemnification, the associated expenses could also increase our operating costs.
Not all jurisdictions allow for the medicinal use of cannabis and those jurisdictions which allow it could reverse their position.
Certain jurisdictions currently allow the medicinal use of cannabis. Many other jurisdictions do not. There can be no assurance that additional jurisdictions will allow the medicinal use of cannabis or that those jurisdictions which currently allow it will continue to do so. If either of these events occur, then not only will our growth prospects in this field be materially impacted, we may experience a declining market for our products.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
If we are unable to maintain and enforce our proprietary intellectual property rights, we may not be able to operate profitably.
Our commercial success will depend, in part, on obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory protection of our technologies and product candidates as well as successfully defending third-party challenges to such technologies and candidates. We will be able to protect our technologies and product candidates from use by third parties only to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, trade secrets or regulatory protection cover them and we have exclusive rights to use them. The ability of our licensors, collaborators and suppliers to maintain their patent rights against third-party challenges to their validity, scope or enforceability will also play an important role in determining our future.
In addition, our commercial success will depend, in part, on maintaining patent rights we have licensed and plan to license in the future, related to products we may market in the future. Since we will not fully control the patent prosecution of any licensed patent applications, it is possible that our licensors will not devote the same resources or attention to the prosecution of the licensed patent applications as we would if we controlled the prosecution of the applications ourselves. Consequently, the resulting patent protection, if any, may not be as strong or comprehensive as it would be had we done so.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that include unresolved principles and issues. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed regarding such companies' patents has emerged to date in the United States, and the patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict with any certainty the range of claims that may be allowed or enforced concerning our patents or third-party patents.
We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we seek to protect confidential information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our consultants and scientific and other advisors, they may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim against a third party related to the illegal acquisition and use of trade secrets can be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is often unpredictable. If we are not able to maintain patent or trade secret protection on our technologies and product candidates, then we may not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing competing products, and we may not be able to operate profitability.
If we are the subject of an intellectual property infringement claim, the cost of participating in any litigation could cause us to go out of business.
There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation and demands for licenses in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Although we anticipate having a valid defense to any allegation that our current product candidates, production methods and other activities infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of any third parties, we cannot be certain that a third party will not challenge our position in the future. Other parties may own patent rights that we might infringe with our products or other activities, and our competitors or other patent holders may assert that our products and the methods we employ are covered by their patents. These parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial litigation expenses and, if successful, may require us to pay substantial damages. Some of our potential competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation, and depending on the circumstances, we could be forced to stop or delay our research, development, manufacturing or sales activities. Any of these costs could cause us to go out of business.
We may in the future be required to license patent rights from third-party owners in order to develop our products candidates. If we cannot obtain those licenses or if third-party owners do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, we may not be able to market or sell our planned products.
We have licensed patent-protected technologies with Altum Pharmaceuticals Inc. and we may also license other intellectual property from other third parties, if we believe it is necessary or useful to use additional third-party intellectual property to develop our products. Typically, we would seek to negotiate and obtain any required third party licenses immediately following the completion of preliminary research to establish a concept and plan of development for a new product candidate. However, depending on the ongoing results and requirements of pre-clinical or clinical trials, which may unexpectedly vary from our anticipated plan of development, we may be required to seek additional third-party licenses at later stages of product development. We will also be required to pay license fees, certain milestones or royalties or both to obtain such licenses, and there is no guarantee that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to successfully obtain a license, certain rights may be non- or co-exclusive, and this would give our competitors access to some of the intellectual property as us, which could ultimately prevent us from commercializing a product.
Upon obtaining a license, our business prospects will depend, in part, on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection on our licensed intellectual property. Our licensors may terminate our license, may not pursue and successfully prosecute any potential patent infringement claim, may fail to maintain their patent applications, or may pursue any litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property that we license, other companies may be able to offer substantially similar products for sale, and we may not be able to market or sell our planned products or generate any revenues.
If the FDA grants one of our competitors an orphan drug designation for a drug and indication combination that is similar to the drug and indication combination used and targeted by one of our products, we will face significant competition in marketing our product during the seven year exclusivity period.
The FDA grants an orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. An orphan drug designation must be requested before a sponsor submits a New Drug Application to the FDA, and if the FDA grants such a designation the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. An orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process that a drug must undergo; however, if a product that is the subject of an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such a designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity for up to seven years after receiving FDA approval. This means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances.
Therefore, if one of our competitors obtains an orphan drug designation for a drug and indication combination that is identical to the drug and indication combination of one of our products (i.e. the same underlying drug applied to the same indication), our product may not be approved for the same indication for up to seven subsequent years.
Risks Associated with Our Securities
Trading on the OTC Bulletin Board and the Canadian Securities Exchange (the "CSE") may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.
Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and is traded on the CSE. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or listed on the CSE is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Bulletin Board is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like Amex. Accordingly, shareholders may have difficulty reselling any of their shares.
Our stock is a penny stock. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations and FINRA's sales practice requirements, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.
Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States (the "SEC") has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.
In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.
You will experience dilution or subordinated stockholder rights, privileges and preferences as a result of our financing efforts.
We must raise additional capital from external sources to carry out our business plan over the next two years. To do so, we may issue debt securities, equity securities or a combination of these securities; however, we may not be able to sell these securities, particularly under current market conditions. Even if we are successful in finding buyers for our securities, such buyers could demand high interest rates or require us to agree to onerous operating covenants, which could in turn harm our ability to operate our business by reducing our cash flow and restricting our operating activities. If we choose to sell shares of our common stock, this will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. In addition, any shares of common stock we may issue may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of our current stockholders.
We do not intend to pay dividends and there will thus be fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment, if at all.
We have never paid dividends and do not intend to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. To the extent that we may require additional funding currently not provided for in our financing plan, our funding sources may prohibit the declaration of dividends. Because we do not intend to pay dividends, any gain on your investment will need to result from an appreciation in the price of our common stock. There will therefore be fewer ways in which you are able to make a gain on your investment, if at all. There is also no guarantee that your investment will appreciate.
Other Risks
Because one of our directors is located in jurisdictions other than Canada, you may have no effective recourse against the director not located in Canada for misconduct and may not be able to enforce judgment and civil liabilities against this director.
One of our directors is a national and/or resident of a country other than Canada, specifically the Germany. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within Canada any judgments obtained against our director, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of Canada.
Trends, Risks and Uncertainties
We have sought to identify what we believe to be the most significant risks to our business, but we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized nor can we guarantee that we have identified all possible risks that might arise. Investors should carefully consider all of such risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock.

We will require additional funds to fund our budgeted expenses over the next 12 months. These funds may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. There is still no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable. We need to raise additional funds in the immediate future in order to proceed with our budgeted expenses.
Specifically, we estimate our expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Product Development     Estimated Expenses    
 Product Development     Estimated Expenses    
 Development of Thrudermic Topical Tube (20g)       1,590,000

 General and Administrative        1,990,000    
 Total:    $ 24,250,000    
[END TABLE]
Based on our planned expenditures, we will require additional funds of approximately $24.25 million to proceed with our business plan over the next 12 months and the commencement of commercialization of our product initiatives. If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will not be able to carry out our complete business plan and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available financial resources.
Funds raised will be used towards the recruitment of appropriate management and research and development ("R&D") personnel, as well as towards product development expenditures. Specifically, the funds will be used to cover R&D expenses associated with 1) manufacturing scale-up of our products at a GMP-certified, high potency drug manufacturing facility; 2) development and manufacture of formulation of our products at a GMP-certified product manufacturing facility for administration of the drug candidates in animals (for safety evaluation) and subsequently to humans 3) submission to appropriate regulatory authorities for NHP registration.
We anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We have negative cash flows from current operating activities and may continue to be unprofitable. Even if we carry out our expanded research and development activities on our products, there is no guarantee that we will be able to market them or derive any revenues from their sale. 
Although we are anticipating commercialization to commence on some of our product initiatives over the next 12 months, anticipated revenues will not be sufficient to finance our business plan. We intend to raise capital through equity and, if necessary, debt financing. We anticipate that the bulk of any additional funding we receive will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to fund our operations or planned research and development activities. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to carry out our planned research and development activities. Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund our operations and research and development activities, there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced research and development following the completion of our planned clinical trials. If we do not continue to obtain additional financing, we may be forced to abandon our business plan. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on his investment in our common stock. 
Any modifications to our plans will be based on many factors, including the results of our R&D and the amount of available capital. Further, the extent to which we carry out our development of planned products is dependent upon the amount of financing available to us.
Future Financings
We will require additional financing in order to enable us to proceed with our plan of operations, as discussed above, including approximately $24.25 million over the next 12 months to pay for product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. These cash requirements are in excess of our current cash and working capital resources. Accordingly, we will require additional financing in order to continue operations and to repay our liabilities. There is no assurance that any party will advance additional funds to us in order to enable us to sustain our plan of operations or to repay our liabilities. 
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities.
We presently do not have any arrangements for additional financing for the expansion of our operations, and no potential lines of credit or sources of financing are currently available for the purpose of proceeding with our plan of operations.
Contractual Obligations
As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations.
Going Concern
We have not generated any revenues and are dependent upon obtaining outside financing to carry out our operations and pursue our pharmaceutical research and development activities. If we are unable to generate future cash flows, raise equity or secure alternative financing, we may not be able to continue our operations and our business plan may fail. You may lose your entire investment.
If our operations and cash flow improve, management believes that we can continue to operate. However, no assurance can be given that management's actions will result in profitable operations or an improvement in our liquidity situation. The threat of our ability to continue as a going concern will cease to exist only when our revenues have reached a level able to sustain our business operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies 
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management's application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of convertible debentures, assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. Our company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from our company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
Long-lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, "Property, Plant and Equipment", our company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value, which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
Stock-Based Compensation
Our company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock-Based Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments that are not classified as equity and are not used in hedging relationships are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value are recorded in the statement of operations. 
Income Taxes
Our company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Our company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, our company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.
Our company files federal and provincial income tax returns in Canada. Our company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in tax expense. During the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no charges for interest or penalties.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 - Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Our company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible debenture. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of our parent entity, Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pivot Green Stream Health Solutions Inc., is the Canadian dollar. Our company's presentation currency is the US dollar. 
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. 
Results of operations are translated into our company's presentation currency, US dollars, at an appropriate average rate of exchange during the year. Net assets and liabilities are translated to US dollars for presentation purposes at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the period. Gains or losses arising on translation are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 
(Expressed in U.S. dollars)
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc.:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("the Company") as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended January 31, 2018 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended January 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Supplemental cash flow disclosures (Note 13)
(The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements)
PIVOT PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Year ended January 31, 2017
(Expressed in U.S. dollars)
Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act on June 10, 2002. On April 7, 2015, the Company changed its name from Neurokine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Company is in the business of developing and commercializing therapeutic pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, as well as drug delivery platform technologies. 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at January 31, 2018, the Company has not earned any revenue, has a working capital deficit of $279,947 and an accumulated deficit of $20,718,935. The continued operations of the Company are dependent on its ability to generate future cash flows or obtain additional financing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (a) Basis of Presentation 
    The consolidated financial statements and the related notes of the Company are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and are expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company's fiscal year-end is January 31. 
   (b) Use of Estimates 
    The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the fair values of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. 
   (c) Basis of Consolidation 
    The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The consolidating entities include:

[BEGIN TABLE]
   (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. As at January 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no cash equivalents. 
   (e) Intangible Asset 
    Intangible assets consists of costs incurred to acquire a license. Intangible assets are considered finite live assets and recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Subsequent expenditures are capitalized only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the asset. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method and is intended to amortize the license over its estimated useful life of four years. 
   (f) Stock-Based Compensation 
    The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock-Based Compensation, using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. 
   (g) Derivative Financial Instruments 
    Derivative financial instruments that are not classified as equity and are not used in hedging relationships are measured at fair value. Subsequent changes to fair value are recorded in the statement of operations and comprehensive income. 
   (h) Loss Per Share 
     The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the consolidated statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at January 31, 2018, the Company has excluded 6,153,764 (2017 – 6,840,834) potential dilutive shares. 
   (i) Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
     ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the consolidated financial statements. As at January 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's comprehensive income included foreign currency translation adjustments. 
   (j) Research and Development Costs 
    Research costs are expensed in the period that they are incurred.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (k) Income Taxes 
    The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions. 
    The Company files federal and provincial income tax returns in Canada. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in tax expense. During the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no charges for interest or penalties. 
   (l) Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures 
     ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 
[END TABLE]
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and promissory note. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, and the fair value of derivative liabilities is determined based on "Level 3" inputs. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.

   (m) Foreign Currency Translation 
    The functional currency of the parent entity, Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc., and the wholly-owned subsidiary, Pivot Green Stream Health Solutions Inc., is the Canadian dollar. The Company's presentation currency is the US dollar. 
    Monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Expenses are translated at average rates for the period. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. 
    Results of operations are translated into the Company's presentation currency, US dollars, at an appropriate average rate of exchange during the year. Net assets and liabilities are translated to US dollars for presentation purposes at rates of exchange in effect at the end of the period. Gains or losses arising on translation are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) as foreign currency translation adjustments. 
   (n) Reclassifications 
    We have made reclassifications to certain numbers reported in the prior year to conform to the presentation of the current year. 
   (o) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
[END TABLE]
3. Disposal of Asset
On September 11, 2017, the Company completed an exchange agreement whereby the Company exchanged with its past Chief Executive Officer 100% of its shares of common stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, IndUS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("IndUS"), for 3,800,000 shares of common stock of the Company (Note 9(b)). Pursuant to the exchange agreement, the Company has provided its former Chief Executive Officer a promissory note (Note 8(a)) in the amount of $200,000 in discharge of all obligations with respect to Dr. Chaturvedi's accrued salary totaling $267,267 through September 11, 2017 for which a gain of $102,259 has been included in gain on settlement of debts in the statement of operations. 
The disposal of IndUS resulted in a gain as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 3,800,000 shares of common stock acquired and cancelled    $ 380,000    
 Net liabilities exchanged       229,311    
 Gain on disposal of asset    $ 609,311    
[END TABLE]
The disposal of IndUS did not meet the definition of discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.

6. Convertible Debenture
On September 30, 2016, the Company issued a convertible debenture with a non-related party for $500,000 Canadian Dollars ($380,411 US Dollars at September 30, 2016) ("Initial Advance"). The debenture is secured under a General Security Agreement, bears interest at 8% per annum and matures on the earlier of:

· The date the lender demands repayment of principal and interest following an event of default, 
· The date of a dissolution event, 
· The date of a liquidity event, and 
· March 30, 2017. 
[END TABLE]
The Company may request one or more additional advances of up to an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 Canadian Dollars ("Additional Advances") provided that the aggregate amount under the convertible debenture does not exceed $1,500,000 Canadian Dollars. 
The note, including the Initial Advance and any Additional Advances, is convertible into common shares at a conversion price equal to the average closing market price of the Company's common stock during the five day period leading up to the conversion date. The Company recorded the conversion feature of the convertible debenture as a derivative liability at an estimated fair value of $134,892 with a corresponding discount to the convertible debenture (Note 7). 
Pursuant to the convertible loan agreement, the Company issued 434,622 share purchase warrants to which the lender may acquire an interest in the Company equal to 12% of the maximum principal amount outstanding at any time at a price of $0.10 per share, which equates to the ten day average trading price of the Company's common stock determined as at September 30, 2016. The Company calculated the 434,622 share purchase warrants based on the maximum outstanding principal balance on the convertible loan as of September 30, 2016. The Company recorded the share purchase warrant at an estimated fair value of $20,154 with a corresponding discount to the convertible debenture (Note 11).
On September 18, 2017, the lender converted the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the convertible debenture into 4,623,825 shares of common stock (Note 9(d)) of the Company at a conversion price of $0.10. A loss on conversion of debenture of $21,236 was recorded within gain on settlement of debts in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods, including the interim period up through the date the relationship ended.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 31, 2018 and determined that they were not effective.
Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our president (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018, our company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1. We did not maintain appropriate financial reporting controls – As of January 31, 2018, our company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the financial reporting process. As at January 31, 2018, our company did not have sufficient financial reporting controls with respect to the segregation of incompatible duties related to the ability to post adjusting journal entries and access to our company's assets. 
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, our company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls.
As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that our company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC, our independent registered public auditors, was not required to and has not issued an attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2018 pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only management's report in this annual report.
Changes in Internal Controls
During the period ended January 31, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Family Relationships
There are no other family relationships between any of our directors, executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers. 
Conflicts of Interest
Dr. Doroudian is a co-founder and chief executive officer of Altum Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company engaged in the research, development and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical products.
Dr. Renz is president of international business at Physicians Interactive and also serves as adjunct professor of surgery at McGill University's Faculty of Medicine in Montreal, Canada.
While we do not anticipate that these activities will compete with our business, Dr. Doroudian and Dr. Renz may have pre-existing fiduciary duties with one or more organizations and may not agree to present business opportunities or research data to us unless other entities have first declined to accept them or consented to their release. Accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
Our directors are not obligated to commit their time and attention exclusively to our business and, accordingly, they may encounter a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and those of other businesses. Our directors devote their time on an as needed basis. All of our directors, in the course of their other business activities, may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as other entities to which they owe a fiduciary duty. As a result, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. They may also in the future become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. 
In general, officers and directors of a corporation are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity; 
· the opportunity is within the corporation's line of business; and 
· it would be unfair to the corporation and its stockholders not to bring the opportunity to the attention of the corporation. 
[END TABLE]
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten years:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1. been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offences); 
   2. had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years prior to that time; 
   3. been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated with persons engaged in any such activity; 
   4. been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated; 
   5. been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 
   6. been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member. 
[END TABLE]
Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Accordingly, our officers, directors, and principal stockholders are not subject to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
Code of Ethics
Effective April 20, 2011, our company's board of directors adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to, among other persons, members of our board of directors, our company's officers including our president, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, employees, consultants and advisors. As adopted, our code of business conduct and ethics sets forth written standards that are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 
Our code of business conduct and ethics requires, among other things, that all of our company's senior officers commit to timely, accurate and consistent disclosure of information; that they maintain confidential information; and that they act with honesty and integrity. 
In addition, our code of business conduct and ethics emphasizes that all employees, and particularly senior officers, have a responsibility for maintaining financial integrity within our company, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, and federal and state securities laws. Any senior officer who becomes aware of any incidents involving financial or accounting manipulation or other irregularities, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to our company. Any failure to report such inappropriate or irregular conduct of others is to be treated as a severe disciplinary matter. It is against our company policy to retaliate against any individual who reports in good faith the violation or potential violation of our company's code of business conduct and ethics by another. 
Our code of business conduct and ethics was included as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on May 11, 2011. We will provide a copy of the code of business conduct and ethics to any person without charge, upon request. Requests can be sent to: Pivot Pharmaceuticals Inc., 1275 West 6th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia V6H 1A6.
Committees of the Board
All proceedings of our board of directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the corporate laws of the state of Nevada and the bylaws of our company, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held. 
Our company currently does not have nominating, compensation committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our directors.
Our company does not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The directors believe that, given the early stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the board of directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our directors assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment. 
A shareholder who wishes to communicate with our board of directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our president, at the address appearing on the first page of this annual report. 
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
Our board of directors has determined that none of our the members of our audit committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Dr. Wolfgang Renz is "independent" as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
Our company has a formal audit committee which was formed in May 2010, but currently does not have a financial expert. Our audit committee consists of Dr. Patrick Frankham, Dr. Wolfgang Renz and Dr. Ahmad Doroudian. Financial information relating to quarterly reports was disseminated to all board members for review. The audited financial statements for the years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 were provided to each member of the board in which any concerns by the members were directed to management and the auditors. 
We believe that the members of our board of audit committee and our entire board of directors are collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.
Our company has an audit committee charter which was adopted and approved by our board of directors on May 25, 2010. 
Item 11. Executive Compensation
The particulars of the compensation paid to the following persons:
who we will collectively refer to as the named executive officers of our company, are set out in the following summary compensation table, except that no disclosure is provided for any named executive officer, other than our principal executive officers, whose total compensation did not exceed $100,000 for the respective fiscal year:
