NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held on May 6, 2019 
March 18, 2019 
To the Stockholders of Healthcare Trust, Inc.:
I am pleased to invite our stockholders to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Annual Meeting") of Healthcare Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"). The Annual Meeting will be held on Monday, May 6, 2019 at The Core Club, located at 66 E. 55th Street, New York, NY 10022, commencing at 3:30 p.m. (local time). At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon (1) the election of two members of the Board of Directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2022 Annual Meeting") and until their successors are duly elected and qualify, (2) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and (3) the transaction of such other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof. Our Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 15, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Record holders of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting.
The Company is relying on Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow it to furnish proxy materials to you via the Internet. The Company may send you the proxy materials, send you a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and make the proxy materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered or will deliver printed versions of the proxy materials to you by mail.
For further information regarding the matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting, I urge you to carefully read the accompanying proxy statement. The Company makes proxy materials available to its stockholders on the Internet. You can access proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com/HTI. You also may authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on that website. In order to authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone, you must have the stockholder identification number that appears on the materials sent to you. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may vote in person if you wish, even if you previously have submitted your proxy. Your attendance alone, without voting, will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized proxy.
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Regardless of whether you own a few or many shares and whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person or not, it is important that your shares be voted on matters that come before the Annual Meeting. Your vote is important. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
/s/ Katie P. Kurtz

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING 
We are providing you with this Proxy Statement, which contains information about the items to be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting. To make this information easier to understand, we have presented some of the information in a question-and-answer format. 
Q:
Why did you send me a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or this Proxy Statement? 
​
A:
We may send you this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card, make this Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and our 2018 10-K available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered or will deliver printed versions of these proxy materials to you by mail because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is designed to assist you in voting. You can access this Proxy Statement and the other proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com/HTI. We are relying on SEC rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to you via the Internet. You may have received or may receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This Notice contains instructions on how to access proxy materials and authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or, if you prefer, to request a printed set of proxy materials at no additional cost to you. You may authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on that website. 
​
Q:
Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? 
​
A:
No. The Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials you may receive in the mail identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, but you cannot vote by marking this Notice and returning it. This Notice will provide instructions on how to authorize your proxy by Internet or by telephone, by requesting and returning a paper proxy card, or by submitting a ballot in person at the meeting. 
​
Q:
What is a proxy? 
​
A:
A proxy is a person who votes the shares of stock of another person who could not attend a meeting. The term "proxy" also refers to the proxy card or other method of appointing a proxy. When you submit your proxy, you are appointing Edward M. Weil, Jr. and Katie P. Kurtz, each of whom are executive officers of the Company, as your proxies, and you are giving them permission to vote your shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at the Annual Meeting. 
​
Q:
When is the Annual Meeting and where will it be held? 
​
A:
The Annual Meeting will be held on Monday, May 6, 2019, at 3:30 p.m. (local time) at The Core Club, located at 66 E. 55th Street, New York, NY 10022. 
​
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to: 
​
 elect Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny as the Class II directors to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; 
​
 ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and 
​
 consider and act on such matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
Who is entitled to vote?
​
A:
Anyone who is a holder of record of Common Stock at the close of business on March 15, 2019 (the "record date"), or holds a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting, is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. Every stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on the record date. 
​
Q:
How many shares of Common Stock are outstanding?
​
A:
As of the record date, 91,986,536 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
​
Q:
What constitutes a "quorum"?
​
A:
If holders of a majority of our shares of our Common Stock outstanding on the record date are present at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, we will have a quorum present, permitting the conduct of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted to determine whether a quorum is present. 
​
Q:
What is a "broker non-vote"?
​
A:
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner submits a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the election of directors or for the approval of other matters which applicable exchange rules determine to be "non-routine," without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. Thus, beneficial owners of shares held in broker accounts are advised that, if they do not timely provide instructions to their broker, their shares will not be voted in connection with the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. However, even without these instructions, the shares of beneficial owners will be treated as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum if the broker votes shares on the ratification of the appointment of PwC, which is a routine matter with respect to which brokers have discretionary authority to vote. 
​
Q:
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on each proposal? 
​
A:
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the election of Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny as the Class II directors and a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PwC. 
​
Q:
How do I vote?
​
A:
Stockholders can vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. Stockholders have the following three options for submitting their votes by proxy: 
​
 via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com/HTI ; 
​
 by telephone, for automated voting (800) 690-6903 at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. on May 5, 2019, and follow the instructions provided on the proxy card; or 
​
 if proxy materials were sent to you or if you requested a printed set of proxy materials, by mail, by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card. 
​
For those stockholders with Internet access, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet, since it is quick, convenient and provides a cost savings to us. When you authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone prior to the meeting date, your vote is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your proxy authorization to arrive late and, therefore, not have your vote be counted. For further instructions on voting, see the enclosed proxy card or the Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
If you elect to attend the Annual Meeting, you can submit your vote in person, and any previous proxy that you authorized, whether by Internet, telephone or mail, will be superseded. If you return your signed proxy, your shares will be voted as you instruct, unless you give no instructions with respect to one or more of the proposals. In this case, unless you later instruct otherwise, your shares of Common Stock will be voted "FOR" the election of Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny as the Class II directors and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PwC. With respect to any other proposals to be voted on, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the discretion of Mr. Weil and Ms. Kurtz, or either of them. 
Q:
How do I vote if I hold my shares in "street name"? 
​
A:
If your shares are held by your bank, broker or other nominee as your nominee (in "street name"), you should receive a voting instruction form in paper, or electronic means to provide instructions, from the institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If your broker holds your shares of Common Stock in street name and you do not provide your broker with instructions, your broker will vote your shares on "non-routine" proposals only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker. Of the proposals expected to come before the Annual Meeting, only ratification of the appointment of PwC is considered a routine matter. The proposal to elect directors is a "non-routine" matter, and, without your instruction, your broker cannot vote your shares on that proposal. 
​
If your shares are held in street name and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and/or vote in person, you must bring your broker or bank voting instruction card and a proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares. In addition, you must bring valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or a passport. 
Q:
What if I submit my proxy and then change my mind?
​
A:
You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by: 
​
 notifying Ms. Kurtz, our Secretary, in writing; 
​
 attending the meeting and voting in person; 
​
 returning another proxy card dated after your first proxy card, if we receive it before the Annual Meeting date; or 
​
 authorizing a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone to vote your shares. 
​
Only the most recent proxy vote will be counted and all others will be discarded regardless of the method of voting. 
Q:
Will my vote make a difference?
​
A:
Yes. Because we are a widely held company, YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expenses associated with soliciting stockholder votes. 
​
Q:
What are the voting requirements to elect the Board of Director nominees? 
​
A:
There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors. The election of our nominees for director requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of all of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present, in person or by proxy. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. For purposes of the election of directors, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any are applicable, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
What are the voting requirements to approve the proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019?
​
A:
The proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all the votes cast on the proposal at a meeting at which a quorum is present. For purposes of ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any are applicable, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
​
Q:
How will proxies be voted?
​
A:
Shares of Common Stock represented by valid proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions given. If the proxy card is signed and returned without any directions given, the shares will be voted "FOR" (1) the election of Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny as the Class II directors to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; and (2) the ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
​
The Board of Directors does not intend to present, and has no information indicating that others will present, any business at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof other than as set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if other matters requiring the vote of our stockholders properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy card to vote the proxies held by them in their discretion. 
Q:
How will voting on any other business be conducted?
​
A:
Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement, if any other business is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, a submitted proxy gives authority to Mr. Weil and Ms. Kurtz, and each of them, to vote on such matters in accordance with their discretion. 
​
Q:
When are the stockholder proposals for the next annual meeting of stockholders due? 
​
A:
Stockholders interested in nominating a person as a director or presenting any other business for consideration at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting") may do so by following the procedures prescribed in our bylaws and, in the case of proposals within the scope of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), following the procedures specified by that rule. To be eligible for presentation to and action by the stockholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting under our bylaws, director nominations and other stockholder proposals must be received by our secretary no earlier than October 20, 2019 and no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 19, 2019. Any proposal received after the applicable time in the previous sentence will be considered untimely. All proposals must contain the information specified in, and otherwise comply with, our bylaws. To be eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholder proposals must comply with Rule 14a-8 and be received at our principal executive offices no later than November 19, 2019. Proposals should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to: Healthcare Trust, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Katie P. Kurtz, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. For additional information, see "Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting." 
​
Q:
Who pays the cost of this proxy solicitation?
​
A:
We will pay all of the costs of soliciting these proxies. We have contracted with Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies. We expect to pay Broadridge fees of approximately $20,000 to distribute and solicit proxies plus other fees and expenses for other services related to this proxy solicitation, including the review of proxy materials; dissemination of brokers' search cards; distribution of proxy materials; 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
operating online and telephone voting systems; and receipt of executed proxies. In compliance with the regulations of the SEC, we will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to the extent they forward proxy and solicitation materials to our stockholders. Our directors and officers and employees of affiliates of our advisor, Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), may solicit proxies on our behalf in person or by telephone, facsimile or other means, for which they will not receive any additional compensation. 
Q:
Is this Proxy Statement the only way that proxies are being solicited? 
​
A:
No. In addition to mailing proxy solicitation material, our directors and officers and employees of Broadridge and affiliates of the Advisor, may also solicit proxies in person, via the Internet, by telephone or by any other electronic means of communication we deem appropriate. 
​
Q:
Where can I find more information?
​
A:
You may access, read and print copies of the proxy materials for this year's Annual Meeting, including this Proxy Statement, form of proxy card, and annual report to stockholders, at the following website: www.proxyvote.com/HTI. 
​
You can request a paper or electronic copy of the proxy materials, free of charge: 
 via Internet, at www.proxyvote.com/HTI; 
​
 via telephone, at (800) 579-1639; or 
​
 via e-mail, at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. 
​
We also file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statements or other information we file with the SEC on the web site maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings also are available to the public at the SEC's Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. You also may obtain copies of the documents at prescribed rates by writing to the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information regarding the public reference facilities. 
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction form? 
​
A:
Some of your shares of Common Stock may be registered differently or held in a different account. You should vote the shares in each of your accounts by mail, by telephone or via the Internet. If you mail proxy cards, please sign, date and return each proxy card to guarantee that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted. If you hold your shares in registered form and wish to combine your stockholder accounts in the future, you should call our Investor Relations department at (866) 902-0063. Combining accounts reduces excess printing and mailing costs, resulting in cost savings to us that benefit you as a stockholder. 
​
Q:
What if I receive only one set of proxy materials although there are multiple stockholders at my address? 
​
A:
The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of documents filed by us with the SEC, including proxy statements and annual reports. The rule allows us to send a single set of any annual report, proxy statement, proxy statement combined with a prospectus, notices or information statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family. This procedure is referred to as "Householding." This rule benefits both you and us by reducing the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps us reduce expenses. Each stockholder subject to Householding will continue to have a separate stockholder identification number and receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
​
We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of our 2018 10-K, this Proxy Statement or a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy was previously delivered. If you received a single set of  TABLE OF CONTENTS
disclosure documents for this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies by calling our Investor Relations department at (866) 902-0063 or by mailing a request to Healthcare Trust, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Investor Relations. Likewise, if your household currently receives multiple copies of disclosure documents and you would like to receive one set, please contact us. 
Q:
Whom should I call with other questions?
​
A:
If you have additional questions about this Proxy Statement or the Annual Meeting or would like additional copies of this Proxy Statement, our 2018 10-K or any documents relating to any of our future stockholder meetings, please contact: Healthcare Trust, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York, 10022, Attention: Investor Relations, Telephone: (866) 902-0063, E-mail: investorrelations@ar-global.com, website: www.healthcaretrustinc.com.

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and supervising the performance of our day-to-day operations and our Advisor. The Advisor is controlled by AR Global Investments, LLC ("AR Global"). Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Each director serves until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of his or her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. At the Annual Meeting, two Class II directors will be elected to serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. The number of directors in each class may be changed from time to time by the Board to reflect matters such as an increase or decrease in the number of directors so that each class, to the extent possible, will have the same number of directors. Our bylaws provide that the number of directors may not be less than one, which is the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), nor more than 15. The number of directors on our Board is currently fixed at five, of which four are independent directors. 
Board of Directors and Executive Officers 
The table set forth below lists the names, ages and certain other information about Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny, our Class II directors with terms expiring at the Annual Meeting (who are also nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting), for each of the continuing members of our Board and for each of our executive officers:

On March 8, 2017, the creditor trust established in connection with the RCAP bankruptcy filed suit against AR Global, the parent of our Advisor, our Advisor, advisors of other entities sponsored by the parent, and the parent's principals (including Mr. Weil). The suit alleges, among other things, certain breaches of duties to RCAP. The Company is neither a party to the suit, nor are there any allegations related to the services the Advisor provides to it.

On November 5, 2018, the defendants moved for leave to amend their answers and for partial summary judgment on certain of the claims at issue in the case. The creditor trust opposed the motion, and it was argued before the court on February 6, 2019. The court has not yet ruled on the motion. On January 18, 2019, the defendants requested that the scheduling order governing the case be modified to bifurcate liability and damages issues for discovery purposes and trial.

Information About the Board of Directors and its Committees 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management and control of our business and operations. Our current executive officers are employees of affiliates of the Advisor. We have no employees and have retained the Advisor to manage our day-to-day operations. The Advisor is under common control with AR Global. Mr. Weil, one of our directors, is the chief executive officer of AR Global and has a non-controlling interest in the parent of AR Global.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
The Board of Directors held a total of 13 meetings and took action by written consent or electronically on 14 occasions during the year ended December 31, 2018. Each of our directors attended at least 96% of the meetings held while they were a member of the Board of Directors. All of our directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. We encourage all directors to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. 
The Board of Directors has approved and formed an audit committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The Company does not currently have a compensation committee or a conflicts committee, but the nominating and corporate governance committee carries out the responsibilities typically associated with a compensation committee or a conflicts committee. 
Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors 
Leslie D. Michelson, an independent director, currently serves as our non-executive chairman of the Board. Edward M. Weil, Jr. serves as our chief executive officer and president. 
As non-executive chairman, Mr. Michelson organizes the work of the Board and presides over meetings of the Board. In addition, Mr. Michelson is involved in our strategy and operations, and he is expected to devote a significant amount of his time to the Company in this capacity. Mr. Michelson's responsibilities include, among others: (i) driving organizational strategy with the chief executive officer and other officers, responding to changes in the healthcare industry, in addition to setting Board strategy and objectives; (ii) meeting with key advisory and strategic relationships (credit and lending, accounting and audit, and investment banking), as well as key tenants and clients; (iii) consistently monitoring our portfolio performance and serving as the principal liaison between the chief executive officer and the Board to communicate business and management topics; and (iv) consulting and communicating alongside the chief executive officers with shareholders. 
As chief executive officer and president, Mr. Weil works in coordination with Mr. Michelson as they are both responsible for our strategy and operations. The Board believes that its leadership structure, which separates the non-executive chair and chief executive officer roles but also provides for collaborative work on strategy and operations, is appropriate at this time. The goal of the division of authority and responsibilities is to capitalize on Mr. Michelson's extensive experience with, knowledge of and influence in the industry, allowing Mr. Weil to focus on managing the business. The Board of Directors may modify this structure to best address our circumstances for the benefit of our stockholders when appropriate. 
We believe that having a majority of independent, experienced directors, including having an independent director serve as our non-executive chair, provides the right leadership structure and corporate governance structure for the Company and is best for the Company at this time. Mr. Michelson, in his capacity as non-executive chair of the Board, presides over any executive sessions of the independent directors. 
Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board of Directors has an active role in overseeing the management of risks applicable to the Company. The entire Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company through its approval of all property acquisitions and incurrence and assumption of debt and its oversight of the Company's executive officers and the Advisor. The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews and approves transactions with related parties such as the Advisor, AR Global and their affiliates, and resolves other conflicts of interest between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director, the Advisor or AR Global or their respective affiliates, on the other hand. The audit committee oversees management of accounting, financial, legal and regulatory risks.

Our nominating and corporate governance committee held three meetings and took action by written consent or electronically on one occasion during the year ended December 31, 2018. Members of the nominating and corporate governance committee attended all of the meetings of the nominating and corporate governance committee while they were a member of the nominating and corporate governance committee.

The principal functions of the nominating and corporate governance committee, which also carries out responsibilities typically carried out by a compensation committee and a conflicts committee, are to: 
 identify qualified individuals to become directors of the Company; 
​
 recommend director candidates to fill vacancies on the Board and to stand for election by the stockholders at the annual meeting; 
​
 recommend committee assignments; 
​
 periodically assess the performance of the Board of Directors; 
​

​
 approve and evaluate all compensation plans, policies and programs, if any, as they affect the Company's executive officers; 
​
 review and oversee the Company's annual process, if any, for evaluating the performance of the Company's executive officers;

​
 assist the Board and the non-executive chair of the Company in overseeing the development of executive succession plans; 
​
 determine from time to time the remuneration for the Company's independent directors; and 
​
 for those actions and transactions brought to the attention of the nominating and corporate governance committee in which we, on the one hand, and any of AR Global, the Advisor, a director, an officer or any affiliate thereof, on the other hand, are involved, the nominating and corporate governance committee has the authority to: 
​
 review and evaluate the terms and conditions, and determine the advisability of the transaction and conflict of interest situations between us and the other party; 
​
 negotiate the terms and conditions of the transaction, and, if the nominating and corporate governance committee deems appropriate, but subject to the limitations of applicable law, approve the execution and delivery of documents in connection with that transaction on our behalf; 
​
 determine whether the transaction is fair to, and in the best interest of us; 
​
 recommend to the Board of Directors what action, if any should be taken by the Board of Directors with respect to the transaction; and 
​
 review, on a quarterly basis, the services provided by the Advisor, the reasonableness of the Advisor's or its affiliates' fees and expenses, the reasonableness of the Company's expenses and the allocation of expenses among the Company and its affiliates and among accounting categories, and report its findings to the Board. 
​
In making its determinations, the Board reviews the appropriate experience, skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of our business. This review includes, in the context of the perceived needs of the Board at that time, issues of knowledge, experience, judgment and skills relating to the understanding of the real estate industry, accounting or financial expertise. This review also includes the candidate's ability to attend regular Board meetings in person or by phone and to devote a sufficient amount of time and effort in preparation for these meetings. The Board also considers the desirability of having a diverse and appropriate mix of backgrounds and skills on the Board and each nominee's ability to exercise independence of thought, objective perspective and mature judgment and understand our business operations and objectives. The Board of Directors believes that diversity is an important attribute of the members who comprise our Board of Directors and that the members should represent an array of backgrounds and experiences. 
The Board of Directors will consider candidates nominated by stockholders provided that the stockholder submitting a nomination has complied with procedures set forth in the bylaws. See "Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting" for additional information regarding stockholder nominations of director candidates. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee has determined that all related party transactions during the year ended December 31, 2018 and during the period from January 1, 2019 through the date of this Proxy Statement, which consisted of our transactions with our Advisor, AR Global and their respective affiliates, during the year ended December 31, 2018 were fair to, and in the best interest of us. All related party transactions were approved in accordance with the applicable Company policies consistent with the charter of the nominating and corporate governance committee. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

In the opinion of the Board of Directors, each of  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
We have no employees. Our Advisor performs our day-to-day management functions. Our current executive officers, Edward M. Weil, Jr. and Katie P. Kurtz, are each employees of affiliates of the Advisor and Property Manager and do not receive any compensation directly from us for serving as our executive officers. We do not determine the compensation paid by our Advisor or its affiliates to our named executive officers. Our Advisor and its affiliates determine the salaries, bonuses and other benefits earned by our named executive officers from our Advisor and its affiliates. We do not have, and our Board of Directors has not considered, a compensation policy or program for our executive officers and has not included in this Proxy Statement a "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," a report with respect to executive compensation, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on compensation of executives, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation or a ratio of the compensation of our chief executive officer to our median employee.
We have not reimbursed our Advisor or its affiliates that are involved in managing our operations, including the Property Manager, for salaries, bonuses or benefits incurred by these entities and paid to our executive officers. We understand, however, that our Advisor may seek reimbursement for certain of these expenses in the future, although the amount of these reimbursements is currently unknown and is subject to further discussion between our Advisor and our independent directors. Any reimbursement for salaries, bonuses or benefits paid to employees of our Advisor will be subject to a determination by the independent directors comprising our nominating and corporate governance committee that the reimbursement is reasonable.
See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" for a discussion of fees and expense reimbursements payable to the Advisor, the Property Manager and their affiliates.
Compensation of Directors 
We pay to each of our independent directors the fees described below. If a director is our employee or an employee of our Advisor or any of its affiliates, we do not pay compensation for services rendered as a director. All directors also receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and its committees. 
We pay our independent directors a yearly retainer of  $30,000 and an additional yearly retainer of $55,000 for the lead independent director or non-executive chair; $2,000 for all meetings personally attended by the directors ($2,500 for attendance by the chairperson of the audit committee at each meeting of the audit committee) and $1,500 for each meeting attended via telephone; $750 per transaction reviewed and voted upon electronically up to a maximum of  $2,250 for three or more transactions reviewed and voted upon per meeting. If there is a Board meeting and one or more committee meetings in one day, the director's fees cannot exceed $2,500 ($3,000 for the chairperson of the audit committee if there is a meeting of such committee). In addition, from April 2017 through December 2018, our non-executive chairman received a monthly retainer of  $25,000 to be paid, and our independent directors have approved the continued payment for this monthly retainer from January 2019 through December 2019. 
Prior to August 2017, our restricted share plan (as amended, the "RSP") provided for an automatic grant of 1,333 restricted shares of Common Stock to each of the independent directors, without any further approval by the Board or our stockholders, on the date of his or her initial election to the Board and thereafter on the date of each annual stockholder meeting. The restricted shares granted as annual automatic awards prior to August 2017 were subject to vesting in equal increments over a five-year period with initial vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant. 
In August 2017, the Board amended the RSP to provide that the number of restricted shares comprising the automatic annual award to each of the independent directors would be equal to the quotient of  $30,000 divided by the then-current estimated per-share net asset value of our Common Stock and subsequently amended and restated the RSP to eliminate the automatic annual awards and to make other revisions related to the implementation of a new independent director equity compensation program. As  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
part of this new independent director equity compensation program, the Board approved a one-time grant of restricted share awards to the independent directors as follows: (i) 300,000 restricted shares to the non-executive chairman, with one-seventh of the shares vesting annually in equal increments over a seven-year period with initial vesting on August 4, 2018; and (ii) 25,000 restricted shares to each of the three other independent directors, with one-fifth of the shares vesting annually in equal increments over a five-year period with initial vesting on August 4, 2018. In connection with these one-time grants, the restricted shares granted as automatic annual awards in connection with our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders on July 21, 2017 were forfeited. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any distributions payable in shares of Common Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares. 
We also pay each independent director for each external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event attended in person and in which the independent director actively participates, solely in his or her capacity as an independent director of the Company, in the following amounts: 
 $2,500 for each day of an external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event that does not exceed four hours, or 
​
 $5,000 for each day of an external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event that exceeds four hours. 
​
In either of the above cases, we will reimburse, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed, an independent director's reasonable expenses associated with attendance at such external seminars, conferences, panels, forums or other industry-related events. An independent director cannot be paid or reimbursed for attendance at a single external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event by us and another company for which he or she is a director.

Share-Based Compensation 
Restricted Share Plan 
The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The total number of shares granted as awards under the RSP shall not exceed 5.0% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis at any time and in any event will not exceed 3.4 million shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events). As of December 31, 2018, we had 91,963,532 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 394,000 shares of Common Stock that were subject to awards granted under the RSP. 
Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of our Common Stock under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives. Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with us. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any distributions payable in shares of our Common Stock are subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Edward M. Weil, Jr., our chief executive officer, president and one of our directors, also is the chief executive officer and president of our Advisor and our Property Manager. Katie P. Kurtz, our chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary, is also the chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary of our Advisor and our Property Manager. When he served as our chief executive officer and president, prior to his departure in September 2018, W. Todd Jensen also served as the chief executive officer and president of our Advisor and our Property Manager. 
Our Advisor and our Property Manager are owned and controlled directly or indirectly by AR Global. Mr. Weil is the chief executive officer of AR Global and has a non-controlling interest in the parent of AR Global. 
Prior to being liquidated and dissolved on March 8, 2019, HT III was sponsored and advised by affiliates of the Advisor. Mr. Jensen and Ms. Kurtz were also officers of HT III, the HT III advisor and the HT III property manager. Mr. Weil was also a member of HT III's board of directors. The HT III advisor and the HT III property manager, as well as the sponsor of HT III, were under common control with AR Global. 
Advisor 
Pursuant to our advisory agreement with the Advisor (as amended from time to time, the "Advisory Agreement"), the Advisor manages our day-to-day operations. The initial term of the current Advisory Agreement ends on February 17, 2027, and is automatically renewable for another ten-year term upon each ten-year anniversary unless the agreement is terminated (1) with notice of an election not to renew at least 365 days prior to the applicable tenth anniversary, (2) in accordance with a Change of Control (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) or a transition to self-management, (3) by 67% of the independent directors of the Board of Directors for cause, without penalty, with 45 days' notice or (4) with 60 days prior written notice by the Advisor for (a) a failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement for any successor to the Company to assume and agree to perform obligations under the Advisory Agreement or (b) any material breach of the Advisory Agreement of any nature whatsoever by the Company. 
Asset Management Fees and Variable Management/Incentive Fees 
The Advisory Agreement requires the Company to pay the Advisor a base management fee, which is payable on the first business day of each month. The fixed portion of the base management fee is equal to $1.625 million per month, while the variable portion of the base management fee is equal to one-twelfth of 1.25% of the cumulative net proceeds of any equity (including convertible equity and certain convertible debt but excluding proceeds from the Company's distribution reinvestment plan) issued by the Company and its subsidiaries subsequent to February 17, 2017 per month. The base management fee is payable to the Advisor or its assignees in cash, OP Units or shares, or a combination thereof, the form of payment to be determined at the discretion of the Advisor and the value of any OP Unit or share to be determined by the Advisor acting in good faith on the basis of such quotations and other information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment, appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $19.5 million in cash base asset management fees to the Advisor, of which no amounts remained unpaid as of December 31, 2018. 
In addition, the Advisory Agreement requires the Company to pay the Advisor a variable management/incentive fee quarterly in arrears equal to (1) the product of fully diluted number of shares of Common Stock outstanding multiplied by (2) (x) 15.0% of the applicable prior quarter's Core Earnings (as defined below) per share in excess of  $0.375 per share plus (y) 10.0% of the applicable prior quarter's Core Earnings per share in excess of  $0.47 per share. "Core Earnings" is defined as, for the applicable period, net income or loss, computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"), excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the variable management/incentive fee, acquisition and transaction related fees and expenses, financing related fees and expenses, depreciation and amortization, realized gains and losses on the sale of assets, any unrealized gains or losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income or loss for the applicable period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP  TABLE OF CONTENTS
and certain non-cash charges, impairment losses on real estate related investments and other than temporary impairments of securities, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of tenant inducements, amortization of straight-line rent and any associated bad debt reserves, amortization of market lease intangibles, provision for loss loans, and other non-recurring revenue and expenses (in each case after discussions between the Advisor and the independent directors and approved by a majority of the independent directors). The variable management/incentive fee is payable to the Advisor or its assignees in cash or shares, or a combination of both, the form of payment to be determined in the sole discretion of the Advisor and the value of any share to be determined by the Advisor acting in good faith on the basis of such quotations and other information as it considers, in its reasonable judgment, appropriate. There was no fee similar to the variable management/incentive fee prior to February 17, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred no variable management/incentive fee to the Advisor. 
With respect to periods ending prior to April 1, 2015, pursuant to the then effective Advisory Agreement and the limited partnership agreement of the OP (as amended from time to time, the "LPA"), the Company caused the OP to issue (subject to periodic approval by the Board) to the Advisor an asset management subordinated participation in the form of Class B Units. During these periods, the OP issued 359,250 Class B Units to the Advisor, all of which remain outstanding, but no Class B Units have been or will be issued pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and the LPA in effect with respect to subsequent periods. The issued and outstanding Class B Units will vest, and will no longer be subject to forfeiture, at such time as: (x) the value of the OP's assets plus all distributions made equals or exceeds the total amount of capital contributed by investors plus a 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return thereon (the "economic hurdle"); (y) any one of the following occurs: (1) a listing; (2) another liquidity event or (3) the termination of the Advisory Agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's independent directors without cause; and (z) the Advisor is still providing advisory services to the Company (the "performance condition"). Unvested Class B Units will be forfeited immediately if: (a) the Advisory Agreement is terminated for any reason other than a termination without cause; or (b) the Advisory Agreement is terminated by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's independent directors without cause before the economic hurdle has been met. The Advisor receives distributions on any vested and unvested Class B Units equal to the distribution rate received on shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Advisor received $340 thousand in distributions with respect to the Class B Units.
Acquisition Expenses 
Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is entitled to reimbursement for services provided for which it incurs investment-related expenses, or insourced expenses. The amount reimbursed for insourced expenses cannot exceed 0.5% of the contract purchase price of each acquired property or 0.5% of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment. Additionally, the Company reimburses the Advisor for third party acquisition expenses. 
In no event will the total of acquisition expenses exceed 4.5% of the contract purchase price of the Company's portfolio or 4.5% of the amount advanced for all loans or other investments, and this threshold has not been exceeded through December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Advisor and its affiliates incurred on our behalf  $176 thousand in acquisition expenses, of which $32 thousand had not been reimbursed by us as of December 31, 2018.
Professional Fees and Other Reimbursements 
The Company reimburses the Advisor's costs of providing administrative services and certain personnel costs. For additional information, see "Compensation and Other Information Concerning Officers, Directors and Certain Stockholders — Compensation of Executive Officers." This reimbursement includes reasonable overhead expenses for employees of the Advisor or its affiliates directly involved in the performance of services on behalf of the Company, including the reimbursement of rent expense at certain properties that are both occupied by employees of the Advisor or its affiliates and owned by affiliates of the Advisor. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Advisor and its affiliates incurred on our behalf $8.9 million in administrative services and personnel costs, of which $674 thousand had not been reimbursed by us as of December 31, 2018. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The Company's revolving credit facility that was effective during 2018 required it to meet certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis. During the first quarter of 2018, the Advisor elected to, without any interest accrual, defer cash payment of  $1.7 million in certain fees and reimbursements due to the Advisor as of December 31, 2017. The Advisor's deferral enabled the Company to comply with such covenants as of December 31, 2017. These deferred fees and reimbursements were due to the Advisor upon demand no later than June 30, 2018 and were repaid during April 2018.
Termination Payments 
Under the Advisory Agreement, upon the termination or non-renewal thereof, the Advisor will be entitled to receive from the Company all amounts due to the Advisor, including any change in control fee and transition fee, as well as the then-present fair market value of the Advisor's interest in the Company. All fees will be due within 30 days after the effective date of the termination. 
The Advisory Agreement provides for payment of a fee to the Advisor upon termination by either party in connection with a Change of Control. The Change of Control fee would be equal to the product of four multiplied by the Subject Fees. 
The Advisory Agreement provides for payment of a fee to the Advisor upon termination by the Company in connection with a transition to self-management. The transition fee would be equal to (a) $15.0 million plus (b) the product of four multiplied by the Subject Fees, but may not more than an amount equal to 4.5 multiplied by the Subject Fees. 
The "Subject Fees" are equal to the sum of  (i) four multiplied by the actual base management fee plus (ii) four multiplied by the actual variable management/incentive fee, in each of clauses (i) and (ii), payable for the fiscal quarter immediately prior to the fiscal quarter in which the Change of Control or transition to self-management, as applicable, is consummated, plus, (iii) without duplication, the annual increase in the base management fee resulting from the cumulative net proceeds of any equity raised (but excluding proceeds from the Company's distribution reinvestment plan) in respect of the fiscal quarter immediately prior to the fiscal quarter in which the Change of Control or transition to self-management, as applicable, is consummated.
Special Allocation 
The LPA provides for a special allocation, solely for tax purposes, of excess depreciation deductions of up to $10.0 million to the Advisor, a limited partner of the OP. In connection with this special allocation, the Advisor has agreed to restore a deficit balance in its capital account in the event of a liquidation of the OP and has agreed to provide a guaranty or indemnity of indebtedness of the OP. 
Special Limited Partner 
As of December 31, 2018, Healthcare Trust Special Limited Partner, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner"), an affiliate of the Advisor, owned 8,888 shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and holds the special limited partnership in the OP which entitles it to certain distributions (and any corresponding allocations) under the LPA. 
If our Common Stock is listed on a national exchange, the Special Limited Partner will be entitled to receive a promissory note as evidence of its right to receive subordinated incentive listing distribution from the OP equal to 15.0% of the amount by which the market value of all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock plus distributions exceeds the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to a 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return to investors. The Special Limited Partner will not be entitled to the subordinated incentive listing distribution unless investors have received a 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on their capital contributions. The Special Limited Partner is also entitled to receive a subordinated participation in the net sales proceeds of the sale of real estate assets from the OP equal to 15.0% of remaining net sale proceeds after return of capital contributions to investors plus payment to investors of a 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on the capital contributed by investors. The Special Limited Partner is not entitled to the subordinated participation in net sale proceeds unless the Company's investors have received their capital contributions plus a 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on their capital  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
contributions. Neither of these distributions has been earned through the date of this Proxy Statement. The Special Limited Partner and its affiliates can earn only the subordinated incentive listing distribution, or the subordinated participation in net sales proceeds or the subordinated incentive termination distribution described below. 
In addition, pursuant to the LPA, upon termination or non-renewal of the Advisory Agreement, with or without cause, the Special Limited Partner is entitled to receive a promissory note as evidence of its right to receive subordinated termination distributions from the OP equal to 15.0% of the amount by which the sum of the Company's market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual 6.0% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return to investors. The Special Limited Partner is able to elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either a listing on a national securities exchange or other liquidity event occurs. The Special Limited Partner and its affiliates can earn only the subordinated incentive termination distribution, or the subordinated participation in net sales proceeds or the subordinated incentive listing distribution described above. 
Property Manager 
Pursuant to a property management agreement with the Property Manager (as amended, the "Property Management Agreement"), unless the Company contracts with a third party, the Company pays the Property Manager a property management fee of 1.5% of gross revenues from the Company's stand-alone single-tenant net leased properties and 2.5% of gross revenues from all other types of properties, respectively. The Company also reimburses the Property Manager for property level expenses. If the Company contracts directly with third parties for such services, the Company will pay the third party customary market fees and will pay the Property Manager an oversight fee of up to 1.0% of the gross revenues of the property managed. In no event will the Company pay the Property Manager or any affiliate of the Property Manager both a property management fee and an oversight fee with respect to any particular property. 
The current term of the Property Management Agreement ends on February 17, 2020 and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless any party provides written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the term. The Property Management Agreement may assign the agreement to any party with expertise in commercial real estate which has, together with its affiliates, over $100.0 million in assets under management. 
On April 10, 2018, in connection with a multi-property CMBS loan, the Company and the OP entered into an amendment to the Property Management Agreement confirming, consistent with the intent of the parties, that the borrowers under the loan and other subsidiaries of the OP that actually own or lease the Company's properties are the direct obligors under the arrangements pursuant to which the Company's properties are actually managed by either the Property Manager or a third party overseen by the Property Manager pursuant to the Property Management Agreement. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $3.6 million in property management fees to the Property Manager, of which $58,000 remained unpaid as of December 31, 2018. 
Asset Purchase 
On June 16, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to purchase 19 properties from HT III, comprising substantially all of HT III's assets (the "Asset Purchase"). On December 22, 2017, the Asset Purchase closed. Concurrently, the Company borrowed approximately $45.0 million under its revolving credit facility and added 15 properties, including 14 of the 19 properties purchased in the Asset Purchase, to the pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets comprising the borrowing base under its revolving credit facility. This advance was used to fund a portion of the amount required to complete the Asset Purchase. 
At the closing of the Asset Purchase, the Company paid HT III $108.4 million, representing the purchase price under the Purchase Agreement of  $120.0 million, less (i) $0.7 million reflecting prorations and closing adjustments in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, (ii) $4.9 million reflecting the outstanding principal amount of the loan secured by HT III's Philip Center property assumed by the  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
Company at the closing in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) $6.0 million deposited by the Company into an escrow account in accordance with the Purchase Agreement (the "Escrow Amount"). The Purchase Agreement contained a number of customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type made by the Company, on the one hand, and HT III, on the other hand, which generally survived, along with related indemnification obligations, for a period of 14 months following the closing, until February 22, 2019. The Escrow Amount was released in full to HT III in three installments over a period of 14 months following the closing, less any amounts paid or reserved for pending or unsatisfied indemnification claims that the Company may make pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. No indemnification claims were made under the Purchase Agreement and the full Escrow Amount was in accordance with the terms, with the final installment paid shortly prior to the liquidation and dissolution of HT III in March 2019. The Company had a $0.2 million net receivable from HT III included on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 related to prorations under the Purchase Agreement, which was paid by HT III prior to its liquidation. 
Investment Allocation Agreement 
The Company had entered into an investment opportunity allocation agreement (the "Allocation Agreement") with HT III, pursuant to which, if either the Advisor or HT III's advisor determined that one or more proposed healthcare property acquisitions was appropriate for either the Company or HT III, and assuming each has sufficient capital to support such proposed healthcare property acquisition, such proposed healthcare property acquisition was to be presented to the Board of Directors and HT III's board of directors for a vote on whether to pursue such proposed healthcare property acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2018 and until the Allocation Agreement terminated automatically in accordance with its terms upon the dissolution of HT III on March 8, 2019, HT III did not make any acquisitions. 
Indemnification Obligations 
Subject to conditions and exceptions, the Company has agreed pursuant to the Advisory Agreement to indemnify the Advisor and its affiliates, as well as their respective officers, directors, equity holders, members, partners, stockholders, other equity holders and employees, from and against all losses, claims, damages, losses, joint or several, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts arising in the performance of their duties under the Advisory Agreement. Subject to conditions and exceptions, the Company has also agreed to advance any indemnitee legal expenses and other costs incurred as a result of any legal action for which the indemnification being sought is permissible. 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with the Advisor and certain of its affiliates, each of our directors and officers, and certain former directors and officers, providing that we will indemnify them to the extent permitted by Maryland law and our charter and advance expenses to them in connection with claims or liability they may become subject to due to their service to us consistent with the provisions of our charter and Maryland law. 
We have not paid  the Advisor or any of its affiliates for any amounts pursuant to these obligations through the date of this Proxy Statement. 
Affiliated Transaction Best Practices Policy 
Pursuant to AR Global's affiliated transaction best practices policy, which was approved by our Board, we may not enter into any co-investments or any other business transaction with, or provide funding or make loans to, directly or indirectly, any investment program or other entity sponsored by the AR Global group of companies or otherwise controlled or sponsored, or in which ownership (other than certain minority interests) is held, directly or indirectly, by any of the individuals who share control of the AR Global group of companies, that is a non-traded REIT or private investment vehicle in which ownership interests are offered through securities broker-dealers in a public or private offering, except that we may enter into a joint investment with a Delaware statutory trust (a "DST") or a group of unaffiliated tenant in common owners ("TICs") in connection with a private retail securities offering by a DST or to TICs, provided that such investments are in the form of pari passu equity investments, are fully and promptly disclosed to our stockholders and will be fully documented among the parties with all the rights, duties and  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
obligations assumed by the parties as are normally attendant to such an equity investment, and that we retain a controlling interest in the underlying investment, the transaction is approved by the independent directors of the Board after due and documented deliberation, including deliberation of any conflicts of interest, and such co-investment is deemed fair, both financially and otherwise. In the case of such co-investment, the Advisor will be permitted to charge fees at no more than the rate corresponding to our percentage co-investment and in line with the fees ordinarily attendant to such transaction. At any one time, our investment in such co-investments will not exceed 10% of the value of our portfolio. 
Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures 
Every transaction that we enter into with our Advisor or its affiliates is subject to an inherent conflict of interest. Our Board of Directors may encounter conflicts of interest in enforcing our rights against any affiliate in the event of a default by or disagreement with an affiliate or in invoking powers, rights or options pursuant to any agreement between us and our Advisor or any of its affiliates. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews and evaluates transactions and conflict of interest situations involving our Advisor, AR Global, our directors, our officers and any of their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. The nominating and corporate governance committee has determined that all our transactions with our Advisor, AR Global and their respective affiliates during the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on the date of this Proxy Statement were fair to, and in the best interest of, us. All these related party transactions were approved in accordance with the applicable Company policies consistent with the charter of the nominating and corporate governance committee, and there were no other related party transactions during that period. See "Board of Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee." 
In addition, the Advisory Agreement limits our ability to enter into transactions with the Advisor and its affiliates as follows: 
 If we propose to enter into any transaction in which the Advisor, any affiliate of the Advisor or any of the Advisor's directors or officers has a direct or indirect interest, then the transaction must be approved by a majority of our directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, including a majority of our independent directors. 
​
 We may not make loans to the Advisor or any of its affiliates except mortgages or loans to wholly owned subsidiaries of ours. The Advisor and its affiliates may not make loans to us, or to any joint venture or partnership or other similar arrangements in which we are a co-venturer, limited liability company member, limited partner or general partner, which are established to acquire or hold our investments ("Joint Ventures"), unless approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in such transaction as fair, competitive, and commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 
​
 We may enter into Joint Ventures with the Advisor or its affiliates provided that (a) a majority of our directors (including a majority of our independent directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us, and (b) the investment by us is on substantially the same terms as those received by other joint venturers.

Audit Committee Leslie D. Michelson (Chair) Lee M. Elman Gov. Edward G. Rendell Elizabeth K. Tuppeny  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
PROPOSAL NO. 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of five members, of which four are independent directors. Our bylaws provide that the number of directors may not be less than one, which is the minimum number required by the MGCL, nor more than 15. The Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. At the Annual Meeting, two Class II directors will be elected to serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Each director serves for a term of three years, until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. The number of directors in each class may be changed from time to time by the Board to reflect matters such as an increase or decrease in the number of directors so that each class, to the extent possible, will have the same number of directors. 
The Board of Directors has nominated Edward G. Rendell and Elizabeth K. Tuppeny for election as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting, to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Gov. Rendell and Ms. Tuppeny currently serve as Class II directors of the Company. 
The proxy holder named on the proxy card intends to vote "FOR" the election of Gov. Rendell and Ms. Tuppeny as the Class II directors. The election of the Class II directors requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, provided that a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any are applicable, will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
We know of no reason why Gov. Rendell or Ms. Tuppeny will be unable to serve if elected. If, at the time of the Annual Meeting, Gov. Rendell or Ms. Tuppeny should become unable to serve, shares represented by proxies will be voted "FOR" any substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors. No proxy will be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees described in this Proxy Statement. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EDWARD G. RENDELL AND ELIZABETH K. TUPPENY AS CLASS II DIRECTORS, TO SERVE UNTIL THE COMPANY'S 2022 ANNUAL MEETING AND UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE DULY ELECTED AND QUALIFY. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
PROPOSAL NO. 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The audit committee of the Board of Directors has selected and appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Although ratification by stockholders is not required by law or by our charter or bylaws, our audit committee believes that submission of its selection to stockholders is a matter of good corporate governance. PwC reports directly to our audit committee. Even if the appointment is ratified, our audit committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if our audit committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. If our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, our audit committee will take that fact into consideration, together with such other factors it deems relevant, in determining its next selection of an independent registered public accounting firm. 
A representative of PwC will attend the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
KPMG LLP ("KPMG") audited our consolidated financial statements every year since the year ended December 31, 2014 through the year ended December 31, 2018. No representative of KPMG is expected to attend the Annual Meeting.
On March 14, 2019, our audit committee dismissed KPMG and approved the engagement of PwC as its new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
KPMG's audit reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
During our two most recent fiscal years and the period from January 1, 2019 through March 14, 2019: (i) there were no disagreements between us and KPMG on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on our consolidated financial statements; and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
Prior to engaging PwC, during our two most recent fiscal years and the period from January 1, 2019 through March 14, 2019, neither we nor anyone acting on our behalf had consulted PwC regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, nor did PwC provide a written report or oral advice to us that PwC concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a "disagreement" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
Fees 
No fees for review and audit services rendered by PwC were incurred during the year December 31, 2018 because we did not engage PwC for these services until March 2019. PwC had previously provided certain tax services as described below under "— Tax Fees."
Audit Fees 
There were no audit fees billed by PwC for the year ended December 31, 2018. Audit fees billed by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were $880,250 and $935,530, respectively. 
Audit Related Fees 
There were no audit related fees billed by PwC for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no audit related fees billed by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Tax Fees 
Tax compliance and transfer pricing fees billed by PwC for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $387,000 and $446,000. There were no tax fees billed by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018. 
All Other Fees 
There were no other fees billed by PwC for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were no other fees billed by KPMG for the years ended December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2018. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
In considering the nature of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, our audit committee determined that such services are compatible with the provision of independent audit services. Our audit committee discussed these services with the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company's management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the related requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. All services rendered by PwC following its engagement as our independent registered public accounting firm or KPMG were pre-approved by the audit committee.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PwC AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Common Stock of the Company to file initial reports of ownership of such securities and reports of changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC. Such officers, directors and 10% stockholders of the Company are also required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during the year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were timely satisfied. 
In making these statements, we have relied upon examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments to these forms, provided to us and the written representations of our directors, executive officers, and ten percent stockholders.
CODE OF ETHICS 
The Board of Directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics effective as of March 7, 2013 (the "Code of Ethics"), which is applicable to the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates.
