PROXY STATEMENT
Notice of Internet Availability mailed on or about December 21, 2018
General Information
The proxy that accompanies this statement is solicited by the Board of Directors of SIFCO Industries, Inc. (the "Company" or "SIFCO") for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company to be held January 31, 2019, or at any adjournment thereof. 
As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Material (the "Notice") to all shareholders.  All shareholders will have the ability to access this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 as filed with the SEC on December 6, 2018 on a website referred to in the Notice or to request a printed set of these materials at no charge.  Instructions on how to access these materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. 
In addition, any shareholder may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis.  The cost of solicitation of proxies in the form accompanying this statement will be borne by the Company.  Choosing to receive future proxy materials by email will save the Company the cost of printing and mailing documents to shareholders and will reduce the impact of annual meetings on the environment.  A shareholder's election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until the shareholder terminates it.
Any shareholder giving a proxy for the meeting may revoke it before it is exercised by giving a later dated proxy or by giving notice of revocation to the Company in writing before or at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  However, the mere presence at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the shareholder granting a proxy will not revoke the proxy. Unless revoked by notice as above stated, shares represented by valid proxies will be voted on all matters to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  On any matter or matters with respect to which the proxy contains instructions for voting, such shares will be voted in accordance with such instructions. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be deemed to be present for the purpose of determining a quorum for the 2019 Annual Meeting. Abstentions will not affect the vote on Proposal No. 1, but will be counted as "votes against" with respect to proposal No. 2.  Brokers who have not received voting instructions from beneficial owners generally may vote in their discretion with respect to the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm, but will not be able to vote with respect to Proposal No. 1.  Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any proposals brought before the 2019 Annual Meeting.

PROPOSAL 1 - TO ELECT SEVEN (7) DIRECTORS
Seven (7) directors are to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and/or until their respective successors are elected and qualified. Shares represented by validly given proxies will be voted in favor of the following persons to serve as directors unless the shareholder indicates to the contrary on the proxy. The seven (7) nominees receiving the most votes will be elected as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of nominees than the number named in this Proxy Statement.
Each of the below nominees has consented (i) to serve as a nominee, (ii) to being named as a nominee in this Proxy Statement and (iii) to serve as a director, if elected. Although the Company does not contemplate that any  of the nominees will be unavailable for election, if a vacancy in the slate of nominees is occasioned by death or other unexpected occurrence, it is currently intended that the remaining directors will, by the vote of a majority of their number, designate a different nominee for election to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Board Recommendation - The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of all nominees. Unless you instruct otherwise on your proxy card or in person, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. 
Nominees for election to the Board of Directors
Set forth below for each nominee for election as a director is a brief statement, including the age, principal occupation and business experience, and any directorships held. The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee have recommended the persons listed below as nominees for the Board of Directors, all of whom presently are directors of the Company. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews and evaluates individuals for nomination to stand for election as a director, who are recommended to the Nominating and Governance Committee in writing by any of our shareholders pursuant to the procedure outlined below in the section titled "Process for Selecting and Nominating Directors" on the same basis as candidates who are suggested by our current or past directors, executive officers, or other sources. In considering individuals for nomination to stand for election, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider: (i) the current composition of directors and how they function as a group; (ii) the skills, experiences or background, and the personalities, strengths, and weaknesses of current directors; (iii) the value of contributions made by individual directors; (iv) the need for a person with specific skills, experiences or background to be added to the Board; (v) any anticipated vacancies due to retirement or other reasons; and (vi) other factors that may enter into the nomination decision. The Nominating and Governance Committee endeavors to select nominees that contribute requisite skills and professional experiences in order to advance the performance of the Board of Directors and establish a well rounded Board with diverse views that reflect the interests of our shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for directors, however, there is no formal policy in this regard. The Nominating and Governance Committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint, in addition to traditional concepts of diversity, such as race and gender.
When considering an individual candidate's suitability for the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee does not prescribe minimum qualifications or standards for directors, however, the Nominating and Governance Committee looks for directors who have personal characteristics, educational backgrounds and relevant experience that would be expected to help further the goals of both the Board and the Company. The Nominating and Governance Committee will review the extent of the candidate's demonstrated success in his or her chosen business, profession, or other career and the skills that the candidate would be expected to add to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee may, in certain cases, conduct interviews with the candidate and/or contact references, business associates, other members of boards on which the candidate serves or other appropriate persons to obtain additional information. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make its determinations on whether to nominate an individual candidate based on the Board's then-current needs, the merits of that candidate and the qualifications of other available candidates. The types of key attributes and/or experience that the Nominating and Governance Committee believes the composite board membership needs to possess to ensure the existence of a functionally effective board are: (i) proven leadership capabilities; (ii) familiarity with the organizational and operational requirements of medium and large-sized manufacturing organizations; (iii) strategic planning; (iv) experience in mergers and acquisitions and an understanding of financial markets; (v) experience in finance and  accounting; (vi) familiarity with the aerospace, defense, energy and related industries and markets; (vii) experience with public company compensation matters and structure; and (viii) prior service on the boards of directors of other companies â€“ both public and private. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that each of the nominees possesses certain of the key attributes that such Committee believes to be important for an effective board.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent (10%) shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished to the Company during, or with respect to, the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company believes that no director, officer, beneficial owner of more than ten percent (10%) of its outstanding Common Shares or any other person subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act failed to file on a timely basis during fiscal 2018 any reports required by 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS MATTERS
Board of Directors - The Company's Board of Directors held seven (7) scheduled meetings during fiscal 2018. The Board of Directors' standing committees are the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees. From time-to-time, the Board may determine that it is appropriate to form a special committee of its independent directors to address a particular matter(s) not specific to one of its standing committees. Directors are expected to attend Board meetings, the annual shareholders' meeting, and meetings of the committees on which he or she serves. During fiscal 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served. SIFCO's independent directors meet in executive session at each  regularly scheduled Board meeting. All the directors attended (in person or telephonically) the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Director Independence - The members of the Board of Directors' standing committees are all independent directors as defined in Section 803 of the NYSE American Company Guide. The Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Gotschall, Mr. Molten, Jr., Ms. Reitman, Mr. Wells, Jr. and Mr. Silk meet these standards of independence. There are no undisclosed transactions, relationships, or arrangements between the Company and any of such directors. The Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Knapper, current employee of the Company and Mr. Smith, due to his relationship as described in the Director Compensation section included herein, do not meet these standards of independence, are therefore not independent and, accordingly, are not members of any of the Board's standing committees. 
Board Committees
Audit Committee - The functions of the Audit Committee are to select, subject to shareholder ratification, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; to approve all non-audit related services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; to determine the scope of the audit; to discuss any special problems that may arise during the course of the audit; and to review the audit and its findings for the purpose of reporting to the Board of Directors. Further, the Audit Committee receives a written statement delineating the relationship between the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company. None of the members of the Audit Committee participated in the preparation of the Company's financial statements at any time during the past three (3) years. The members of the Audit Committee are all independent directors as defined in Section 803 of the NYSE American Company Guide and SEC Rule 10A-3. Each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and Ms. Reitman is designated as the Audit Committee financial expert. None of the Audit Committee members serve on more than one (1) other public company audit committee. The Audit Committee, currently composed of Ms.  Reitman (Chairperson), Mr. Molten, Jr., Mr. Wells, Jr., and Mr. Silk held four (4) meetings during fiscal 2018.  The Audit Committee operates under a written charter that is available on the Company's website at www.sifco.com.
Compensation Committee - The functions of the Compensation Committee are to review and make recommendations to the Board to ensure that our executive compensation and benefit programs are consistent with our compensation philosophy and corporate governance guidelines and, subject to the approval of the Board, to establish the executive compensation packages offered to directors and officers. Officers' base salary, target annual incentive compensation awards and granting of long-term equity-based incentive compensation, and the number of shares that should be subject to each equity instrument so granted, are set at competitive levels with the opportunity to earn competitive pay for targeted performance as measured against the performance of a peer group of companies. The Compensation Committee is appointed by the Board, and consists entirely of directors who are independent directors as defined in Section 803 of the NYSE American Company Guide. Our Compensation Committee, currently composed of Mr. Wells, Jr. (Chairperson), Mr. Molten, Jr., Ms. Reitman, and Mr. Silk held four (4) meetings during fiscal 2018 and conducted other committee discussions as a part of a regular board meeting, some of which discussions were conducted without the CEO present.  The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter that is available on the Company's website at www.sifco.com.
Nominating and Governance Committee - The functions of the Nominating and Governance Committee are to recommend candidates for the Board of Directors and address issues relating to (i) senior management performance and Board succession and (ii) the composition and procedures of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee is currently composed of Mr. Molten, Jr. (Chairperson), Ms. Reitman, Mr. Silk and Mr. Wells, Jr.  The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are all independent directors as defined in Section 803 of  the NYSE American Company Guide. The Nominating and Governance Committee held four (4) meetings during fiscal 2018. Other functions of the Nominating and Governance Committee were fulfilled during sessions of the full Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written charter that is available on the Company's website at www.sifco.com. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight - The Board reviews the Company's annual plan and strategic plan, which address, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing the Company. The Board also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning, and discusses and reviews succession planning on a regular basis. Certain areas of oversight may be delegated to the relevant committees of the Board and the committees report back on their deliberations. This oversight is enabled by reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of enterprise-wide risks. Management incorporates enterprise-wide risk assessment of the Company as part of its annual planning process, including each of its business segments, and presents it to the Board for review as part of senior management's annual planning process. The Board monitors enterprise-wide risk management with management periodically throughout the year.  The principal areas of this risk assessment include a review of strategic business, financial, operational, compliance and technology objectives and the potential risk for the Company. In addition, on an ongoing basis: (a) the Audit Committee maintains primary responsibility for oversight of risks and exposures pertaining to the accounting, auditing and financial reporting processes of the Company; (b) the Compensation Committee maintains primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with oversight of the administration and implementation of our compensation policies; and (c) the Nominating and Governance Committee maintains primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with corporate governance and succession planning. 
Separation of Role of Chairman of the Board and CEO - Mr. Wells serves as Chairman of the Board, a position he has held since July 1, 2016.  The Company has determined its current structure to be most effective as the Chairman serves as a liaison between its directors and management and helps to maintain communication and discussion among the Board and management.  The Chairman serves in a presiding capacity at meetings and has such other duties as are determined by the Board from time to time.
Process for Selecting and Nominating Directors - In its role as the nominating body for the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the credentials of potential director candidates (including any potential candidates recommended by shareholders), conducts interviews and makes formal recommendations to the Board for the annual and any interim election of directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider shareholder nominations for directors at any time. Any shareholder desiring to have a nominee considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee should submit such recommendation in writing to a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee or the Corporate Secretary of the Company, c/o SIFCO Industries, Inc., 970 East 64th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44103. The recommendation letter should include the shareholder's own name, address and the number of shares owned and the candidate's name, age, business address, residence address, and principal occupation, as well as the number of shares the candidate owns.

Code of Ethics â€“ The Company's Code of Ethics applies to all of its Directors and its employees, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. The Code of Ethics and all committee charters are posted in the Investor Relations portion of the Company's website at www.sifco.com. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions - There were no transactions between the Company and its officers, directors or any person related to its officers or directors, or with any holder of more than 5% of the Company's Common Shares, either during fiscal 2018 or up to the date of this proxy statement, except for the continued sales representative agreement in place between the Company and Mr. Smith that is discussed below under the heading "Director Compensation."
The Company reviews all transactions between the Company and any of its officers and directors. The Company's Code of Ethics emphasizes the importance of avoiding situations or transactions in which personal interests may interfere with the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. In addition, the Company's general corporate governance practice includes board-level discussion and assessment of procedures for discussing and assessing relationships, including business, financial, familial and nonprofit, among the Company and its officers and directors, to the extent that they may arise. The Board reviews any transaction with an officer or director to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a conflict of interest exists. The Board ensures that all directors voting on such a matter have no interest in the matter and discusses the transaction with legal counsel as the Board deems necessary. The Board will generally delegate the task of discussing, reviewing and approving transactions between the Company and any of its related persons to the Audit Committee.

 Pay Philosophy and Practices
  Role of Compensation Committee: 
Four independent directors comprise our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for establishing and administering our compensation policies, programs and procedures. In performing its duties, the Compensation Committee may request information from senior management regarding the Company's performance, pay and programs to assist it in its actions. Moreover, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain outside advisors as needed to assist it in reviewing the Company's programs, revising them and providing analysis regarding competitive pay information. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and establishes the goals used for our incentive plans. In addition, it annually assesses the performance of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer. Based on this evaluation, the Compensation Committee then recommends the Chief Executive Officer's compensation for the next year to the Board for its consideration and approval. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews the Chief Executive Officer's compensation recommendations for the remaining NEOs, providing appropriate input and approving final awards. Finally, the Compensation Committee provides approval for the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations of the compensation of other key executives.
 Role of Senior Management:
The Company's management serves in an advisory or support capacity as the Compensation Committee carries out its charter. Typically, the Company's Chief Executive Officer participates in meetings of the Compensation Committee, but does not participate in discussion regarding compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. The Company's other NEOs and senior management may participate as necessary or at the Compensation Committee's request. The NEOs and senior management normally provide the Compensation Committee with information regarding the Company's performance, as well as information regarding executives who participate in the Company's various plans. Such data is usually focused on the executives' historical pay and benefit levels, plan costs, context for how programs have changed over time and input regarding particular management issues that need to be addressed. In addition, management may furnish similar information to independent compensation advisors engaged from time to time by the Compensation Committee.  Management provides input regarding the recommendations made by outside advisors or the Compensation Committee. Management implements, communicates and administers the programs approved by the Compensation Committee. The Chief Executive Officer annually evaluates the performance of the Company and its other NEOs. Based on his evaluation, he provides the Compensation Committee with his recommendations regarding the pay for the other NEOs for its consideration, input and approval. The Compensation Committee, in turn, authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the pay for the Company's other executives based on terms consistent with those used to establish the pay of the NEOs. Members of management present at meetings when pay is discussed are recused from such discussions when the Compensation Committee focuses on their individual pay.
     Use of Market Pay Study:  
The Company's pay program has utilized compensation data from a market pay study conducted by Pay Governance ("Pay Governance"), an independent advisor previously engaged by the Compensation Committee. This study was originally commissioned by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2013 in order to achieve a comprehensive, independent review of the Company's executive compensation program. Compensation data for the CEO position was provided by Pay Governance at the end of fiscal 2015. The Pay Governance studies provided compensation information from a peer group of companies in technology-oriented metals manufacturing companies whose median revenues and assets are comparable to ours, as well as data from compensation surveys that included  hundreds of companies in a broader range of industries with revenues that are comparable to ours. We continued to reference this data from time-to-time when making pay decisions, applying a market-based aging factor as necessary to bring the 2013 data current.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
The Company has entered into a Change in Control and Severance Agreement with Mr. Knapper which provides severance benefits in the event of his involuntary termination with or without a change in control. The Company has entered into a Change in Control Agreement with Mr. Kubera which provides severance benefits in the event of his involuntary termination with a change in control.  The purpose of these agreements is to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of these executives to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of (i) solicitations by other employers and (ii) the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. These agreements provide the following benefits: 
â€¢ In the case of Mr. Knapper, if Mr. Knapper is terminated involuntarily without a change in control within the first three (3) years of his employment, or if Mr. Knapper is terminated other than for cause or if he terminates his employment for good reason within the two (2) year period following a change in control, the Change in Control and Severance Agreement provides for a lump sum severance payment equal to 200% of his annual base salary in effect at the time of termination, continuation of health and welfare insurance coverage for up to 24 months following termination, and pro-rata vesting of any outstanding awards under  the Company's 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  Mr. Knapper's Equity Award Agreements provide full vesting of outstanding awards if Mr. Knapper is terminated involuntarily following a Change in Control.
â€¢ In the case of Mr. Kubera, if, within the two year period following a change of control, Mr. Kubera is terminated other than for cause or if he terminates with good reason, the Change In Control Agreement provides for a lump sum severance payment equal to 100% of his annual base salary in effect at the time of termination and continuation of health and welfare insurance coverage for up to 12 months following termination. Mr. Kubera's Equity Award Agreements provide full vesting of outstanding awards if Mr. Kubera is terminated involuntarily following a Change in Control.

PROPOSAL 2 â€“ TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF AUDITORS
The firm of Grant Thornton LLP has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. The Board of Directors has chosen that firm to audit the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, subject to the ratification of the shareholders for which the affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Shares present and voting at the 2019 Annual Meeting (in person or by proxy) is required. Proposal No. 2 is a non-binding proposal.  Although shareholder ratification is not required under the laws of the State of Ohio, the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP is being submitted to the Company's shareholders for ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting in order to provide a means by which our shareholders may communicate their opinion to the Audit Committee. If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment, but is not obligated to change the appointment, and may for other reasons be unable to make another appointment. Grant Thornton LLP has advised the Company that neither the firm nor any of its members or associates has any direct or indirect financial interest in the Company or any of its affiliates other than as auditors.  
Board Recommendation - the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of Grant Thornton LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the year ending September 30, 2019. Unless you instruct otherwise on your proxy card or in person, your proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. 
Representatives of Grant Thornton LLP are expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
A shareholder who intends to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting, and who wishes to have the proposal included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting, must deliver the proposal to the Company no later than August 23, 2019. Any shareholder proposal submitted other than for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be delivered to the Company no later than October 30, 2019 or such proposal will be considered untimely. If a shareholder proposal is received after October 30, 2019, the Company may vote, in its discretion as to the proposal, all of the Common Shares for which it has received proxies for the 2020 Annual Meeting.   
OTHER MATTERS
The Company does not know of any other matters that will come before the meeting.  In case any other matter should properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy or their substitutions to vote in accordance with their best judgment in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such a recommendation, in accordance with their judgment pursuant to the discretionary authority conferred by the enclosed proxy.
NO INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  
The Audit Committee Report (including reference to the independence of the Audit Committee members) is not deemed filed with the SEC or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any prior or future filings made by us under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate such information by  reference. The section of this Proxy Statement entitled "Proposal to Elect Seven (7) Directors," "Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance," "Corporate Governance and Board of Director Matters," "Executive Compensation," "Director Compensation," and "Principal Accounting Fees and Services" are specifically incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
NOTICE REGARDING DELIVERY OF SECURITY HOLDER DOCUMENTS  
The SEC now permits companies to send a single set of annual disclosure documents to any household at which two (2) or more stockholders reside, unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the Company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures. In such cases, such stockholders continue to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. This "householding" process reduces the volume of duplicate information and reduces printing and mailing expenses. The Company has not instituted householding for shareholders of record; however, a number of brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of the Company's Common Shares held through such brokerage firms. If your family has multiple accounts holding shares of Common Shares of the Company, you already may have received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of the annual disclosure documents. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this Proxy Statement or our Annual Report promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY 
Disclosure regarding the executive officers of the Company is set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 filed with the SEC under the heading "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance", which is incorporated into this Proxy Statement by reference. This Annual Report will be delivered to our shareholders with the Proxy Statement. Copies of the Company's filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report, are available to any shareholder through the SEC's internet website at http://www.sec.gov or in person at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549.

Shareholders may also access our SEC filings free of charge on the Company's own internet website at http://www.sifco.com/proxy_materials.
