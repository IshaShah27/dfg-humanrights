PROXY STATEMENT
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
SOLICITATION
The solicitation of your proxy is made on behalf of the Board of Directors of Ally Financial Inc. (Board) for use at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 7, 2019, and any adjournment of the meeting (Annual Meeting). References in this proxy statement to we, us, our, the Company, and Ally refer to Ally Financial Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.
This proxy statement and the related form of proxy will first be sent or given on or about March 22, 2019, to the stockholders of record of our common stock at the close of business on March 12, 2019 (record date). This proxy statement and our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018, also will first be made available on our website at www.ally.com/about/investor/sec-filings/, free of charge, at or about the same time.
The complete mailing address of the Company's principal executive office is 500 Woodward Avenue, MC: MI-01-10-CORPSEC, Detroit, Michigan 48226. The Annual Meeting will be held at the Waterview Loft, 130 E. Atwater Street, Detroit, Michigan 48226.
ELECTRONIC AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting To Be Held on May 7, 2019. This proxy statement, our annual report to stockholders for fiscal year 2018, and our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 are available electronically at www.proxyvote.com/ally.
VOTING RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES
Stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date may vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, 401,064,755 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding and, therefore, eligible to be voted at the Annual Meeting. Only one class of our common stock exists, and each share is entitled to one vote.
Stockholders of record or record holders have shares of our common stock registered in their names with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company. Beneficial owners, in contrast, own shares of our common stock that are held in "street name" through a broker, bank, or other nominee. Beneficial owners generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct their brokers, banks, or other nominees how to vote the shares. If you are a beneficial owner of our common stock, your proxy is being solicited through your broker, bank, or other nominee.
You may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN on each of the three proposals. The Board recommends that you vote as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1 - FOR the election of each of the 12 nominees to our Board. 
• Proposal 2 - FOR the advisory resolution approving the compensation paid to our named executive officers. 
• Proposal 3 - FOR the ratification of the Audit Committee's engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
[END TABLE]
When this proxy statement was printed, we did not know of any matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than these three proposals. If any other matter may be properly considered at the Annual Meeting, your proxy can exercise discretion in voting your shares on the matter. We currently do not anticipate that any other matter will be presented at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   -1-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
We expect that the election of directors in Proposal 1 will be uncontested—that is, an election where the number of properly nominated director candidates does not exceed the number of directors to be elected. In that case, each director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. This means that the number of votes cast FOR a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST that director nominee. In an uncontested election of directors, our director resignation policy will apply as described further in Proposal 1. Voting ABSTAIN on Proposal 1 in an uncontested election will have no effect on the outcome.
If the election of directors in Proposal 1 unexpectedly becomes contested—that is, an election where the number of properly nominated director candidates exceeds the number of directors to be elected—plurality voting will apply. This means that the seats on the Board will be filled by the director nominees who receive the highest number of FOR votes. Voting AGAINST or ABSTAIN in a contested election will have no effect on the outcome.
For each of Proposals 2 and 3, a FOR vote from a majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval. Voting ABSTAIN on Proposals 2 or 3 will have the same effect as voting AGAINST.
We strongly encourage all stockholders to submit their votes in advance of the Annual Meeting, even if you are planning to attend in person.
If you are a record holder, you may vote your shares (1) through the internet, (2) by telephone, (3) by completing, signing, dating, and returning your proxy card in the provided envelope, or (4) in person by ballot at the Annual Meeting. Other proxy materials that you receive together with this proxy statement contain the website address and the telephone number for internet or telephone voting. Internet or telephone votes must be received by 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 6, 2019, in order to be counted. Completed, signed, and dated proxy cards must be received prior to the Annual Meeting in order to be counted. If you as a record holder submit a valid proxy prior to the Annual Meeting but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted according to the recommendations of the Board described earlier in this section.
If you are a beneficial owner, you may not vote your shares directly but instead may instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee how to vote your shares. You should receive materials from your broker, bank, or other nominee with directions on how to provide voting instructions. Those materials also will identify the time by which your broker, bank, or other nominee must receive your voting instructions. The availability of internet or telephone voting will depend on the processes adopted by your broker, bank, or other nominee. If you want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a legally enforceable proxy from your broker, bank, or other nominee in advance and present that proxy to the inspectors of election together with a valid form of government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport). For Proposals 1 and 2, if you are a beneficial owner of shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee is not permitted to vote your shares if no instruction is received from you. For Proposal 3, your broker, bank, or other nominee can exercise discretion in voting your shares if no instruction is received from you.
You may revoke or change your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. If you are a record holder, you may revoke or change your proxy by (1) executing and delivering a later-dated proxy for the same shares in compliance with the requirements described in this proxy statement, (2) voting the same shares again over the internet or telephone by 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 6, 2019, (3) voting a ballot at the Annual Meeting, or (4) notifying the Secretary of your revocation of the proxy prior to the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner, you must follow the directions provided to you by your broker, bank, or other nominee. Any beneficial owner of shares who wants to revoke a proxy at the Annual Meeting will need to present to the inspectors of election a legally enforceable proxy from the broker, bank, or other nominee indicating that the person is the beneficial owner of the shares together with a valid form of government-issued photo identification (such as a driver's license or passport).
[BEGIN TABLE]
   -2-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
We will pay the costs of preparing the proxy materials and soliciting proxies, including the reasonable charges and expenses of brokers, banks, and other nominees for forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners and updating proxy cards and directions. In addition to our solicitation of proxies, your proxy may be solicited by telephone, facsimile, internet, or e-mail or in person by directors, officers, or regular employees of Ally or its affiliates who will receive no additional compensation for doing so.
MEETING ADMISSION
Attendance at the Annual Meeting will be limited to stockholders of record or their proxies, beneficial owners of our common stock, and our guests. Record holders and beneficial owners must request an admission ticket in advance by visiting www.proxyvote.com/ally and following the instructions provided, which will require the 16-digit number included on your proxy card or voting instructions. Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order in which they are received and must be requested no later than May 3, 2019. On the day of the meeting, each stockholder, beneficial owner, or guest may be required to present a valid form of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to gain admittance.
CAUTIONARY NOTICE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND OTHER TERMS
This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts—such as our statements about targets and expectations for various financial and operating metrics. Forward-looking statements often use words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "pursue," "seek," "continue," "estimate," "project," "outlook," "forecast," "potential," "target," "objective," "trend," "plan," "goal," "initiative," "priorities," or other words of comparable meaning or future-tense or conditional verbs such as "may," "will," "should," "would," or "could." Forward-looking statements convey our expectations, intentions, or forecasts about future events, circumstances, or results. All forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which may change over time and many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on any forward-looking statement as a prediction or guarantee about the future. Actual future objectives, strategies, plans, prospects, performance, conditions, or results may differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statement. Some of the factors that may cause actual results or other future events or circumstances to differ from those in forward-looking statements are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, or other applicable documents that are filed or furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively, our SEC filings). Any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf speaks only as of the date that it was made. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of events, circumstances, or results that arise after the date that the statement was made, except as required by applicable securities laws. You, however, should consult further disclosures (including disclosures of a forward-looking nature) that we may make in any subsequent SEC filings. Unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply. The term "loans" means the following consumer and commercial products associated with our direct and indirect financing activities: loans, retail installment sales contracts, lines of credit, and other financing products excluding operating leases. The term "operating leases" means consumer- and commercial-vehicle lease agreements where Ally is the lessor and the lessee is generally not obligated to acquire ownership of the vehicle at lease-end or compensate Ally for the vehicle's residual value. The terms "lend," "finance," and "originate" mean our direct extension or origination of loans, our purchase or acquisition of loans, or our purchase of operating leases as applicable. The term "consumer" means all consumer products associated with our loan and operating-lease activities and all commercial retail installment sales contracts. The term "commercial" means all commercial products associated with our loan activities, other than commercial retail installment sales contracts.

PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board currently has 12 seats. The Board believes that this size is appropriate at the present time based on its assessment of the need for particular talents or other qualities, the benefits associated with a diversity of perspectives and backgrounds, the availability of qualified candidates, the workloads and needs of the Board's committees, and other relevant factors. All seats on the Board are up for election annually.
The Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee (CNGC) has recommended, and the Board has nominated, the following slate of 12 director candidates for election at the Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders in 2020. This slate comprises all of the current directors of the Company. Each has agreed to be nominated and named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected.

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
We expect that this will be an uncontested election of directors—that is, an election where the number of properly nominated director candidates does not exceed the number of directors to be elected. In that case, under our Bylaws, each director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the director. A "majority of the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted FOR a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted AGAINST that director nominee. Voting ABSTAIN in an uncontested election will have no effect on the outcome. The Company has adopted a director resignation policy providing that, if an incumbent director nominee fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, the director must promptly tender a notice of resignation to the Company's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Secretary, which will become effective only upon acceptance by the Board. The CEO or the Secretary, as applicable, will relay a copy of the notice to the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the CNGC. The CNGC will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the resignation should be accepted or rejected or whether other action should be taken. The affected director will not take part in any deliberations or actions of the CNGC or the Board relating to the resignation. Within 90 days following certification of the election results, the Board will act on the resignation, taking into account the CNGC's recommendation and any other information judged by the Board to be relevant, and publicly disclose its decision in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If the Board rejects the director's resignation, under Delaware law, the director will continue to serve on the Board. If the Board accepts the director's resignation, the Board may fill the resulting vacancy or may reduce the size of the Board.
If the election of directors unexpectedly becomes contested—that is, an election where the number of properly nominated director candidates exceeds the number of directors to be elected—plurality voting will apply under our Bylaws. "Plurality voting" means that the seats on the Board will be filled by the director nominees who receive the highest number of FOR votes. Voting AGAINST or ABSTAIN in a contested election will have no effect on the outcome.
No cumulative voting rights exist in this election. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, your broker, bank, or other nominee is not permitted to vote your shares on this matter if no instruction is received from you.
We do not anticipate that any nominee will become unavailable for election. If that were to happen for any reason, however, the shares represented by proxies and voting for a nominee who unexpectedly becomes unavailable will be voted instead for a substitute candidate nominated by the Board, unless the Board elects to reduce its size.
The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the election of each of the 12 nominees to our Board.

PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board recognizes that it is important for the Company's directors to possess a diverse array of backgrounds and skills, whether in terms of education, business acumen, accounting and financial expertise, risk-management experience, or experience with other organizations. When considering director candidates, the CNGC and the Board take into account these factors as well as other characteristics that, in their judgment, will contribute in a meaningful way to increasing the fundamental value of Ally and creating long-term value for stockholders. These characteristics include independence, the ability to provide guidance on Ally's risk profile and effective challenge on Ally's strategy in the context of its risk profile, the ability to make independent and disinterested decisions in the balanced and best interests of Ally's stockholders as a whole, the ability and willingness to devote sufficient time and attention to Ally, personal and professional integrity, honesty, ethics, and values, and the candidate's overall fit within the existing mix of director characteristics. While not intended to be exhaustive, the following matrix highlights a number of relevant skills possessed by some or all of the 12 nominees.  
In addition, the CNGC and the Board consider diversity in the characteristics of director candidates, including each candidate's perspective and background, with the ultimate aim of enhancing the Board's ability to perform its oversight function most effectively.    
[BEGIN TABLE]
   -6-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In their consideration of director candidates, the CNGC and the Board also take into account the Board's responsibility to provide direction and oversight for the Company's business and affairs. In its oversight role, the Board's primary responsibilities include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing general direction, guidance, and effective challenge on Ally's strategy in the context of its risk profile, including reviewing strategic, business, and financial objectives and plans and monitoring performance against all of them; 
• selecting the CEO, and through the CNGC, setting goals and compensation for, and evaluating the performance of, the CEO and other identified senior executives and overseeing compensation policies relative to risks and applicable law; 
• through the CNGC, reviewing succession plans for the CEO and other identified senior executives; 
• through the Risk Committee (RC), establishing and approving Ally's risk-appetite framework; 
• through the Audit Committee (AC), monitoring the integrity of Ally's financial statements and financial-reporting process and the adequacy of its financial and other internal controls, including disclosure controls and procedures; 
• requiring and, through the AC and the RC, reviewing effective compliance systems and policies for ethical and legal conduct, including procedures for confidential, anonymous, and non-retaliatory reporting of unethical or illegal behavior; and 
• establishing the proper "tone at the top" by setting clear expectations for Ally's ethical behavior and compliance with applicable law, including monitoring management's promotion of integrity, honesty, and ethical and legal conduct throughout Ally. 
[END TABLE]
The CNGC and the Board are dedicated to assembling directors who excel in fulfilling these responsibilities, exercise independent leadership and oversight of management, and operate in a cohesive and effective manner. Each director candidate possesses valued backgrounds, skills, and other characteristics, and collectively, these director candidates are positioned to meaningfully contribute to increasing the fundamental value of Ally and creating long-term value for stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   -7-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board has affirmatively determined in its business judgment that each of Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Bacon, Ms. Shineman, Ms. Breakiron-Evans, Mr. Cary, Ms. Clark, Mr. Fennebresque, Ms. Magner, Mr. Sharples, Mr. Stack, and Mr. Steib is independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards and applicable SEC rules (each independent and an independent director). The Board has determined that Mr. Brown, the Company's CEO, is not independent due to his position as an executive officer of the Company. In evaluating the independence of each director candidate, transactions, relationships, and arrangements between the director candidate or any related person or interest and the Company or any of its subsidiaries were assessed. These included a variety of financial-services relationships—such as deposit accounts, extensions of credit, and investment services—and one commercial arrangement involving the provision of services in the ordinary course of business to Ally. All of these transactions, relationships, and arrangements were judged to have been made on terms and under circumstances at least as favorable to the Company or its subsidiaries as those that were prevailing at the time for comparable transactions, relationships, or arrangements with unrelated persons or interests or those that would have applied to unrelated persons or interests. In addition, none of these transactions, relationships, or arrangements were determined to require disclosure under Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K. The Board concluded as well that no independent director has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Set forth here is a brief description of the backgrounds, skills, and other characteristics that led the CNGC and the Board to conclude that the director candidates should be nominated for election at the Annual Meeting.

BOARD GOVERNANCE MATTERS
In identifying and recommending candidates to stand for election to the Board, the CNGC may consider existing directors for renomination and may use search firms or other resources to identify other potential director candidates. The CNGC also considers potential director candidates who are recommended by stockholders in compliance with applicable law and listing rules and our Bylaws. Stockholders desiring to recommend candidates for membership on the Board for consideration by the CNGC should address their recommendations in writing, including all information required by our Bylaws, to the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, Ally Financial Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 500 Woodward Avenue, MC: MI-01-10-CORPSEC, Detroit, Michigan 48226. The CNGC uses the same criteria to evaluate all potential director candidates regardless of how they have been identified.
The effectiveness of these policies and processes for identifying and considering potential director candidates is assessed by the CNGC in connection with its periodic evaluation of the performance of the Board and each committee as contemplated by the Board's Governance Guidelines (Governance Guidelines).
MEETING ATTENDANCE
Directors are strongly encouraged to attend each annual meeting of stockholders in order to provide an opportunity for informal communication between directors and stockholders and to enhance the Board's understanding of stockholder priorities and perspectives. All existing directors attended the last annual meeting of stockholders on May 8, 2018.
The Board met eight times during 2018. Each nominee who is currently a director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings held in 2018 by the Board during the period when the director was serving in that capacity and (2) the total number of meetings held in 2018 by all applicable committees during the period when the director was serving on those committees.
THE BOARD'S LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
A majority of the full Board elects the Chairman, and under our Bylaws, the Chairman is elected from among Ally's independent directors. Mr. Hobbs serves as the Chairman of the Board and is a non-executive and independent director. Mr. Brown is our CEO.
The Board believes that separating the roles of Chairman and CEO is currently in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders because, based on the Company's present circumstances, the structure provides a balance between strategic development and independent oversight of management. The Board, however, maintains its flexibility to make this determination at any given point in time to provide appropriate leadership for the Company as circumstances warrant.
Under the Governance Guidelines, the Chairman (or in the Chairman's absence, an alternate director designated by the Chairman or, if the Chairman has not made a designation, an alternate director designated by a majority of the independent directors then present) will preside at Board meetings and executive sessions of the independent or non-management directors. The Chairman also has the following responsibilities: (1) serve as a liaison between the independent directors and management, (2) periodically communicate with the CEO to discuss matters of importance to the independent directors, (3) provide for adequate deliberations on all agenda items and other matters properly brought before the Board, and (4) perform other duties that are appropriate for a non-executive chair and that a majority of the independent directors may identify from time to time.

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board's primary responsibilities include providing general direction, guidance, and effective challenge on Ally's strategy in the context of its risk profile and, through the RC, establishing and approving Ally's risk-appetite framework.
The RC is composed of only independent directors and has oversight over Ally's global risk-management framework. Among the RC's specific duties are the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review Ally's global risk-management framework and oversee management's responsibility for ensuring that the framework is commensurate with Ally's structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size; 
• review reports from the Chief Risk Officer on the risk-management policies of Ally's global operations and the operation of its global risk-management framework, including reports on risk-management deficiencies, the resolution of those deficiencies, and emerging risks; 
• review reports and trends on Ally's material risks as set forth in its risk-appetite framework and reports from management on its actions to assess, monitor, and control those risks; 
• review reports and trends on Ally's liquidity planning and capital-management processes, and at least annually, review and approve the contingency-funding plan, any material revisions to it, and stress-test policies and procedures; 
• review reports and trends on Ally's program for managing compliance risk; 
• review reports on the new-product-approval process, including risks and performance of high-risk-rated products and alignment to the risk-appetite framework; 
• review reports and trends on Ally's information-technology risks (including cybersecurity risk) and related risk-mitigation plans; 
• at least annually, review and approve Ally's business-continuity-and-testing plans; 
• at least annually, review and approve Ally's model-risk-management plan, and periodically review reports and trends on Ally's model-risk-management program; and 
• at least annually, approve Ally's loan-review plan, and periodically review reports from Ally's loan-review function. 
[END TABLE]
The RC also meets in joint session with the AC, at least annually, to discuss with management the guidelines and policies for assessing and managing Ally's exposure to risks, including major financial risk exposures, and the steps management has taken to monitor, control, report on, and, as necessary, disclose those exposures.
In addition, the CNGC is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company's executive-compensation policies and practices and confirming that those policies and practices do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking and that any level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The AC correspondingly has responsibility to oversee the effectiveness of the Company's risk management and internal controls that are designed to (1) safeguard assets, (2) confirm the accuracy and integrity of accounting, financial reporting, and disclosures, (3) maintain compliance with ethical standards, policies, procedures, and applicable laws, and (4) promote effectiveness and efficiency of operations.
While each of these committees is responsible for evaluating specified risks and overseeing the management of those risks, the full Board is regularly updated on the state of the Company's risk profile, risk appetites, and enterprise-wide risk-management program and considers them in assessing and directing the strategy and the business of the Company. Our independent Chairman and our CEO are individually focused as well on the Company's risk-management policies and practices.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Our director-compensation program is designed to attract and retain directors with the characteristics described in Director Qualifications and Responsibilities earlier in this proxy statement and to provide fair compensation for the work required of a director in a company with Ally's size, scope, business model, and risk profile. Our director-compensation program is reviewed by the CNGC—with advice from its compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook)—and approved by the Board consistent with the Ally Financial Inc. Non-Employee Directors Equity Compensation Plan, amended and restated effective May 2, 2017, as approved by our stockholders.  
Consistent with the Governance Guidelines, Mr. Brown does not receive any separate compensation for his service on the Board. 
Each non-employee director is awarded an annual retainer following the annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, this annual retainer totaled $225,000 and was composed of $90,000 in cash and $135,000 in director deferred stock units, which each represent the right to receive one share of our common stock upon the director's departure from the Board (Director DSUs). Director DSUs granted as part of the annual retainer are prorated for directors who join the Board after the annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, when first elected or appointed to the Board, a new director is granted a one-time award of Director DSUs in the amount of $100,000, which vests quarterly over one year.
Our independent Chairman is not an executive of the Company, but he plays an active leadership role in the Board's oversight of management. As a result, after the annual meeting, he receives an additional annual retainer, which in 2018 totaled $275,000 and was composed of $110,000 in cash and $165,000 in Director DSUs.
An additional annual retainer is paid after the annual meeting to each non-employee director who serves as chair of a standing committee of the Board. In 2018, an annual cash retainer of $60,000 was paid to the chair of the AC and the chair of the RC, and an annual cash retainer of $50,000 was paid to the chair of the CNGC and the chair of the DTC. Further, each non-employee director receives at the same time a separate annual retainer for each standing committee on which the director serves, including as chair, which in 2018 was $20,000 for each committee. In 2018, a meeting fee of $2,000 was payable to each non-employee director for each Board or applicable committee meeting in excess of eight per year. Each member of the AC, other than Mr. Blakely and Ms. Clark, received an additional cash payment of $6,000 for excess meetings of the AC in 2018. Ms. Clark received an additional cash payment of $4,000 for excess meetings of the AC in 2018.    
Consistent with the Governance Guidelines, non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to their service on the Board. Furthermore, under our Certificate of Incorporation, directors are limited in their liability and indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law for their service in that capacity.
Ally allows its non-employee directors to defer from 0% to 100% of their cash retainers in 25% increments. These deferrals can be made into either fully vested Director DSUs or a cash account that is credited with interest quarterly. Interest earned on a cash account is based on the average rate offered by Ally Bank for deposits in its online savings accounts.
For 2019, on the recommendation of the CNGC, the Board has determined to reduce the annual retainer for our independent Chairman to $150,000 (composed of $60,000 in cash and $90,000 in Director DSUs) and to eliminate excess meeting fees.

OTHER GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics to promote integrity in the workplace, in the marketplace, and in our communities. The Code of Conduct and Ethics applies to all of Ally's officers and employees, including the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Controller. We will post any amendment to the Code of Conduct and Ethics, as well as any waiver that is required to be disclosed under applicable SEC rules or NYSE listing standards, on the Company's website at http://www.ally.com/about/investor/policies-charters/. There were no waivers from any provision of the Code of Conduct and Ethics in 2018 that were required to be disclosed.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
The Board has adopted a written Related Party Transactions Policy and Protocols (Related-Person Transaction Policy) that requires the Board or a committee of the Board to review and to approve or ratify any related-person transaction. The authority to review and to approve or ratify related-person transactions has been delegated to the CNGC in its charter.
A related-person transaction under the Related-Person Transaction Policy is an existing or currently proposed transaction or series of similar transactions for which disclosure under Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K is mandated—that is, where (1) Ally was or will be a participant, (2) the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and (3) any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The term related person under Item 404(a) means, at the applicable time, (a) any director or director nominee of Ally, (b) any executive officer of Ally, (c) any beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of Ally's voting securities, and (d) any immediate family member (as defined in Item 404) of any of those directors, nominees, executive officers, or beneficial owners. An indirect material interest can arise from a related person's position or relationship with a firm, corporation, or other entity that engages in a transaction with Ally (excluding any interest arising only from the person's position as a director of such an entity, the person's direct or indirect attributed ownership of less than a 10% equity interest in such a corporate or similar entity, or the person's position as a limited partner with less than a 10% direct or indirect attributed interest in such a partnership entity).
The following categories of transactions are treated as appropriately approved or pre-approved for purposes of the Related-Person Transaction Policy: (i) director or executive-officer compensation that is separately approved by the Board or the CNGC, including the reimbursement of ordinary-course expenses consistent with Ally's policies, (ii) indemnification or advancement of expenses consistent with Ally's Certificate of Incorporation and any related written agreement, (iii) financial services that are provided by Ally in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features, and (iv) transactions where the interest of the related person arises solely from the ownership of our common stock and all holders of our common stock receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.
Information about any potential related-person transaction must be reported to and reviewed by the Company's General Counsel. If the General Counsel determines that a related-person transaction is being proposed, the matter will be referred to the CNGC or, if necessary, the Board for review. If any transaction is executed without the prior approval of the CNGC or the Board and if the CNGC or the Board decides not to ratify it, the Company's management must rescind or terminate the transaction as promptly and on as favorable of terms as feasible.

   -22-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
OTHER GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Under the Related-Person Transaction Policy, when considering whether to approve or ratify a related-person transaction, the CNGC or the Board will consider (A) the commercial reasonableness and arm's-length nature of the transaction, (B) the business purpose and timing of the transaction, (C) the benefits likely to accrue to Ally from the transaction, (D) the nature and opportunity costs of alternative transactions, (E) the materiality and character of the related person's interest, (F) the effect of the transaction on the independence of any director or director nominee, (G) actual or potential conflicts of interest for the related person, (H) reputational risks for Ally, and (I) other relevant facts and circumstances.
There has been no transaction since January 1, 2018, that is required to be reported under Item 404(a) but that did not require review and approval or ratification under the Related-Person Transaction Policy or for which the Related-Person Transaction Policy was not followed.
SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Any proposal that a stockholder wishes to be considered for inclusion in Ally's proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 must be received in writing by Ally not later than November 23, 2019. We recommend that any stockholder proposal be delivered by means that provide proof of the date of delivery, such as certified mail (postage prepaid and return receipt requested). Please note that SEC Rule 14a-8 addresses when we must include a stockholder proposal in our proxy materials, including eligibility and procedural requirements that apply to the proponent.
Any stockholder proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders under SEC Rule 14a-8 (including any director nomination) but that is sought to be presented at that annual meeting under our Bylaws must be received in writing by Ally not earlier than January 8, 2020, and not later than February 7, 2020. Such a proposal (including any director nomination) also must satisfy the information and other requirements specified in our Bylaws, which are available on our web site at https://www.ally.com/resources/pdf/corporate/ally-bylaws.2016-03-16.pdf.

 (b)  Under SEC rules, stock units are not treated as beneficially owned if the holder does not have the right to acquire the underlying stock within 60 days of March 12, 2019, or if the stock units will be settled in cash and therefore do not represent the right to acquire stock. Amounts reflected in the following table comprise beneficially owned units included in the table above as well as time-based restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs) that are excluded from the table above. For tax reasons, Ally issued some of the RSUs as restricted stock awards rather than restricted stock units, but we include all of them in the term RSUs.

The CEO, all other Purview Executives, all directors, and specified associated persons are subject to personal trading restrictions to further align the interests of management and directors with those of stockholders. The restrictions apply to all of Ally's securities, including common stock, preferred stock, and debt. In the absence of an exception granted in accordance with Ally's Enterprise General Insider Trading and Blackout Policy, the restrictions prohibit (1) any transaction that hedges the person's economic interest in and exposure to the full rewards and risks of ownership in a security of Ally, (2) any put or call option, futures contract, forward contract, swap, or other derivative transaction that relates to a security of Ally and any similar speculative transaction (excluding, for clarity, any transaction under Ally's compensation plans), (3) any short sale, including a short sale against the box, of a security of Ally, (4) any pledge of a security of Ally as collateral, including through a margin account (excluding, for clarity, any pledge to a charitable organization that is recognized as such under applicable tax law), and (5) any limit order involving a security of Ally (excluding a limit order that by its terms is automatically canceled if not filled before the end of the same trading day).
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, our officers (as defined in Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 16a-1), and any person who beneficially owns more than 10% of the Company's common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company's common stock with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all forms that they file with the SEC pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. To the Company's knowledge based solely on its review of the copies received by the Company during or with respect to 2018 and written representations from reporting persons that no other forms or reports were required to be filed, the Company believes that each person who was a reporting person during 2018 timely filed the reports required by Section 16(a) during 2018, with the following exception: Due to an administrative error by the Company, late Form 4 filings were made on May 31, 2018, to report the shares of common stock that had been withheld by the Company to satisfy tax obligations associated with the settlement of previously reported equity-based awards in 2018 and prior years for each of the following persons: Mr. Brown and Ms. Morais (with respect to shares withheld in connection with 6 settlement dates), Mr. DeBrunner (with respect to shares withheld in connection with 7 settlement dates), and Mr. Stengel (with respect to shares withheld in connection with 2 settlement dates).

Executive Summary
2018 Business Highlights
In 2018, Ally delivered strong financial and operating results while positioning the company for growth in 2019 and beyond. Accomplishments during 2018 reflect our leading auto and deposit franchises, customer-centric product-expansion initiatives, and commitment to driving long-term stockholder value through efficient capital management. 
Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95 in 2018 were up 45% year over year, while adjusted EPS of $3.34 was up 39% year over year. We generated a Return on Equity (ROE) of 9.4% in 2018, up 251 basis points year over year, and a Core Return on Tangible Common Equity (Core ROTCE) of 12.3%, up 256 basis points year over year. Total deposits increased in a highly competitive market by $12.9 billion for the year, including $4.5 billion of retail deposit growth in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly growth ever. 
We successfully returned approximately $1.2 billion of capital to stockholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share-repurchase program in the third quarter of 2016, we have bought back over $2.0 billion in common stock, reducing total shares outstanding by more than 16%. 
Our auto business leveraged its strong dealer relationships and leading market position to expand risk-adjusted returns on over $35 billion of consumer auto originations in 2018. The retail auto net charge-off rate declined 15 basis points to 1.33%. 
Overall, we continue to deliver long-term stockholder value, with a strong foundation in auto finance and ongoing momentum in growth businesses and digital product offerings.
Additional highlights from 2018 are set forth in the following table. These highlights and other portions of this CD&A include non-GAAP financial measures—such as adjusted EPS and Core ROTCE. Non-GAAP financial measures supplement the results that are reported according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may be useful to readers, but they should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results. The differences between non-GAAP financial measures and comparable GAAP financial measures are reconciled in Appendix A of this proxy statement.

Ally's Executive-Compensation Program
Ally believes that there should be a strong linkage between compensation and performance as well as alignment with good governance principles and stockholder interests. This linkage is embodied throughout our executive-compensation program, including (1) the Annual Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan), which governs the awards of cash-based incentive compensation, and (2) the Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP), which governs the awards of equity-based incentive compensation.
2018 Compensation Decisions
In December 2018 and January 2019, the CNGC determined the total compensation for each of the NEOs under our executive-compensation program based on performance in 2018. Refer to Compensation Program Governance—CNGC Process later in this CD&A. The following table summarizes the CNGC's decisions on total compensation (base salary, cash-based incentive awards, PSUs, and RSUs) for the NEOs for 2018 performance under our executive-compensation program.

[END TABLE]
Compensation Philosophy
Ally's compensation philosophy is that there should be a strong linkage between compensation and performance as well as alignment with good governance principles and stockholder interests. In support of this compensation philosophy, Ally's executive-compensation program is structured to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align with long-term value creation for our stockholders; 
• Provide appropriate short- and long-term incentives based on individual, business, and Company performance; 
• Encourage prudent, but not excessive, risk taking; 
• Provide a total compensation opportunity competitive with market practice and reflective of the responsibilities of the role; and 
• Encourage retention of key executives. 
[END TABLE]
Elements and Mix of Executive Compensation
Total compensation under Ally's executive-compensation program is primarily composed of cash base salary, annual cash-based incentive awards, and long-term equity-based incentive awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total Pay Mix — As illustrated in the following table, the target mix of compensation for our CEO is 40% cash, which is composed of both base salary and annual cash-based incentives, and 60% long-term equity-based incentives. The target mix for our other NEOs is 50% cash and 50% long-term equity-based incentives. Long-term equity-based incentives awarded to all NEOs are granted in the form of PSUs for 50% of the value and RSUs for the remaining 50% of the value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash Base Salaries — Base salary is determined based on market levels for the responsibilities of each NEO and individual considerations of performance and experience. 
• Incentive Awards — Incentive awards are funded through an annual incentive pool based on Ally's financial performance, with the pool then allocated based on evaluations of the attainment of individual performance objectives. 
    i.  Annual Cash-Based Incentive Awards — A portion of the incentive awards for NEOs is delivered in the form of annual cash-based incentive awards.

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
[BEGIN TABLE]
    ii.  Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Awards  — A portion of the incentive awards for NEOs is delivered in the form of (1) PSUs that vest in whole on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the achievement of applicable performance goals and continued employment through that time and (2) RSUs that vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third on the second anniversary of the grant date, and one-third on the third anniversary of the grant date, in each case, subject to continued employment through that time. PSUs and RSUs are settled in shares of Ally's common stock.

[END TABLE]
At our 2018 annual meeting, we provided our stockholders the opportunity to vote on an advisory resolution approving the compensation paid to our NEOs in 2017. Approximately 93% of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at that meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal voted in support of the resolution. The CNGC will continue to monitor the feedback we receive from our stockholders through say-on-pay advisory votes and other channels and will consider this feedback in overseeing our executive-compensation program.
CNGC Process
Ally's executive-compensation program is overseen by the CNGC. In its deliberations on compensation matters, the CNGC seeks the input of Ally's independent risk-management function and also consults with the Chairs of the RC and the AC as appropriate. Neither the CEO nor the other NEOs are present for their respective pay discussions.
Compensation recommendations for the NEOs other than the CEO are presented to and discussed with the CNGC by the CEO. Factors that were discussed and considered by the CNGC include Ally's financial and operating results, business-unit or corporate-function results, individual performance evaluations, risk scorecards, control-function input, and market data. The CEO's unique insight into our business and day-to-day interaction with the NEOs provide a valuable perspective to the CNGC for its deliberations. The CNGC then evaluates the NEOs and determines and approves their compensation.
The CNGC evaluates the CEO and determines and approves his compensation without his involvement.

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Company engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners to provide consulting assistance on matters pertaining to executive compensation, including an updated competitive assessment of the compensation for Purview Executives.
FW Cook served as a compensation consultant to the CNGC during 2018 and for the 2018–2019 compensation cycle. The CNGC is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of FW Cook. FW Cook provides ongoing advice with respect to the compensation plans covering the executives, including our NEOs, and non-employee directors. FW Cook, as requested, attends meetings of the CNGC involving compensation matters, reviews compensation materials developed by management in advance of the CNGC meetings, and shares information on market practices and trends with the CNGC. FW Cook undertakes no separate work for Ally. The CNGC assessed the independence of FW Cook under applicable NYSE listing standards and SEC rules and determined that its work for the CNGC does not raise any conflicts of interest.
Employment Agreements
The NEOs are employed on an at-will basis, and no NEO is party to an employment agreement with the Company.
Severance
The NEOs are eligible for benefits under the Ally Financial Inc. Severance Plan. See Potential Payments Upon a Termination later in this proxy statement.
Clawback Provisions and Loss Trigger Review
In connection with its executive-compensation risk assessment in 2018, the Company confirmed its right to recoup cash and equity incentive payments in the event those payments were based on a materially inaccurate statement of earnings or other performance criteria, a material misrepresentation or a mistake irrespective of the source or cause, or other similar conduct or circumstances. A recipient who fails to promptly repay Ally in such an event is subject to termination of employment.
Ally also engages in a "loss trigger" review, which is applicable to Material Risk Takers (MRTs) who received deferred incentive-compensation awards (cash- or equity-based) for any year in which they were classified as MRTs. Prior to the payout of any deferred incentive-compensation award to an MRT, the Company determines if a significant loss or other negative risk outcome has occurred that relates to the risk-taking activities of the MRT. The Company's senior leadership is responsible for assessing the involvement and responsibility of the MRT in such a significant loss or other negative risk outcome and may recommend a downward adjustment or forfeiture of any unpaid portion of the incentive compensation awarded to the MRT. Any recommended reduction or forfeiture of deferred incentive compensation is subject to review and approval by the CNGC as provided in our Enterprise Material Risk Taker Policy.
Stock-Ownership Guidelines
The Board believes that the interests of management and stockholders are further aligned by stock-ownership guidelines for the CEO and other Purview Executives. During 2018, the Board approved a number of enhancements to these guidelines, including an increase in the CEO's stock-ownership requirement from 5 times base salary to 6 times base salary and a reduction in the amount of unvested RSUs and PSUs that are treated as owned for this purpose.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
With these enhancements in place, our Governance Guidelines provide for the following minimum ownership levels:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Officer  Stock-Ownership Requirement    
    Officer  Stock-Ownership Requirement    
    CEO  6 times cash base salary    
    Other NEOs  3 times cash base salary    
    Other Purview Executives  2 times cash base salary    
[END TABLE]
Assessing Compensation Competitiveness
We compare the total compensation of our NEOs against that of executives of companies with whom we compete for senior-executive talent. We use publicly available pay data from a peer group of companies approved by the CNGC to conduct the competitive assessment for the CEO and CFO positions.
Ally's peer group comprises the 17 banking and financial-services companies listed in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• BB&T• Discover• PNC Financial 
• Capital One• Fifth Third Bancorp• Regions Financial 
• Charles Schwab• Huntington Bancshares• Sun Trust Banks 
• CIT Group• KeyCorp• Synchrony Financial 
• Citizens Financial Group• M&T Bank• U.S.  Bancorp 
• Comerica• Navient       
[END TABLE]
For the other NEO and senior-executive positions, we use market-survey data from multiple sources to conduct competitive assessments. When practical, the market surveys include companies that are part of the peer group approved by the CNGC. Updated 2018 survey data used for the remaining NEOs and other senior executives came from one or more sources, including the AON Hewitt Total Compensation Measurement™ Executive Survey, the Willis Towers Watson Executive Financial Services Survey, the Willis Towers Watson Executive General Industry Survey, the McLagan Partners Consumer Retail and Small Banking Survey, and the McLagan Partners Top Management Survey. Because multiple sources were used and not all survey participants provided data for all of the positions served by the remaining NEOs, it is not possible to identify the survey participants included in the competitive data analyzed for positions other than the CEO and the CFO.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   -33-  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
When we measure the compensation of our NEOs against the peer group and survey data, we compare our compensation to the median. On an individual basis, compensation for any executive may be set above or below the median based on a variety of factors, including time in the position, sustained performance over time, criticalness to retain, and skill set and experience relative to external market counterparts. Compensation will also vary above or below the median based on Company and individual performance. The CNGC does not benchmark against the peer group and survey data but instead considers them as one data point in its decision-making.
Components of Ally's Compensation Program
As outlined in Compensation Design—Elements and Mix of Executive Compensation earlier in this CD&A, total compensation for our NEOs consists primarily of cash base salary, annual cash-based incentive awards, and long-term equity-based incentives in the form of PSUs and RSUs. In addition, we offer limited benefits and perquisites. 
Cash Base Salary
Under our compensation philosophy, cash base salary is intended to provide a predictable level of compensation. It is determined based on market levels for the responsibilities of each NEO and individual considerations of performance and experience.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Annual Cash-Based Incentive Awards
For details on the annual cash-based incentive awards granted to the NEOs in respect of 2018 performance, see Executive Summary—2018 Compensation Decisions earlier in this CD&A and the Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement.
Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Awards
A central principle of our executive-compensation program is linking the compensation of our NEOs directly to Company performance by awarding at least 50% of their total compensation in the form of PSUs and RSUs. The CNGC believes that this approach further aligns the interests of our leaders and our stockholders, as the ultimate value received depends on the share price in the future after the awards vest and the shares are sold and, in the case of PSUs, the level of attainment of the applicable performance goals.
The PSUs granted to our NEOs in 2017 and 2018 have a two-year performance period followed by an additional year of required service, after which earned PSUs fully vest and settle in shares. The PSUs granted in 2019 have a three-year performance period with no additional service requirement. Any dividends declared over the three-year vesting period are accumulated and paid at the time of settlement based on the number of PSUs earned at the conclusion of the performance period.
The performance metrics applicable to the PSUs are Core ROTCE and total stockholder value growth rate (TSV), each having an equal weight. The CNGC believes that these two metrics align executive compensation with the Company's operating performance, risk appetite, and long-term stockholder returns. The selection of Core ROTCE, which is a metric widely used in the banking industry, incents management to produce an appropriate return on equity for stockholders. TSV, which is defined as growth in adjusted tangible book value per share plus dividends per share, was selected because the CNGC believes that growth in the tangible book value of the Company should result in increased long-term value creation for stockholders and is directly impacted by management performance. Core ROTCE, TSV, and adjusted tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to comparable GAAP financial measures in Appendix A of this proxy statement. Under the ICP, which governs our PSUs, the CNGC has excluded from Core ROTCE and TSV the impact of designated items so that the performance goals reflect factors that management can directly control and that payout levels are not artificially inflated or impaired by factors unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business. Refer to Appendix A of this proxy statement for more detail on these designated items.  
The CNGC establishes threshold, target, and maximum goals for each metric that, in its judgment, suitably challenge management after taking into account factors such as the Company's prior-year performance, the current year's financial plan, and the multi-year strategic plan. PSUs pay out between 0% and 150% of target based on the achievement of these predetermined goals for Core ROTCE and TSV using a tiered structure rather than linear interpolation between goals. The goals established by the CNGC for the PSUs granted in 2017, 2018, and 2019 follow: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The performance period for our PSUs granted in 2017 is complete, and the CNGC has certified the results as reflected in the following charts.
The calculation of these results included adjustments for items designated by the CNGC at the time of grant, primarily to neutralize the effect of changes in tax laws (including the TCJ Act) and the effect of accounting changes (including Revenue from Contracts with Customers Accounting Standards Update 2014-09). The achievement of these results generated an expected future payout of 125% for recipients who complete their third year of service requirement.
The RSUs granted to our NEOs do not have explicit performance-based conditions, but their ultimate value depends on the share price in the future after the awards vest and the shares are sold. The RSUs vest and settle in shares in three equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant. Any dividends over the vesting period are accumulated and paid at the time of settlement.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Benefits and Perquisites
We provide our NEOs with health and welfare benefits under the broad-based program generally available to all of our employees. This allows our NEOs and employees to receive certain benefits that are not readily available to individuals except through an employer and to receive certain benefits on a pre-tax basis.
Our benefit program includes the tax-qualified Ally Financial Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (Savings Plan). We provide the Savings Plan to support our employees in saving for retirement in a manner that is favorable from a tax perspective. Eligible compensation under the Savings Plan is composed of salary and cash bonus. Under the Savings Plan, after one year of employment, employee contributions up to 6% of eligible compensation are matched 100% by Ally, and this matched amount vests in full immediately. Effective the first of the month following 30 days of employment, the Savings Plan also provides for a 2% nonmatching contribution on eligible compensation and an additional discretionary nonmatching contribution on eligible base pay of up to 2%, which is subject to the Company's performance. Nonmatching contributions fully vest after the individual has been employed for three years.
Ally also maintains the Enhanced Retirement Savings Plan, which is a nonqualified benefit equalization plan for highly compensated employees. This plan was designed to allow for the equalization of benefits for highly compensated employees when such employees' qualified plan benefits were limited by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). Ally suspended nonqualified contributions to this plan in 2009 and has not made any since that time, including in 2018. Certain NEOs maintain balances within the plan. This plan is maintained as an unfunded plan, and all expenses for administration of the plan and payment of amounts to participants are borne by Ally.
In addition to broad-based benefits, the NEOs receive limited additional benefits and perquisites so that the Company can remain competitive in attracting and retaining executive talent. These benefits are itemized in the notes to our Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement.
Other
Former Executive Officers
For details of compensation paid to Messrs. Halmy and Russi during 2018, refer to Payments to Mr. Halmy in Connection with his Departure and Payments to Mr. Russi in Connection with his Departure later in this proxy statement.
Tax and Accounting
Section 162(m) of the Code limits the tax deductibility of compensation for certain executive officers to $1 million. Prior to the enactment of the TCJ Act in December 2017, Section 162(m) provided an exemption from this limitation for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation." The TCJ Act, however, repealed the exemption for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to transition relief for certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The CNGC is not limited to paying compensation that is fully deductible and retains the flexibility to consider tax and accounting impacts as some factors among many in structuring our executive-compensation program.

 (b)  The amounts in this column for 2018 represent the annual cash bonuses paid to the NEOs in February 2019 in respect of 2018 performance, based on achievement of the CNGC's assessment of overall Company and individual performance. For additional information on these bonuses, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Ally's Compensation Program—Annual Cash-Based Incentive Awards earlier in this proxy statement. 
 (c)  The amounts in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair values of the RSUs and PSUs granted under the ICP to the NEOs, in each case, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The actual value that the NEOs will realize for these awards is a function of the value of the underlying shares if and when these awards vest and, for PSUs, the level of attainment of the applicable performance goal. The amounts for the PSUs were calculated based on the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718. For these amounts, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table below. The following are the values of the performance awards as of the grant date assuming attainment of the maximum level of performance: Mr. Brown, $4,162,530; Ms. LaClair, $825,037; Ms. Morais, $1,275,012; Mr. Stengel, $750,034; Mr. Timmerman, $540,033; Mr. Halmy, $1,162,530; and Mr. Russi, $1,125,006. For additional information on how we account for equity-based compensation, see Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 (a)  The amounts reflected in this column represent the number of shares of Ally common stock underlying (i) the supplemental one-time RSUs granted in 2015 that are scheduled to vest in equal annual amounts over four years following the date of grant, (ii) the RSUs granted to the NEOs in 2016, 2017, and 2018 that are scheduled to vest over three years from the date of grant, in each case, based solely on service and (iii) the PSUs granted to the NEOs in 2016 and 2017 (reflected based on actual achievement of 112.5% and 125%, respectively, for the performance periods that ended on December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018). 2017 PSUs for Messrs. Halmy and Russi were calculated to adjust the number of above-target shares that will be delivered by the percentage of calendar days during the performance period that they were employed by Ally.  
 (b)  The market values of the awards were calculated by multiplying the number of shares underlying the awards by $22.66, the closing price of Ally common stock on December 31, 2018. 
 (c)  The amounts reflected in this column represent the number of shares of Ally common stock underlying the PSUs granted to the NEOs in 2018 (with a performance period that is scheduled to end on December 31, 2019) and a service period that is scheduled to end on the third anniversary of the date of grant, assuming attainment of the performance metrics at the target performance level. The actual number of Ally shares, if any, that will vest will be based on (i) the level of achievement of the Core ROTCE and TSV performance goals as of the end of the performance period and (ii) satisfaction of the applicable service condition. For more information on the terms of these awards, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of Ally's Compensation Program—Long-Term Equity-Based Incentive Awards earlier in this proxy statement. 
 (d)  Number of RSUs and 2016 PSU, unrelated to the one-time RSUs granted on March 18, 2015, that have not vested for Mr. Timmerman are nonforfeitable, as these grants have attained retirement eligibility pursuant to the terms of the RSUs. 
 (e)  Number of RSUs and 2016 PSU for Messrs. Halmy and Russi are nonforfeitable pursuant to the terms of the RSUs.

Potential Payments Upon a Termination
Ally Financial Inc. Severance Plan
All NEOs are eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, which entitles each NEO to receive (i) two times the sum of their annual base salary and designated annual cash-incentive compensation opportunity, (ii) the pro-rated designated annual cash-incentive compensation opportunity for the year of their termination, and (iii) a payment equal to 24 months of medical premiums valued at their COBRA rate, in the event of a qualifying termination of employment or a termination of service without cause (as summarized below), in each case, within the 24-month period immediately following a change in control. In the event of a qualifying termination that is not in connection with a change in control, our CEO is entitled to receive two times his base salary and all other NEOs are entitled to receive one times their base salary. The plan also provides for outplacement benefits at a level determined by the Company based on the individual's level within the organization, market conditions, and geographic area.
The Severance Plan generally defines qualifying terminations of employment as: (i) the elimination of a participant's current position, termination associated with the reduction in the total number of employees in the same department performing the same or similar job, or termination associated with a restructuring of different departments which results in the reduction in the total number of employees, including the participant, in the affected departments; (ii) a substantial change in current duties for which the participant no longer qualifies; (iii) a substantial change in the participant's current duties which results in a 20% or more reduction in the participant's base salary; or (iv) declining a geographic transfer in connection with the elimination of the participant's current position to a new position at a location more than 50 miles from the location of the participant's current position regardless of whether reimbursement of relocation expenses is offered.
Supplemental One-Time RSUs and Annual RSUs
In the event of a NEO's termination of employment (a) due to death, "disability" or "retirement," (b) by Ally without "cause" or (c) in the case of the Annual RSUs granted to the NEOs, due to a "qualifying termination" (as such terms are defined in the ICP and summarized below, the unvested portion of the RSUs will fully vest as of the date of such termination of service and will be paid as follows: (i) in the case of a termination due to death or disability, within 75 days of such termination of employment and (ii) in the case of a termination by Ally without cause due to a qualifying termination or due to retirement, on the award's original settlement dates.
In the case of the supplemental one-time RSUs granted to the NEOs in 2015, in the event of a NEO's termination of employment due to a qualifying termination, or retirement as approved by the Company, the unvested portion will fully vest and will be paid on the original settlement dates.
In the case of a NEO who is employed by a business unit of the Company, if the NEO is terminated (i) as a result of a "sale of such business unit" (as defined in the Incentive Plan and summarized below) or (ii) without cause or due to a qualifying termination, in each case, within the 24-month period immediately following the sale of such business unit, then all unvested RSUs will fully vest as of the date of such termination and will be paid on the award's original settlement dates.
In the event of a "change in control" (as defined in the Incentive Plan and summarized below), if the RSUs are not continued or converted into a restricted stock or RSU over to shares of the survivor or successor (or parent corporation) on a basis substantially equivalent to the consideration received by stockholders of Ally in connection with the change in control, the outstanding RSUs will vest and be immediately due and payable. If the RSUs are continued or converted as described above, then in the event of a termination of the NEO's employment without cause or due to a qualifying termination within the 24-month period following the change in control, the RSUs will fully vest and become immediately payable.

Annual PSUs
In the event of a NEO's termination of employment due to death or disability, the PSUs will fully vest as of the date of such termination of employment and will be paid within 75 days of such termination of employment, with the performance conditions applicable to the PSUs deemed achieved (i) at the target performance level if the termination of service occurs prior to the end of the performance period or (ii) based on actual performance if the termination of service occurs on or after the last day of the performance period.
In the event of a NEO's termination of employment (a) due to retirement, (b) by the Company without cause or (c) due to a qualifying termination (whether as a result of a sale of a business unit or otherwise), in each case, other than in connection with a change in control, the PSUs will fully vest as of the date of such termination of employment, subject to achievement of the applicable Core ROTCE and TSV performance conditions and will be payable on the award's original settlement dates. However, in the case of a termination of employment by the Company without cause or due to a qualifying termination (whether as a result of a sale of a business unit or otherwise), if the performance goals are achieved above the target performance level, the number of shares that will be payable in excess of the target number of shares will be prorated based on the number of calendar days during the performance period the NEO was employed by the Company.
In the event of a change in control, if the PSUs are not continued or converted into a restricted stock award over to shares of the survivor or successor (or parent corporation) on a basis substantially equivalent to the consideration received by stockholders of Ally in connection with the change in control, the outstanding PSUs will vest and be immediately due and payable. If the PSUs are continued or converted as described above, then in the event of a termination of the NEO's employment without cause or due to a qualifying termination within the 24-month period following the change in control, the RSUs will fully vest and the award will be payable on the earlier of (i) the original payment date or (ii) (a) the date of termination of employment for any reason other than due to death or disability or (b) within 75 days of the date of termination due to death or disability.  At the time of a change in control, PSUs are converted to restricted stock as follows: (1) if more than half of the performance period has elapsed at the time of the change in control and achievement of the performance metrics is determinable, as determined by the CNGC, the performance goals will be deemed achieved based on actual performance as of the date of the change in control; or (2) if less than half of the performance period has elapsed at the time of the change in control or achievement of the performance metrics is not determinable, the performance goals will be deemed achieved at the target performance level.
Under the Incentive Plan, "cause," "change in control," "disability," "qualifying termination," "retirement," and "sale of such business unit" are generally defined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Cause" generally means, unless otherwise defined in any employment agreement with the participant (if any) or as otherwise provided in an individual award agreement, the participant's: (i) felony indictment or misdemeanor conviction; (ii) failure to perform any material responsibility of the leadership position; (iii) a course of conduct, which would tend to hold the Company or any of its affiliates in disrepute or scandal, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion; (iv) failure to follow lawful directions of the Board; (v) any material breach of fiduciary duty to the Company; (vi) gross negligence; (vii) willful misconduct; (viii) failure to comply with a material Company policy; (ix) any act of fraud, theft, or dishonesty; (x) breach of any restrictive covenants set forth in the Incentive Plan; or (xi) failure to promptly repay any award payment that is determined to be owed to the Company pursuant to the recoupment or "clawback" provisions under the Incentive Plan. 
• "Change in control" generally means the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (i) any person or entity becomes, directly or indirectly, the beneficial owner of more than 30% of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; (ii) the replacement of a majority of the Company's directors during any 12-month period; (iii)

• "Disability" generally means, unless otherwise provided in an individual award agreement, (i) a long-term disability that entitles the participant to disability income payments under any long-term disability plan or policy provided by the Company under which the participant is covered, as such plan or policy is then in effect; or (ii) if such participant is not covered under a long-term disability plan or policy provided by the Company at such time for whatever reason, then the term "disability" means disability within the meaning of Treasury Reg. Section 1.409A-3(i)(4). 
• "Qualifying Termination" generally means a termination of employment or service as a result of any of the following: (i) elimination of the participant's current position or reduction in the total number of employees in the same department performing the same or similar job; (ii) a substantial change in current duties for which the employee no longer qualifies; (iii) a substantial change in current duties, which results in a 20% or more reduction in salary; or (iv) declining a geographic transfer to a new position offered to the participant upon the elimination of current position as an alternative to termination (provided that the participant was offered reimbursement of relocation expenses associated with the transfer in accordance with the Company's then-current relocation program). 
• "Retirement" generally means a termination of employment or service other than for cause following attainment of (i) age 55, and the total of age and years of service to the Company and its affiliates equals or exceeds 70, or (ii) age 65.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
Pay Ratio
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and SEC Regulation S-K require a public company to disclose the annual total compensation of its Principal Executive Officer (PEO), the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the company excluding the PEO, and the ratio of those two amounts. 
SEC rules permit us to identify our median employee once every three years if, during the last completed fiscal year, there were no changes in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay-ratio disclosure. We have concluded that, for 2018, there were no such changes. As a result, our median employee for 2017 is being used to calculate our 2018 pay ratio.
Median-Employee Determination for 2017
A list of all 7,912 employees, excluding the PEO, as of December 31, 2017, was prepared. Our 36 international employees (35 in Canada and 1 in Belgium) were excluded, resulting in 7,876 total employees. To determine our median employee from this adjusted employee population, we used base salary plus 2017 target incentive opportunities. Base salaries were annualized for permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of 2017.
2018 Pay Ratio Calculation
We determined our median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 utilizing the same methodology that is used in determining the total compensation of our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table earlier in this proxy statement. Further, annual total compensation of our PEO and our median employee were adjusted to include the cost of estimated employer contributions for medical and dental benefits and tuition reimbursements for 2018. As a result, the adjusted annual total compensation for 2018 of our PEO, Mr. Brown, was $9,607,777, which includes $16,211 of employer contributions for medical and dental benefits in 2018 in addition to compensation set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table earlier in this proxy statement. Mr. Brown's compensation is approximately 88 times our median employee's 2018 annual total compensation of $109,452. The Company believes that the foregoing ratio is a reasonable estimate determined in accordance with SEC rules.
Please note that SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions, and as result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to pay ratios reported by other companies.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-21 require us, at least every third calendar year, to hold a non-binding stockholder advisory vote at our annual meeting on the compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in our proxy statement in accordance with applicable SEC rules. This is commonly known as a say-on-pay advisory vote.
Under the Company's executive-compensation program, the NEOs are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term, strategic, and corporate goals as well as the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis along with the information in the compensation tables for additional details about the executive-compensation program, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of the NEOs.
Stockholders are asked to indicate their support for the NEO compensation as described in this proxy statement. This say-on-pay advisory vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation of the NEOs and the compensation philosophy, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, stockholders are requested to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, and the other related tables and disclosures."
This say-on-pay vote is advisory and, therefore, not binding on the Company, the CNGC, or the Board. The Board and the CNGC, however, greatly value the opinions of stockholders, and to the extent that there is a significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the CNGC will consider stockholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the advisory resolution approving the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT
The CNGC, with the assistance of Ally's Risk and Human Resources functions, conducts an annual assessment of the risks associated with Ally's compensation policies and practices. Based on the assessment conducted during 2018 and through the 2018–2019 compensation cycle, the CNGC believes that the design, implementation, and governance of Ally's incentive-compensation program are consistent with high standards of risk management (including the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies issued by the federal banking agencies) and that Ally's incentive-compensation policies and practices reflect an appropriate mix of compensation elements, balancing short-term and long-term performance objectives, cash- and equity-based compensation, and risks and rewards.
The CNGC in 2018 also reviewed Ally's compensation policies and practices as generally applicable to all of our employees and believes that these policies and practices do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking and that any level of risk that they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This conclusion has been reported by the CNGC to the Board. In addition, in keeping with this conclusion, Ally's Enterprise Compensation Policy authorizes the cancellation, recovery, or other recoupment of variable pay if the Board, the CNGC, or the CEO, as applicable, determines that the variable pay was based on a materially inaccurate statement of earnings or other performance criteria, a material misrepresentation or a mistake irrespective of the source or cause, or other similar conduct or circumstances.

PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The AC is solely and directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In connection with these responsibilities, the AC evaluates and monitors the qualifications, quality of service, objectivity, and independence of the firm. The AC is also involved in the selection and ongoing evaluation of the lead audit partner, including the regular rotation of the lead audit partner in compliance with applicable law. The AC approves all fees and terms of engagement of the firm.
After assessing the performance, qualifications, independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism of Deloitte & Touche LLP—the Company's current independent registered public accounting firm—the AC and the Board believe that the continued retention of Deloitte & Touche as our independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Deloitte & Touche has been serving the Company and its subsidiaries in this role for decades and has advised the Company that its members have no direct or indirect financial interest in the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The Board asks our stockholders to ratify the AC's engagement of Deloitte & Touche as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. The AC, however, will retain its sole authority over the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company's independent auditor. As a result, in the event that the engagement of Deloitte & Touche is not ratified by stockholders, the AC will consider that action in the ongoing exercise of its authority over the independent auditor but will be under no obligation to engage a new independent auditor. In addition, even if the engagement is ratified, the AC will retain its discretion to terminate the appointment at any time during the year, to engage a new independent auditor, and to take any other related action if judged by the AC to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. We also expect that these representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
The Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the Audit Committee's engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

FEES OF THE PRINCIPAL INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Total fees for professional services provided by our principal independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ($ in millions)     2018     2017

 Tax fees (c)     1     1 
 Total fees  $  12  $  12 
 (a)  Audit fees include fees for the integrated audit of Ally's annual Consolidated Financial Statements, reviews of interim financial statements included in Ally's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. In addition, this category includes approximately $1 million in both 2018 and 2017, pertaining to services such as comfort letters for securities issuances and consents to the incorporation of audit reports in filings with the SEC. 
 (b)  Audit-related fees include fees for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the principal accountant, including attest services related to servicing and compliance, agreed-upon procedures relating to securitizations and financial asset sales, and consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 
 (c)  Tax fees include fees for services performed for tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice, including preparation of tax returns and claims for refund. Tax planning and advice also include assistance with tax audits and appeals and tax advice related to specific transactions. 
[END TABLE]
Our Independent Auditor Services and Preapproval Policy is approved by the AC and sets forth the processes that must be followed when engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. For both audit services and non-audit services, the AC will consider whether the firm's provision of the services is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence and would not impair the independence of the firm with respect to us. The AC will also consider any other matters it deems relevant, including as appropriate whether the firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service given its familiarity with our business and operations.
Consistent with the Independent Auditor Services and Preapproval Policy, the independent registered public accounting firm annually presents to the AC (1) an engagement letter that sets forth the annual integrated audit services (including quarterly reviews) and fees and (2) a summary of services that sets forth statutory audits, projected non-audit reports, and other projected services that may be requested during the fiscal year together with corresponding fees. The AC will review and, in its discretion, preapprove these services and fees by appointing the firm and approving the engagement letter and the summary of services. 
Any proposed engagement of the firm for a statutory audit, a non-audit report, or other service that was preapproved in the summary of services is directed to our Controller's office, which is charged with verifying that the service was preapproved and will be provided consistent with the fees projected in the summary of services. If the fees for the preapproved service exceed or are expected to exceed the projected fees, the engagement must be approved by the Controller or Chief Tax Officer as applicable (in the case of total fees for the service of $100,000 or less), the Chair of the AC (in the case of total fees for the service of more than $100,000 but less than or equal to $500,000), or the AC (in the case of total fees for the service of more than $500,000).
Any proposed engagement of the firm for an audit or non-audit service that was not preapproved in the annual engagement letter or the summary of services and that does not exceed $500,000 in fees may be preapproved by the Chair of the AC, subject to the condition that the Chair's decision is presented to the AC at a subsequent meeting within a reasonable timeframe. Any proposed engagement of the firm for an audit or non-audit service that was not preapproved in the annual engagement letter or the summary of services and that exceeds $500,000 in fees must be submitted to the AC for preapproval.
Under the Independent Auditor Services and Preapproval Policy, no engagement may be finalized, no financial commitment may be made, and no work may begin related to a proposed engagement of the firm until all appropriate preapprovals have been given and verifications have been made, except in the limited circumstance

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Management is responsible for the Company's internal control over financial reporting, preparation of consolidated financial statements, and overall accounting and financial-reporting processes. Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for planning and conducting an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of these financial statements with GAAP and as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company's Internal Audit function, under the direction of the Chief Audit Executive, is independent of the Company's business units, functionally reports to the AC, and is responsible for preparing an annual audit plan and conducting internal audits to test and evaluate the Company's risk management, governance, and internal controls. The AC is responsible for monitoring and overseeing these activities on behalf of the Board.
The AC, in connection with its monitoring and oversight responsibilities, assesses the activities and performance of the Company's independent auditor, which reports directly to the AC. Annually, the AC considers the results of an evaluation of the performance, qualifications, independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism of the independent auditor in determining whether to retain the firm for the next fiscal year. The AC oversees negotiations associated with the retention of the independent auditor and has the sole authority to approve the engagement letter and the audit fees. In accordance with SEC rules, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years that an individual partner may provide services. In conjunction with this five-year mandated rotation of the firm's lead audit partner, the AC and its Chair are directly involved in the selection of the independent auditor's new lead audit partner. The AC has sole authority and direct responsibility to appoint or replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Additionally, the AC has oversight responsibility for the Company's Internal Audit function, including the appointment, retention, performance evaluation, and compensation of the Company's Chief Audit Executive.
The AC discussed the interim financial and other information contained in each quarterly earnings announcement and periodic SEC filing with management and Deloitte & Touche prior to the public release of the announcement. The AC has reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte & Touche the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and Deloitte & Touche's evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the AC has discussed with Deloitte & Touche the matters that independent registered public accounting firms must communicate to audit committees under applicable PCAOB standards, including Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees) which superseded Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61. The AC has received the written disclosures and correspondence from Deloitte & Touche required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte and Touche's independence and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche its independence.
Based on these reviews and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

HOUSEHOLDING
SEC rules allow the delivery of one proxy statement, annual report, or notice of internet availability of proxy materials, as applicable, to all stockholders who share an address if specified conditions are met. This is called householding and can minimize the costs involved in printing and delivering proxy materials as well as the associated impact on the environment. For eligible stockholders who share an address, we are sending only one proxy statement, annual report, or notice of internet availability, as applicable, to that address unless we received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address.
If you are the beneficial owner but not the record holder of our common stock, your broker, bank, or other nominee may household our proxy statements, annual reports, or notices of internet availability, as applicable, for all stockholders at your address unless that nominee has received contrary instructions from one or more of the affected stockholders. If you want this householding to cease or if you want householding to commence, please notify your broker, bank, or other nominee.

Ally believes that the non-GAAP financial measures here may be useful to readers, but these are supplemental to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. 
Adjusted Earnings per Share (Adjusted EPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts GAAP Earnings per Share for revenue and expense items that are typically strategic in nature or that management otherwise does not view as reflecting the operating performance of the company. Management believes Adjusted EPS can help the reader better understand the operating performance of the core businesses and their ability to generate earnings. In the numerator of Adjusted EPS, GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders is adjusted for the following items: (1) excludes discontinued operations, net of tax, as Ally is primarily a domestic company and sales of international businesses and other discontinued operations in the past have significantly impacted GAAP EPS, (2) adds back the tax-effected non-cash Core Original Issue Discount, (3) excludes equity fair value adjustments (net of tax) related to ASU 2016-01, effective 1/1/2018, which requires change in the fair value of equity securities to be recognized in current period net income as compared to prior periods in which such adjustments were recognized through other comprehensive income, a component of equity, (4) adds back tax-effected repositioning items

[END TABLE]
primarily related to the extinguishment of high-cost legacy debt and strategic activities, (5) excludes certain discrete tax items that do not relate to the operating performance of the core businesses, and (6) adjusts for preferred stock capital actions (e.g., Series A) that have been taken by the company to normalize its capital structure.
Adjusted Efficiency Ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is helpful to readers in comparing the efficiency of its core banking and lending businesses with those of its peers. In the numerator of Adjusted Efficiency Ratio, total noninterest expense is adjusted for Insurance segment expense, representation and warranty expense and repositioning items primarily related to strategic activities. In the denominator, total net revenue is adjusted for Insurance segment revenue, Core Original Issue Discount and repositioning items related to strategic activities. 
Adjusted Tangible Book Value Per Share (Adjusted TBVPS) is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the book value of equity attributable to shareholders even if Core Original Issue Discount balance were accelerated immediately through the financial statements. As a result, management believes Adjusted TBVPS provides the reader with an assessment of value that is more conservative than GAAP common shareholder's equity per share. Adjusted TBVPS generally adjusts common equity for: (1) goodwill and identifiable intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) and (2) tax-effected Core Original Issue Discount balance to reduce tangible common equity in the event the corresponding discounted bonds are redeemed/tendered. In December 2017, tax-effected Core Original Issue Discount balance was adjusted from a statutory U.S. federal tax rate of 35% to 21% ("rate") as a result of changes to U.S. tax law. The adjustment conservatively increased the tax-effected Core Original Issue Discount balance and consequently reduced Adjusted TBVPS as any acceleration of the non-cash charge in the future periods would flow through the financial statements at a 21% rate versus a previously modeled 35% rate.   
Core Net Income Available to Common Stockholders is a non-GAAP financial measure that serves as the numerator in the calculations of Adjusted EPS and Core ROTCE and that, like those measures, is believed by management to help the reader better understand the operating performance of the core businesses and their ability to generate earnings. Core net income available to common shareholders adjusts GAAP net income available to common shareholders for discontinued operations net of tax, tax-effected Core Original Issue Discount expense, tax-effected changes in equity investments measured at fair value, tax-effected repositioning items primarily related to the extinguishment of high-cost legacy debt and strategic activities, certain discrete tax items and preferred stock capital actions.  
Core Original Issue Discount (Core OID) amortization expense is a non-GAAP financial measure for Original Issue Discount, primarily related to bond exchange Original Issue Discount which excludes international operations and future issuances. 
Core Outstanding Original Issue Discount Balance (Core OID balance) is a non-GAAP financial measure for outstanding OID, primarily related to bond exchange Original Issue Discount which excludes international operations and future issuances. 
Core Pre-tax Income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts pre-tax income from continuing operations by excluding (1) Core OID, (2) equity fair value adjustments related to ASU 2016-01, effective 1/1/2018, which requires change in the fair value of equity securities to be recognized in current period net income as compared to prior periods in which such adjustments were recognized through other comprehensive income, a component of equity, and (3) repositioning items primarily related to the extinguishment of high-cost legacy debt and strategic activities. Management believes core pre-tax income can help the reader better understand the operating performance of the core businesses and their ability to generate earnings.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   A-3  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Core Return on Tangible Common Equity (Core ROTCE) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is helpful for readers to better understand the ongoing ability of the company to generate returns on its equity base that support core operations. For purposes of this calculation, tangible common equity is adjusted for Core OID balance and net DTA. Ally's core net income attributable to common shareholders for purposes of calculating Core ROTCE is based on the actual effective tax rate for the period adjusted for any discrete tax items including tax reserve releases, which aligns with the methodology used in calculating adjusted earnings per share. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the numerator of Core ROTCE, GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders is adjusted for discontinued operations net of tax, tax-effected Core OID, fair value adjustments (net of tax) related to ASU 2016-01, effective 1/1/2018, which requires change in the fair value of equity securities to be recognized in current period net income as compared to prior periods in which such adjustments were recognized through other comprehensive income, a component of equity, tax-effected repositioning items primarily related to the extinguishment of high-cost legacy debt and strategic activities, certain discrete tax items and preferred stock capital actions.  
• In the denominator, GAAP shareholder's equity is adjusted for preferred equity and goodwill and identifiable intangibles net of DTL, Core OID balance, and net DTA.  
[END TABLE]
Tangible Common Equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as common stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. Ally considers various measures when evaluating capital adequacy, including tangible common equity. Ally believes that tangible common equity is important because we believe readers may assess our capital adequacy using this measure. Additionally, presentation of this measure allows readers to compare certain aspects of our capital adequacy on the same basis to other companies in the industry. For purposes of calculating Core ROTCE, tangible common equity is further adjusted for Core OID balance and net deferred tax asset.
Net Financing Revenue (excluding OID) excludes Core OID.
Total Stockholder Value (TSV) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as growth in adjusted TBVPS share plus dividends per share. 
Measurement of Performance for PSUs
Consistent with the ICP, for purposes of measuring performance under the PSUs granted by the Company, the CNGC has excluded from Core ROTCE and TSV the impact of designated items so that these performance goals reflect factors that management can directly control and that payout levels are not artificially inflated or impaired by factors unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business.
For the PSUs granted from 2017 through 2019, the designated items were—in each case, to the extent material and not taken into account in establishing the target levels—(1) litigation and regulatory judgments, charges or settlements and any accruals or reserves relating to litigation or regulatory matters, (2) the effect of changes in law applicable to Ally which shall be measured based on the effect of the changes on revenue, income, assets and liabilities demonstrably caused by such changes in law, (3) the effect of changes in accounting principles, including any related accounting restatements, (4) income, expenses, gains or losses from discontinued operations, (5) the charges and other costs and balance sheet impacts associated with any acquisition, divestiture, restructuring or pre-payment or other early retirement of outstanding debt, and, in the case of an acquisition, any income or loss associated with the acquired business or assets during the same fiscal period, and (6) any items that are categorized as unusual in nature or infrequently occurring within the meaning of GAAP.
