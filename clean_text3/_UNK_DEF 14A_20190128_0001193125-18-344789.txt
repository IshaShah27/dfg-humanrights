PROXY STATEMENT 
SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PRAXIS INTERNATIONAL INDEX FUND 
TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 28, 2019 
INTRODUCTION 
This proxy statement ("Proxy Statement") is being furnished to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees ("Board of Trustees") of Praxis Mutual Funds ("Trust") on behalf of the Praxis International Index Fund ("Fund"), a series of the Trust, to be voted at a special meeting ("Special Meeting") of shareholders of the Trust scheduled to be held on January 28, 2019. This Proxy Statement is first being mailed to shareholders on or about December 28, 2018. 
PROPOSAL: TO APPROVE A NEW INVESTMENT SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT 
The Special Meeting is being held to obtain shareholder approval of a new investment sub-advisory agreement for the Praxis International Index Fund ("New Sub-Advisory Agreement" or "new agreement"). The new agreement is with the Fund's current investment sub-adviser. Regulatory requirements relating to a business transaction involving the Fund's current investment sub-adviser resulted in a termination of the original sub-advisory agreement. Shareholder approval of the new agreement will allow the Fund's current investment sub-adviser to continue to provide investment sub-advisory services to the Fund. 
Aperio Group, LLC ("Sub-Adviser") has served as the investment sub-adviser to the Fund since the Fund's commencement of investment operations on December 31, 2010 pursuant to an investment sub-advisory agreement dated December 31, 2010 ("Original Sub-Advisory Agreement"), and no changes to that role are contemplated by the Proposal. No changes are contemplated to the investment sub-advisory services to be provided or the fees to be charged for those services, and all other terms and conditions of the new agreement are substantially identical to those of the original agreement. 
Original Sub-Advisory Agreement 
The Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act") is the principal statute regulating the operations of mutual funds like the Praxis International Index Fund. In accordance with the 1940 Act, investment sub-advisory services are permitted to be provided to a mutual fund only if they are provided in accordance with the terms of a written contract that meets certain formal requirements, including that: (i) the agreement is approved by the vote of a majority of the fund's outstanding shares prior to its initial use, (ii) after the agreement's initial term of no more than two years, its continuation is approved at least annually by the fund's board of trustees, and (iii) the agreement provides, in substance, that it will terminate automatically upon its "assignment." A transaction that results in a change of control of an investment sub-adviser, like the one recently completed by the Sub-Adviser (as described below), constitutes an "assignment" that automatically terminates the investment sub-advisory agreement. 
Change of Control Transaction 
On August 7, 2018, the Sub-Adviser entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement whereby Aperio Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), a newly formed subsidiary of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. and Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund-A, L.P. (together with certain other investment funds formed from time-to-time to invest alongside such private funds, "GGCOF"), would acquire a majority of the Sub-Adviser's outstanding equity interests ("Transaction"). Golden Gate Private Equity, Inc., an SEC-registered investment adviser, serves as investment manager with respect to GGCOF. The Transaction closed on October 3, 2018, and resulted in a change of control of the Sub-Adviser, with GGCOF owning, on an indirect basis, a majority interest in the Sub-Adviser.
Because the closing of the Transaction resulted in a change of control of the Sub-Adviser, it caused the termination of the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement effective October 3, 2018.  Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement 
In anticipation of the closing of the Transaction, the Board of Trustees took steps to ensure that the Fund would continue to receive investment sub-advisory services of the same nature and quality as it had been receiving from the Sub-Adviser. At an in-person meeting on August 23-24, 2018, the Board of Trustees approved an interim investment sub-advisory agreement ("Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement"), which became effective immediately upon the closing of the Transaction on October 3, 2018. In accordance with applicable legal requirements, the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement has a maximum term of 150 days, which is intended to allow sufficient time for shareholders to approve a new, longer-term agreement. 
New Sub-Advisory Agreement 
At an in-person meeting on November 17, 2018, the Board of Trustees unanimously approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement. They also recommended that shareholders approve the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and authorized the officers of the Fund to take steps to seek to obtain shareholder approval (including preparing and sending this Proxy Statement and holding the Special Meeting). 
The sub-advisory fees payable under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are the same as the sub-advisory fees payable under the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement, and the other terms and conditions of the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are substantially identical to those of the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement. 
Under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will be obligated to continue to provide the same services, and be held to the same standard of care, as is provided for under the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement and the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement. For example, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees and the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser will assist the Adviser in providing a continuous investment program for the Fund, including investment research and management with respect to securities and investments and cash equivalents in the Fund (other than investments made at the direction of the Adviser in notes issued by organizations that use the note proceeds to fund community development programs by making below-market rate loans to approved community development organizations ("CDI Notes") and related equity index futures). The Sub-Adviser will provide services under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement in accordance with the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's current prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as in accordance with the provisions of the Fund's Declaration of Trust and By-laws. The services will be non-exclusive, so the Sub-Adviser will be permitted to furnish similar services to others so long as its services to the Fund under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are not impaired. The Sub-Adviser generally will not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with providing its services, except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Sub-Adviser in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under the agreement. A copy of the New Sub-Advisory Agreement is attached as Appendix A. 
If the New Sub-Advisory Agreement is approved by shareholders at the Special Meeting, it will become effective on January 29, 2019. The New Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that it will remain in force for an initial term of just under one year (ending on December 31, 2019) and that it will continue in effect from year to year thereafter, subject to annual approval by the Trustees, including by a majority of the Independent Trustees, in accordance with procedural requirements under the 1940 Act. 
Compensation to Sub-Adviser 
As noted above, the sub-advisory fees payable under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are the same as the sub-advisory fees payable under the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement and the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement.  
Under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will continue to receive a fee, computed daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of 0.15% of the Fund's average daily net assets up to and including $500 million and 0.13% of the Fund's average daily net assets over $500 million. This is the same fee schedule that is in effect under the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement and that was in effect under the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction. It reflects a reduction that was agreed to between the Adviser and Sub-Adviser, which went into effect on March 1, 2018. For purposes of these calculations, assets invested in CDI Notes and related equity index futures at the direction of the Adviser are excluded from the amount on which the Sub-Adviser is compensated. For services rendered during the 2017 calendar year pursuant to the Original Sub-Advisory   Agreement, the Sub-Adviser received fees from the Adviser totaling $455,258. For services rendered during the 2018 calendar year through November 30 (pursuant to the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement through October 3 and pursuant to the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement thereafter), the Sub-Adviser is expected to receive fees from the Adviser totaling approximately $396,914. The Fund made no material payments to the Sub-Adviser or to any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser during the most recently completed fiscal year. 
Differences Between the Sub-Advisory Agreements 
The Original Sub-Advisory Agreement was approved by the sole initial shareholder of the Fund and dated December 31, 2010. It was not subsequently submitted to Fund shareholders for approval because, until the occurrence of the Transaction, no events occurred after the Fund's launch requiring shareholder approval. The New Sub-Advisory Agreement, if approved by Fund shareholders, will be dated January 29, 2019. As noted above, the terms and conditions of the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are substantially identical to those of the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement, although there are several minor differences: (i) the effective dates are different; (ii) the initial term expiration dates are different; (iii) several of the whereas clauses, which provide historical context for the agreements, are different; (iv) the current name of the Fund is reflected in the New Sub-Advisory Agreement while its former name is reflected in the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement; (v) the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement stated that lists of affiliates of the Fund and the Adviser would need to be provided to the Sub-Adviser for compliance purposes, while the New Sub-Advisory Agreement acknowledges that those lists have been provided; (vi) the description of the current types of community development investment notes in which the Fund may invest is included in the New Sub-Advisory Agreement while a description of the original types of community development investment notes is included in the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement; (vii) the New Sub-Advisory Agreement refers to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") in a provision covering marketing materials about the Fund, while the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement uses FINRA's former name; (viii) the notice provision in the New Sub-Advisory Agreement contains the current contact information for each party; (ix) the New Sub-Advisory Agreement acknowledges that it may be signed in counterparts; and (x) while both agreements contain an identical provision requiring the Sub-Adviser to maintain a fidelity bond with a minimum level of $3 million, the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement included an exception allowing the Sub-Adviser to maintain a lower level of coverage for the first 60 days of the contract period; that exception expired on March 1, 2011, and is not included in the New Sub-Advisory Agreement. 
In contrast to the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and Original Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement contains an escrow provision required under the 1940 Act for these types of interim sub-advisory agreements. The compensation earned by the Sub-Adviser must be held in an interest-bearing escrow account with the Fund's custodian or another bank, payable upon approval of the Proposal. If the Proposal is not approved, the Sub-Adviser will be paid upon the expiration of the 150 day term, the lesser of its costs incurred in providing the services, plus interest, or the amount in the escrow account. 
Board Considerations 
At its November 16-17, 2018 in-person meeting, the Board of Trustees unanimously approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and recommended that it be furnished to shareholders for approval. In reaching their determinations, the Trustees considered information furnished to them throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information about the Transaction presented at the August 23-24, 2018 in-person Board meeting and information furnished in connection with the October 28, 2018 telephonic Board meeting and the November 16-17, 2018 in-person Board meeting called for the specific purpose of considering the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and other related matters. In determining to approve the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and to recommend shareholder approval of the agreement, the Trustees reviewed and evaluated all of this information and factors they believed, in light of legal advice furnished to them by independent legal counsel and through the exercise of their own business judgment, to be relevant and appropriate. The Board's determinations were not based on any single factor and each Trustee may have weighed certain factors differently. 
Factors that were considered by the Trustees include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by the  Sub-Adviser. The Board of Trustees noted that the terms of the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are substantially identical to the terms of the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement, with the exceptions noted above in the section titled "Differences Between the Sub-Advisory Agreements." The Board of Trustees considered the  nature, extent and quality of services the Sub-Adviser provides to the Fund. Among other things, the Board of Trustees considered the Sub-Adviser's experience in providing the investment strategy used by  the Fund and in serving as Sub-Adviser to the Fund, including the experience of senior personnel at the Sub-Adviser providing portfolio management and other services to  the Fund. In this regard, the Board of Trustees noted that the Sub-Adviser had indicated that it does  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     not expect the Transaction to cause any changes to the composition of the Fund's portfolio management team or to cause any changes to the investment process used by the Sub-Adviser to implement the Fund's investment strategy. The Board of Trustees considered the Sub-Adviser's compliance capabilities, its compliance record with  respect to the Fund, and the quality of communication among the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees considered the  Sub-Adviser's compliance with the Fund's investment objective and policies, as well as its implementation of the Fund's principal investment strategy. The Board of Trustees considered the Sub-Adviser's track record and experience providing portfolio management services to the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the Sub-Adviser's responsiveness in  addressing Board questions and requests. The Board of Trustees considered that the change of control of the Sub-Adviser resulting from the Transaction creates certain risks relating to the provision of sub-advisory services by the Sub-Adviser, and noted steps the Sub-Adviser indicated it was taking to mitigate those risks, including  steps to retain key personnel. The Board of Trustees also considered that the Sub-Adviser represented, at the August 23-24, 2018 Board meeting and again shortly in  advance of the November 16-17, 2018 Board meeting, that the Sub-Adviser does not anticipate any changes to the nature and quality of services presently being provided by  the Sub-Adviser to the Fund and the Adviser under the sub-advisory agreement that is currently in effect, and that the  Sub-Adviser believes it will continue to provide services of the nature and quality as it provided to the Fund since the inception of its sub-advisory relationship with  the Fund. Based on these and other considerations, the Board of Trustees concluded that, under the circumstances, it was generally satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the services that the  Sub-Adviser has provided under the Original Sub-Advisory Agreement and Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement and the services that the Sub-Adviser is expected to provide under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Investment performance of the Fund and the Sub-Adviser. The Board  of Trustees considered the Fund's investment performance in light of the Fund's objectives, strategies and risks, as disclosed in the Fund's current prospectus. The Board of Trustees reviewed historical performance information for the  Fund and considered the Fund's historical performance relative to its benchmark and peer group. For example, the Board of Trustees considered that the investment performance of the Fund was within the forecasted tracking error, relative to its  benchmark index, for the one-, three- and five-year periods ending September 30, 2018. The Board of Trustees evaluated Fund performance gross and net of fees. The Board of Trustees also considered the  extent to which the Fund's values-based and ESG screens impacted performance. Based on these and other considerations, the Board of Trustees concluded that the Fund's investment performance was generally in line with expectations.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fees. The Board of Trustees considered the sub-advisory fees  charged by the Sub-Adviser against certain comparative fee information provided by the Sub-Adviser. The Board of Trustees noted that the  Sub-Adviser had recently agreed to a rate reduction, which has been in effect since March 1, 2018, and that those lower rates will remain in effect under the New  Sub-Advisory Agreement. Based on these and other considerations, the Board of Trustees concluded that the fees to be paid to the Sub-Adviser for the services expected to  be furnished under the New Sub-Advisory Agreement are fair and reasonable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Costs of Services and Profitability of the Sub-Adviser. The Board  of Trustees considered the costs of the services provided by the Sub-Adviser and the profits estimated to be realized by the Sub-Adviser and its affiliates from their  relationship with the Fund. The Board of Trustees also considered the methodology used by the Sub-Adviser to estimate the profitability, including the Sub-Adviser's  assumptions and the basis for those assumptions. Based on these and other considerations, the Board of Trustees concluded that the profitability was reasonable in light of the competitiveness of the  sub-advisory fees and the services provided.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Benefits. The Board of Trustees considered the extent to which the  Sub-Adviser or its affiliates would derive other benefits, including soft dollar credits or other similar benefits, from the Sub-Adviser's relationship with the  Fund. The Board of Trustees noted that the Sub-Adviser does not generate soft dollar credits from Fund transactions. The Board of Trustees concluded that Sub-Adviser  does not appear to derive material benefits from its relationship with the Fund other than from the receipt of sub-advisory fees and potential benefits from its association with the Fund and the Adviser.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Extent to which economies of scale might be realized as the Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect these  economies of scale for the benefit of Fund shareholders. The Board of Trustees considered that fee schedule in the New Sub-Advisory Agreement currently incorporates breakpoints and that the effective fee  rate will decline if and when the next breakpoint is exceeded.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Costs Associated with the Special Meeting. The Board of Trustees considered that that the Sub-Adviser has agreed to bear the costs and expenses that would otherwise be incurred by the Fund with regard to preparing, filing and mailing this Proxy Statement and related materials, soliciting proxies and  holding the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
After carefully considering this matter, the Board of Trustees unanimously determined to approve the New Sub-Advisory Agreement and to recommend its approval to Fund shareholders. In the event that shareholders do not approve the New Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Trustees will consider other options, including, for example, liquidation of the Fund. 
The Board of Trustees unanimously recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the Proposal.

VOTING REQUIREMENTS 
Shareholders Entitled to Vote 
The Trustees have fixed the close of business on November 29, 2018 as the record date ("Record Date") for the Special Meeting. Shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to Notice of the Special Meeting and to vote on the Proposal and any other matter that properly comes before the Special Meeting. 
As of the Record Date there were 25,006,542.936 shares of the Fund outstanding. 
Quorum 
Quorum is the minimum percentage of shares that must be present at the Special Meeting, whether in-person or represented by proxy, to conduct business at the Special Meeting. Quorum varies based on the item being considered. Quorum for acting on the Proposal is 50% of the outstanding shares as of the Record Date. Quorum for acting on most other matters, if any, that might be considered at the Special Meeting is 331/3% of the outstanding shares as of the Record Date. Quorum for considering adjournments is the number of shares present.  Vote Required to Approve Proposal 
Approval of the Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund, as defined under the 1940 Act. In this context, that means 67% of the votes cast or 12,503,271.468 votes, whichever is less. 
How Votes will be Counted 
Each whole share of the Fund is entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to vote and each fractional share is entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. 
Shares may be voted in person or by proxy. All shareholders are invited to attend the Special Meeting in person. Even if you plan to attend in person, however, please vote in advance of the Special Meeting at your earliest convenience. That helps ensure a quorum is present, which could reduce costs by avoiding potential adjournments. If you plan to attend in person, please be sure to bring proof of ownership of your Fund shares and proper identification. 
A proxy, if properly executed, duly submitted and not revoked, will be voted in accordance with the specifications thereon. A proxy that is properly executed but has no voting instructions as to the Proposal will be voted for the Proposal. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will be counted as shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but not as votes cast, which will have the same effect as a vote against the Proposal. "Broker non-votes" are shares held by a broker or nominee for which an executed proxy is received by the Fund, but are not voted as to the Proposal because instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power. 
A shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its tabulation at the Special Meeting by: (i) filing with the Secretary of the Trust a written instrument revoking the proxy, (ii) submitting a proxy bearing a later date, or (iii) attending and voting at the Special Meeting. 
Adjournment of the Special Meeting 
The Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question of adjourning the Special Meeting to another date and time, whether or not a quorum is present, and the Special Meeting may be held as adjourned within a reasonable time after the date set for the original meeting without further notice. 
Method of Solicitation 
No proxy solicitor has been retained. The principal solicitation will be by mail. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by officers, employees or agents of the Fund by telephone, internet or in person at no cost to the Fund. 
Five Percent Owners of Fund Shares 
As of the Record Date, the following person(s) owned of record or were known by the International Fund to own beneficially 5% or more of the Fund's shares:

INVESTMENT SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT 
AGREEMENT made this 29th day of January, 2019, between Everence Capital Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), and Aperio Group, LLC (the "Sub-Adviser") 
WHEREAS, Praxis Mutual Funds (the "Trust") is registered as an open-end, management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"); and 
WHEREAS, Praxis International Index Fund (the "Fund") is a separate investment series of the Trust; and 
WHEREAS, the Adviser has been appointed investment adviser to the Fund; and 
WHEREAS, the Sub-Adviser has been appointed investment sub-adviser to the Fund and has served as investment sub-adviser to the Fund since December 31, 2010, initially pursuant to a written contract dated December 31, 2010 ("Original Agreement") and subsequently pursuant to an interim sub-advisory agreement dated October 3, 2018 ("Interim Agreement"), pursuant to which it currently serves as investment sub-adviser to the Fund; and 
WHEREAS, the Interim Agreement will terminate on or before March 2, 2019; and 
WHEREAS, the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser are each duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as investment advisers and their respective registrations are current and in good order; and 
WHEREAS, the Adviser desires to retain the Sub-Adviser to assist it in the provision of a continuous investment program for the Fund; and 
WHEREAS, the Sub-Adviser is willing to furnish such services upon terms and conditions herein set forth; 
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board") and the Fund's existing shareholder(s) have approved this Agreement in accordance with the 1940 Act; and 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the parties hereto as follows; 
1. Appointment. The Adviser hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to act as investment sub-adviser to the Fund. Intending to be legally bound, the Sub-Adviser accepts such appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth for the compensation herein provided. 
2. Sub-Advisory Services. Subject to the supervision of the Board and the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser shall assist the Adviser in providing a continuous investment program with respect to the Fund's portfolio, including investment research and management with respect to all securities and investments and cash equivalents in the Fund, except as otherwise provided in Section 6 herein. The Sub-Adviser may determine the securities and investments to be purchased, sold or retained by the Fund in accordance with the Adviser's stewardship investing guidelines. In cooperation with the Sub-Adviser, the Adviser will provide guidance regarding individual securities and/or sectors that shall not be purchased for the Fund and reserves the right to remove securities from the Fund that do not meet the Adviser's social screens. The Sub-Adviser may place orders directly with the issuer or any broker or dealer for such securities and investments. The Sub-Adviser will provide services under this Agreement in accordance with the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions as stated in the Fund's currently effective prospectus and statement of additional information, the Trust's Declaration of Trust and By-laws, each as amended from time to time, and resolutions of the Board applicable to the Fund, each as provided to the Sub-Adviser by the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser shall have authority to enter into and execute agreements on behalf of the Fund relating to the acquisition or disposition of investment assets and the execution of portfolio transactions pursuant to the Sub-Adviser's management of the Fund under this Agreement. Such agreements may include foreign exchange contracts and other transactional agreements. Nothing contained herein, however, shall be deemed to authorize the Sub-Adviser to take or receive physical possession of any cash or securities held in the Fund, it being intended that sole responsibility for safekeeping thereof (in such investments as the Sub-Adviser shall direct) and the consummation of all such purchases, sales, deliveries, and investments made pursuant to the Sub-Adviser's direction shall rest upon the custodian for the Fund. The parties hereto also agree that the Sub-Adviser shall not receive or vote proxies or other similar solicitations on behalf of the Fund and that such proxies and other similar solicitations shall be voted by the Adviser in accordance with its procedures. The Sub-Adviser warrants that all actions taken in the exercise of the power herein granted to the Sub-Adviser will be taken solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Fund. 
A-1 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser further agrees that it: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  will use the same skill and care in providing such services as it uses in providing services to fiduciary  accounts for which it has investment responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  B.  will conform with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1940 Act and in addition  will conduct its activities under this Agreement in accordance with any applicable regulations of any governmental authority pertaining to the investment advisory activities of the Sub-Adviser;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  C.  will place or cause to be placed orders for the Fund either directly with the issuer or with any broker or  dealer.

Consistent with this obligation and to  the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, when the execution and price offered by two or more brokers or dealers are comparable, the Sub-Adviser may, in its discretion, purchase and sell portfolio securities to  and from brokers and dealers who provide the Sub-Adviser with research advice and other services. In no instance will portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to the Trust's principal underwriter,  the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or any affiliated person of the Trust, the Trust's principal underwriter, the Sub-Adviser or the Adviser, except to the extent  permitted by the 1940 Act and the Commission. The Adviser shall provide to the Sub-Adviser a list of each affiliate of the Adviser and the Trust immediately upon entering into this Agreement, or shall have  provided such list prior to entry into this Agreement, and shall notify the Sub-Adviser immediately in writing in the event of any changes to such list. Any action taken for the purpose of this Agreement by  the Adviser and/or the Fund, at the discretion of either or both, with regard to the placement of securities transactions shall be the Adviser's and the Fund's sole liability and responsibility, including the performance of any broker.   
[END TABLE]
The Sub-Adviser may use one or more of its affiliated persons, or other parties related to the Sub-Adviser, as brokers for effecting securities transactions for the Fund, and pay, on behalf of the Fund, fair and reasonable brokerage commissions therefor, but only in accordance with procedures adopted by the Fund pursuant to Rule 17e-l; 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  D.  will maintain or cause to be maintained all books and records with respect to the securities transactions of  the Fund and will furnish the Board with such periodic and special reports as the Board may request and allow for inspection of said books and records upon reasonable request;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  E.  will treat confidentially and as proprietary information of the Trust all records and other information  relative to the Trust and the Fund and prior, present, or potential shareholders, and will not use such records and information for any purpose other than performance of its responsibilities and duties hereunder, or as required by applicable law,  except after prior notification to and approval in writing by the Trust, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld and may not be withheld where the Sub-Adviser may be exposed to civil and criminal  contempt proceedings for failure to comply, when requested to divulge such information by duly constituted authorities, or when so requested by the Trust;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  F.  will keep the Adviser informed of developments materially affecting the Fund and will, on the Sub-Adviser's own initiative and as reasonably requested by the Adviser, furnish to the Adviser from time to time whatever information the Adviser reasonably believes appropriate for this purpose;   
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  H.  will immediately notify the Adviser and the Trust in the event that the  Sub-Adviser: (i) becomes subject to a statutory disqualification that prevents the Sub-Adviser from serving as an investment adviser pursuant to this Agreement; or  (ii) is or expects to become the subject of an administrative proceeding or enforcement action by the Commission or other regulatory authority;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  I.  will immediately forward to the Adviser, upon receipt, any correspondence from the Commission or other  regulatory authority that relates to the Fund;  
[END TABLE]
A-2 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  J.  will cause the Fund to comply with the requirements of (i) Section 85l(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") regarding derivation of income from specified investment activities, and (ii) Section 851(h)(4) of the Code regarding diversification of the Fund's assets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  K.  will maintain an appropriate compliance program to ensure that the services provided by the Sub-Adviser under this Agreement are performed in a manner consistent with the applicable laws and the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to Rule 38a-1 under  the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser agrees to provide such reports and certifications regarding its compliance program as the Adviser or the Trust shall reasonably request from time to time; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  L.  will maintain a written Code of Ethics that complies with the requirements of Rule 17j-l under the 1940 Act. The Sub-Adviser certifies that it has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent its "access persons," as such term is defined in  Rule 17j-l, from violating the Code of Ethics. The Sub-Adviser shall notify the Board upon the adoption of any material change to its Code of Ethics so that the Board,  including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, may approve such change not later than six months after its adoption by the Sub-Adviser, as required by Rule 17j-l. The Sub-Adviser also shall provide the Trust with a copy of any amendments to its Code of Ethics that do not represent a material change to such Code. Within 45 days of  the end of each calendar year while this Agreement is in effect (or more frequently if required by Rule l7j-l or as the Trust may reasonably request), the Sub-Adviser  shall provide the Board with a written report that, as required by Rule 17j-1: (i) describes any issue arising under the Sub-Adviser's Code of Ethics or related  procedures since the last report to the Board, including, but not limited to, information about material violations of the Code or related procedures and sanctions imposed in response to material violations, and (ii) certifies that the Sub-Adviser has adopted procedures reasonably necessary to prevent its access persons from violating its Code of Ethics. Upon the written request of the Trust, the Sub-Adviser  shall permit the Trust to examine the reports to be made by the Sub-Adviser under Rule 17j-l(d) and the records the Sub-Adviser  maintains pursuant to Rule l7j-1(f).  
[END TABLE]
3. Services Generally Not Exclusive. Except as provided herein, the services furnished by the Sub-Adviser hereunder are deemed not to be exclusive, and the Sub-Adviser shall be free to furnish similar services to others so long as it services under this Agreement are not impaired thereby. The Sub-Adviser and its affiliates may give advice and take action in the performance of their duties with respect to any of their clients which may differ from advice given, or the timing or nature of action taken, with respect to the Fund. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to impose upon the Sub-Adviser any obligation to purchase or sell or to recommend for purchase or sale for the Fund any security or other property which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates may purchase or sell for their own account or for the account of any other client, if in the Sub-Adviser's sole discretion, such action or such recommendation is undesirable or impractical for the Fund. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates from trading for their own account. The Sub-Adviser and its affiliates or other clients may have or trade in investments which are at the same time being traded for the Fund. The Sub-Adviser shall have no obligation to acquire for the Fund a position which the Sub-Adviser or its affiliates may acquire for their own or the account of another client, so long as it continues to be the policy and practice of the Sub-Adviser not to favor or disfavor any client or class of clients in the allocation of investment opportunities. 
4. Books and Records. In compliance with the requirements of Rule 3la-3 under the l940 Act, the Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records which it maintains for the Trust are the property of the Trust and further agrees to surrender promptly to the Trust any of such records upon the Trust's request. The Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to be maintained by Rule 31a-l under the 1940 Act. 
5. Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this Agreement other than the cost of securities, commodities and other investments (including brokerage commissions and other transaction charges, if any) purchased for the Fund. 
6. Compensation. For the services provided and the expenses assumed with respect to the Fund pursuant to this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will be entitled to a fee, computed daily and payable monthly, calculated at the annual rate of 0.15% of the Fund's average daily net assets up to and including $500 million, and 0.13% of the Fund's average daily net assets over $500 million. The total annual minimum compensation will not be less than $100,000. 
A-3 
For purposes of calculating the fee payable to the Sub-Adviser, "average daily net assets" will exclude those corporate notes issued by organizations that use the note proceeds to fund community development programs by making below-market rate loans to approved community development organizations purchased by the Fund at the direction of the Adviser from time to time ("CDI Notes"), and any and all equity index futures purchased by the Fund at the direction of the Adviser in consideration of the CDI Notes (together, the "Excluded Assets"). The Sub-Adviser does not assume responsibility or liability for managing the Excluded Assets. 
7. Limitation of Liability. The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except a loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services or a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the Sub-Adviser in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this Agreement. The federal and state securities laws impose liabilities under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith, and therefore nothing herein shall in any way constitute waiver or limitation of any rights which the undersigned may have under any federal and state securities laws. 
8. Duration and Termination. Unless sooner terminated, this Agreement shall continue through December 31, 2019, and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods, provided such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the Board or vote of the lesser of (i) 67% of the shares of the Fund represented at a meeting if holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund, provided that in either event its continuance also is approved by a majority of the Trust's Trustees who are not "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of any party to this Agreement (the "Independent Trustees"), by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. This Agreement is terminable without penalty, on 60 days' notice by the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser, or without penalty at any time by the Board or by vote of the lesser of (i) 67% of the shares of the Fund represented at a meeting if holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.
