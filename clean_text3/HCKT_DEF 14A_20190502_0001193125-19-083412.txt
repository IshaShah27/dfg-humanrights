PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
MAY 2, 2019 
SOLICITATION, VOTING AND REVOCABILITY OF PROXIES 
This proxy statement and the accompanying notice of annual meeting and proxy card are being made available, on or about March 22, 2019, to the shareholders of The Hackett Group, Inc. (the "Company"), in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 2, 2019 at 11 a.m. (local time) at The Ritz-Carlton Resorts of Naples 280 Vanderbilt Beach Road, Naples, Florida in the Estuary 2 meeting room and any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
Your shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained on a properly executed proxy card submitted to the Company or in accordance with your instructions submitted via the telephone or Internet. 
The Board recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the Board's nominees for directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" Proposal 2 to approve, in an advisory vote, the Company's executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" Proposal 3 to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the  fiscal year ending December 27, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Executed but unmarked proxies submitted to the Company will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations. 
If any other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders. The Company is not aware of any such matters that are proposed to be presented at the annual meeting. 
On or about March 22, 2019, the Company is mailing to its shareholders a notice containing instructions on how to access this proxy statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report and to vote online. The notice also contains instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of your annual meeting materials, including the notice of annual meeting, proxy statement and proxy card. Shareholders receiving this document and accompanying proxy card and annual report via the Internet may submit their proxies by telephone or through the Internet as instructed in the notice delivered via U.S. mail. Shareholders receiving this document and accompanying proxy card via U.S. mail may submit a signed proxy card or they may submit their proxy by telephone or through the Internet as instructed on the proxy card. Telephone and Internet proxies must be used in conjunction with, and will be subject to, the information and terms contained on the proxy card. These procedures may not be available to shareholders that hold their shares through a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian. If your shares are held in this manner, please check your proxy card or contact your broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian to determine whether you will be able to vote by telephone or through the Internet. 
The cost of soliciting proxies in the form enclosed herewith will be borne entirely by the Company. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by directors, officers and regular employees of the Company, without extra remuneration, by personal interviews, telephone or otherwise. The Company will request persons, firms and corporations holding shares in their name or in the names of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, to send proxy materials to and obtain proxies from the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in doing so.  The securities that may be voted at the annual meeting consist of shares of the Company's common stock. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles its owner to one vote on each matter as to which a vote is taken at the annual meeting. The close of business on March 15, 2019 has been fixed by the Board as the record date (the "Record Date") for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On the Record Date, 29,857,044 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. The presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date is necessary to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Shares can be voted only if the shareholder is present in person or represented by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend in person, you are encouraged to sign and return the enclosed proxy card or vote by telephone or through the Internet as instructed on the proxy card or in the notice mailed to you. 
Assuming the presence of a quorum at the annual meeting, the following voting standards will apply to the various proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the absence of a contested election, pursuant to the majority voting provisions of our bylaws, the Board's nominees for directors will be  elected only if the votes cast for such nominees' election exceed the votes cast against such nominees' election. For more information regarding the majority voting provisions of the Bylaws, see "Proposal 1-Election of Directors" on page 3 of this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote is  required to approve the proposal on executive compensation in Proposal 2. Proposal 2 is an advisory vote, which means that it is not binding on the Company. However, the Compensation Committee of the Board will take into account the outcome of the  vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote is  required to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 27, 2019 in Proposal 3.  
[END TABLE]
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares that are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the annual meeting. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner votes on one proposal, but does not vote on another proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on the approval of Proposal 1. Because abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the shares present or represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" Proposals 2 and 3. Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the approval of Proposals 2 or 3. 
The presence of a shareholder at the annual meeting will not automatically revoke the shareholder's proxy. Shareholders may, however, revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by filing with the Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation, by delivering to the Company a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person. If you submitted your proxy by telephone or through the Internet, you may also revoke it by submitting a new proxy using the same procedures at a later date. The telephone and Internet voting facilities for shareholders of record will close at 1:00 a.m. Central Time on the day of the meeting. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF THE BOARD NOMINEES AND FOR THE APPROVAL OF PROPOSALS 2 AND 3.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
The Company's articles of incorporation provide that the Board shall consist of no fewer than five directors and no more than fifteen directors. The Company's bylaws provide that the number of directors, within such limits, shall be determined by resolution of the Board. The Board currently is composed of six directors. The Board is divided into three classes. One class is elected each year for a term of three years. 
Three directors will be elected at the annual meeting. The Board has nominated Ted A. Fernandez, Robert A. Rivero, and Alan T.G. Wix, each are existing directors, for the positions. If elected, Messrs. Fernandez, Rivero, and Wix will each serve a three-year term expiring at the annual meeting in 2022. You can find more information about Messrs. Fernandez, Rivero, and Wix below. 
Unless otherwise instructed on the proxy, it is the intention of the proxy holders to vote the shares represented by each properly executed proxy for the election of the nominees. The Board believes that the nominees will stand for election and will serve if elected. However, if any nominee fails to stand for election or is unable to accept election, proxies will be voted by the proxy holders for the election of such other person as the Board may recommend. 
In the absence of a contested election, pursuant to the majority voting provisions in our bylaws, the Board's nominees for director will be elected only if the votes cast for each such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against each such nominee's election. If the majority vote requirement applies and a nominee who currently is serving as a director is not re-elected, our bylaws provide that he or she must tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then consider such resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will decide whether to accept or reject any such tendered resignation within 90 days after certification of the election results and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale therefor. If the resignation is not accepted, the director will continue to serve until his or her successor is elected and qualified, until there is a decrease in the number of directors, or until the director's earlier resignation or removal. The majority voting provisions apply only to elections in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected. In the event of an election in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, nominees will be elected by a plurality vote. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF MESSRS. FERNANDEZ, RIVERO AND WIX AS DIRECTORS.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Board's nominees for election as directors and those directors who will continue to serve as such after the annual meeting.

Corporate Governance and Other Matters 
Board Composition 
The Board consists of six members, four of whom are considered "independent directors" under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"). The Company's independent directors are Richard N. Hamlin, John R. Harris, Robert A. Rivero and Alan T.G. Wix. The Board currently has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of the Board's standing committees is chaired by and consists entirely of independent directors. 
Leadership Structure 
The roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer have been unified since the Company was founded, and the Board believes that the unification of those roles remains appropriate for the Company at this time. The Board believes that its leadership structure both (1) demonstrates to its employees, clients and shareholders that the Company is under strong leadership with a single person setting the tone and having primary responsibility for managing its operations, and (2) provides an effective connection between management's role of identifying, assessing and managing risks and the Board's role of risk oversight. The Board believes that Mr. Fernandez has an in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges that the Company faces, and therefore that he is best positioned to develop agendas and highlight issues that ensure that the Board's time and attention are focused on the most critical matters impacting the Company. The Board has not appointed a "lead" director. The Board believes that its current structure with four of its six members being independent and with each of its standing committees being chaired by and consisting entirely of independent directors, provides effective independent director oversight of the Company's operations. The Board recognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for companies in different situations and understands that no structure is appropriate for all companies. While the Board intends to review the appropriate leadership structure for the Company from time to time, the Board believes that the Company has been, and continues to be, well-served by its current leadership structure. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's management of the significant risks facing the business, including properly safeguarding the Company's assets, maintaining appropriate financial and other internal controls, complying with applicable laws and regulations, and implementing proper corporate governance practices. Risks are considered in all business decisions and in connection with the development of the Company's business strategy. The Board as a whole is responsible for reviewing and approving the Company's annual operating plan. In connection with that review, the Board typically inquires as to the greatest areas of risk associated with the annual operating plan and the Company's operating model taken as a whole and evaluates whether these risks are appropriately mitigated. 
In addition, the Board's committees, which meet regularly and report back to the Board, play significant roles in carrying out the Board's risk oversight function. Company management also plays an important role in connection with risk management through the implementation and evaluation of effective internal controls and other internal processes. 
The Board delegates to the Audit Committee responsibility for assisting the Board with several risk oversight functions, including oversight of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality and integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its financial reporting and disclosure practices;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's systems of internal controls regarding finance and accounting compliance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's ethical compliance programs.  
[END TABLE]
The Board delegates to the Compensation Committee responsibility for assisting the Board in the oversight of risks related to the Company's compensation programs. The Compensation Committee is charged with understanding the risks and rewards associated with the Company's compensation philosophy and ensuring that its various compensation programs are aligned with the Company's goals and objectives. 
The Board delegates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee authority to develop and implement the Company's director nomination guidelines and to recommend nominees for election, ensuring that the Board contains the appropriate mix of experience, qualifications, attributes and skills necessary to effectively exercise its oversight function. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also is responsible for developing and implementing the Company's corporate governance guidelines. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee reviews, acts on, and reports to the Board with respect to various auditing and accounting matters. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, evaluation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent accountants. The primary functions of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board in its responsibility for oversight of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality and integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its financial reporting and disclosure practices;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's system of internal controls regarding finance and accounting compliance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's ethical compliance programs.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee performs all functions required of audit committees of public companies under applicable laws, rules and regulations and the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market. 
The current members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Hamlin (Chairman), Harris, Rivero and Wix. Rules adopted by the NASDAQ and the SEC impose strict independence requirements for members of audit committees. In addition to meeting the NASDAQ's tests for director independence, audit committee members must meet two further criteria set forth in the SEC's rules. Under the SEC's rules, first, an audit committee member is barred from accepting, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, other than in the member's capacity as a member of the board of directors and any board committee. Second, an audit committee member may not be an affiliated person of the issuer or any subsidiary of the issuer apart from his or her capacity as a member of the board and any board committee. Each member of the Company's Audit Committee meets these independence requirements, in addition to the independence criteria established by the NASDAQ. The Board has determined that Mr. Hamlin and Mr. Rivero are audit committee financial experts, as that term is defined under SEC rules. 
The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the charter can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/. For further information on the Audit Committee, see the "Report of the Audit Committee" on page 31 in this proxy statement.  Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of the Company's executive officers and approving compensation and human resource programs for the Company. The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of the Company's CEO. In addition, the Compensation Committee has the following authority and responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to approve the compensation of all executive officers other than the CEO with input from the CEO;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to review, approve and, when appropriate, recommend to the Board for approval, incentive compensation plans, equity-based plans, employment agreements  and any severance arrangements or plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to administer the Company's incentive compensation plans, equity-based plans and employee benefit plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to review the Company's incentive compensation arrangements to determine whether they encourage excessive risk-taking, and to review and discuss  at least annually the relationship between risk management policies and practices and compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to review director compensation for service on the Board and Board committees periodically and to recommend any changes to the Board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to periodically retain an outside consultant to review the Company's compensation programs.  
[END TABLE]
The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Harris (Chairman), Hamlin, Rivero and Wix. The Board has determined that the current members of its Compensation Committee satisfy all of the independence requirements of the NASDAQ's listing standards. 
On an annual basis, the Company completes a review of the policies and practices associated with all of its compensation programs, including its executive compensation programs. As part of this assessment, the Company considers it generally beneficial from a risk management standpoint that awards are heavily weighted towards annual profitability. Annual profitability is, in turn, based on the delivery of services for which fees are collected in a relatively short period of time which provides the Company with visibility into its financial results before the pay out of incentive awards. For 2018, the Company conducted, and the Compensation Committee reviewed, a risk assessment of its compensation programs and considered the extent to which its compensation policies and practices influence the behaviors of its executives and other employees with respect to taking business risks that could affect the Company. The Company believes that none of its compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
The Compensation Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the charter can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/. For further information on the Compensation Committee, see the "Compensation Committee Report" on page 11 in this proxy statement. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The current members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. Wix (Chairman), Hamlin, Harris and Rivero. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommending candidates for election or re-election to the Board.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects and must approve by at least a majority vote all candidates to stand for election as directors. Pursuant to the Company's bylaws, other candidates may also be   nominated by any shareholder, provided each such other nomination is submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the bylaws. For a discussion of the requirements for including information with respect to a shareholder's nominee in the Company's proxy statement, see "Shareholder Proposals for the Annual Meeting in 2020" on page 36 of this proxy statement. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for the development and implementation of the Company's corporate governance guidelines. The Company's corporate governance guidelines can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/. The corporate governance guidelines implemented by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee contain criteria that the Committee employs to identify and recommend candidates to the Board. These criteria include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal and professional integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the skills, business experience and industry knowledge useful in the oversight of the Company based on the perceived needs of the Company and the Board  at any given time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability and willingness to devote the required amount of time to the Company's affairs, including preparation for and attendance at Board and  committee meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• interest, capacity and willingness, in conjunction with the members of the Board, to serve the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to the extent considered appropriate by the Board, whether a director candidate may be considered to be a "financial expert" as defined in  relevant SEC rules; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• freedom from any personal or professional relationships that would adversely affect the ability to serve the best interests of the Company and its  shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
These qualities would be considered as they relate to any candidate, whether suggested by management or by one or more of the Company's shareholders. With regard to the identification of director nominees, the Committee and the Board have always taken an approach that neither favors nor disfavors any particular color, race, creed, gender or other component of a nominee's background such as skills and qualifications. The Board evaluates all candidates equally across all relevant factors and seeks members whose background, qualifications and skills will assist the Company in accomplishing its goals. 
The Company's corporate governance guidelines also contain stock ownership guidelines for the Company's CEO and the outside members of the Board. Pursuant to these guidelines, the Company's CEO is required to own a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal in value to six times his annual base salary. Mr. Fernandez's base salary for 2019 is $750,000. The Company's outside Board members are required to own a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal in value to three times their maximum annual cash compensation under the current Outside Director Compensation Program. For 2019, the maximum annual cash compensation is $40,000 for attendance at regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings. The Company's CEO and its outside Board members (except Mr. Rivero) currently satisfy these requirements. Mr. Rivero will have until February 19, 2021 to meet the required level of stock ownership. The Company's CEO and its outside Board members are required to purchase shares in the open market to satisfy these guidelines if necessary. Once the guidelines are achieved, neither the CEO nor any outside Board member will be considered to be out of compliance with these guidelines due to fluctuations in the Company's stock price. 
The Company's corporate governance guidelines also contain hedging restrictions that prohibit directors and officers of the Company from, directly or indirectly, engaging in hedging transactions with respect to securities of the Company. The Company's corporate governance guidelines also contain pledging restrictions that prohibit directors and officers of the Company from pledging securities of the Company as collateral for a loan or otherwise using securities of the Company to secure a debt (e.g., to secure a margin loan) without the prior written approval of the Audit Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the charter can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/.  Other Matters 
During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018, the Board, Audit Committee, Compensation Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees each held 5 meetings. During that period, no director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of all meetings of the Board and any committee on which he served. The Company's independent directors regularly meet as a group in executive session outside of the presence of management. 
The Company's shareholders may communicate with its Board members via written correspondence mailed to the Company's corporate headquarters at 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, 30th Floor, Miami, Florida 33131. 
As is the case with all regularly scheduled meetings of the Board and its committees, all of the Company's directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders in person. All of the Company's directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics that is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and complies with the requirements of Section 406(c) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Code of Conduct and Ethics reflects the Company's policy of dealing with all persons, including its customers, employees, investors, regulators and vendors, with honesty and integrity. A copy of the Company's Code of Conduct and Ethics can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee met with management to review and discuss the Compensation Discussion and Analysis below. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 28, 2018, and the Board has approved that recommendation. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Compensation Committee

Alan T.G. Wix  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Overview of Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
The Committee's objectives relating to compensation are to align the financial interests of its executives with those of its shareholders and to attract and retain highly qualified executives. The Company achieves these objectives by linking a substantial portion of each executive's compensation to the achievement of financial and operational objectives in the executive's particular business unit or the Company as a whole. The Compensation Committee has adopted a "pay-for-performance" compensation program for the Company's executive officers. The program rewards the achievement of annual pro-forma earnings per share goals which, if met, result in the payment of cash bonuses and the issuance of restricted stock units. The program also rewards the achievement of long-term business objectives based on the continued improvement of operating performance, earnings growth and share value appreciation by vesting the incentive equity earned based on the achievement of profitability targets over a subsequent minimum three-year period. This represents the long-term component of our executive compensation programs. This vesting period, during which the value of our common stock can rise or fall based on Company performance places a premium on the execution of the Company's long-term strategy and further aligns our executives' interests with those of our shareholders. The short-term and long-term components of the Company's compensation programs require the Company's executive officers to focus on the future growth and current profitability of the Company as well as on increasing shareholder value. 
The main goals of the Company's executive compensation programs are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to focus executives on critical business issues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to ensure that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with respect to the Company's financial performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to attract and retain executive talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to increase shareholder value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to provide significant incentive opportunities tied to the attainment of specific financial performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
In order to attract, retain, and commit top executives to the fulfillment of superior performance results, the executive compensation programs are designed to provide superior pay opportunities in exchange for superior performance. 
The Company believes that its compensation program supports its business strategies and directly links pay with performance results. The Company continues to observe what it believes to be its directly comparative pay market, which is other strategic consulting and business advisory organizations and professional services firms which are mostly of significantly greater size. 
In order to assure that executive compensation is both competitive and appropriate, the Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation periodically to determine whether any adjustments to specific compensation components should be implemented. In connection with this process, the Compensation Committee primarily considers the value of cash salary and incentive cash and stock compensation. These compensation components are even more meaningful since the Company does not contribute to any retirement programs in any form including defined benefit, defined contribution or supplemental retirement plans for its executives. 
The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews external market data on executive compensation in order to obtain a general understanding of current compensation practices. Prior to review and adjustment of executive management compensation for 2017, the Committee retained John Bloedorn, an independent compensation consultant formerly with Mercer who was involved with the development of the Company's   current executive compensation programs to gather relevant marketplace data on total compensation for similar executive positions. This data consisted of annual salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, and pay mix. Data was obtained from total compensation information of similarly sized publicly traded companies including a subset of the Company's historical peer group and the most recent Institutional Shareholder Services peer group. In addition to Mr. Bloedorn's analysis, the Board also considered the Company's direct competitor group which consists of primarily private and much larger consulting groups such as McKinsey, Bain, BCG and the consulting arms of PwC, Deloitte, E&Y and KPMG. In reviewing external data, the Company does not engage in direct benchmarking to establish compensation levels or make specific compensation decisions for several reasons. One such reason is that the Company has a unique structure, set of skill requirements and differs from many of the larger size surveyed companies. Also, many of the Company's peer competitors are either privately held or are consulting divisions of companies that are significantly larger than the Company, such as Bain, McKinsey, BCG, Accenture and the consulting groups of the Big Four accounting firms. These companies may not provide public data that can be used for comparative purposes. Instead, the Company reviews survey data to gain a better understanding of general compensation practices. In establishing executive compensation, the Committee takes into account a number of considerations, including individual and Company performance, experience, responsibilities, retention and the lack of a retirement benefits program. Periodic review of external market data is, however, considered to be a necessary point of reference. It is the Company's preference that performance rather than benchmarking data drive executive compensation. Mr. Bloedorn's overall conclusion confirmed the Committee's belief that 2017 compensation levels were appropriate for the Company. An independent compensation consultant was not engaged in connection with the Compensation Committee's approval of the 2019 executive compensation programs, but the Company continues to rely on the conclusions of Mr. Bloedorn to make executive compensation decisions. 
The Committee has determined that the consultants retained or consulted by the Committee and its advisers are independent and raise no conflict of interest concerns. Mr. Bloedorn does not provide any services to the Company other than those services for which it was retained by the Committee. See "Role of Consultants" below for additional information regarding the Compensation Committee's use of external consultants in connection with the Company's incentive compensation program. 
The Elements of Executive Compensation at the Company 
Overview 
The Company's executive compensation program applies to its three named executive officers, Messrs. Fernandez, Dungan, and Ramirez. This program rewards the Company's named executive officers for the achievement of exceptional operating results by providing significant incentive opportunities tied to the attainment of specific financial performance goals. The design of the program has been substantially consistent since it was created by the Compensation Committee in 2005 based on recommendations from Mercer, a nationally recognized executive compensation consulting firm. The program consists of base salaries and cash and equity incentive opportunities that the Company believes are market competitive for companies of similar size within its industry. Historically, the executive compensation program has consisted of two primary elements: (1) short-term compensation in the form of annual compensation, consisting of base salaries and employee benefits; and (2) long-term compensation in the form of incentive compensation, in the form of performance-based cash awards and equity incentive grants issued in the form of restricted stock units which, after being earned through the achievement of performance targets, then vest over a three-year period. 
Cash and equity bonuses are tied to the achievement of pro-forma diluted net earnings per share targets based on a Board-approved operating plan. Pro-forma diluted net earnings per share is defined as net income before income from discontinued operations, if applicable, and does not include restructuring costs or benefits, acquisition-related adjustments, non-cash stock compensation expense, including stock appreciation rights ("SARs") expense, the amortization of intangible assets and includes a long-term effective cash tax rate. Pro-forma diluted net earnings per share is based on weighted average common and common equivalent shares   outstanding. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains the right to exclude the impact of certain nonrecurring events from the pro-forma diluted net earnings per share calculation when, in the opinion of the Compensation Committee, inclusion would not accurately reflect the operating performance of the Company. The Company believes that pro-forma diluted net earnings per share is the best measure of true operating performance and therefore the most appropriate metric for determining incentive compensation. 
On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee evaluates and establishes the threshold and target achievement levels for the Company's incentive compensation program, which it refers to as "Commence," "Goal" and "Superior." If the Company's performance falls short of the established goals for business growth, then the bonus compensation paid in connection with the program is reduced or no bonuses are paid at all. Payouts are interpolated if results fall between performance levels and extrapolated for performance exceeding the Superior level. The Company believes the targets established for the executive team, including the named executive officers, are challenging. This program has been in effect for fourteen years. In two of those years, no bonuses were paid to its executive team as the Commence performance target was not achieved. In five of those years, over which average pro-forma earnings per share growth exceeded 9%, a prorated bonus was paid based on results which were between the Commence and the Goal targets. In two of those years, over which average pro-forma earnings per share growth exceeded 26%, the Goal target was achieved. In five of those years, over which average pro-forma earnings per share growth exceeded 133%, the Company's performance exceeded the Superior target. Excluding 2010, when pro-forma earnings per share growth was 476%, the average pro-forma earnings per share growth over the other four years in which Superior targets were achieved exceeded 47%. 
The Compensation Committee targets an even balance between the cash and equity award opportunities included in the programs, weighting the equity component more heavily in the case of its CEO and COO. A key feature of the equity grants for the named executive officers is that performance-based awards also vest one third per year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Performance-based grants issued to employees, other than the Company's named executive officers, vest over a three or four-year period, based on the recipient's individual compensation program. All restricted stock unit grants, other than those issued upon hiring, are issued based on the achievement of Company, practice or individual performance goals, or any combination thereof. Vesting is contingent on continued employment. The Company regards this vesting period as an important retention tool. More importantly, the Company believes that incentive compensation that is paid in the form of equity that vests over three years serves as a meaningful long-term incentive, the ultimate value of which is directly correlated to the price of the Company's common stock. This rewards employees for increasing shareholder value. A heavier weighting on the incentive equity component ties a greater portion of the Company's CEO and COO's ultimate compensation to the ability to deliver increased shareholder value over the vesting period. To further ensure the alignment of the CEO's interests with those of the Company's shareholders, the Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines that require the CEO to own a number of shares equal in value to six times his annual base salary. The CEO is currently in compliance with this guideline. 
Annual Compensation 
Annual compensation consists of base salaries and employee benefits. These elements are intended to provide a degree of compensation certainty to the named executive officers by providing compensation that, unlike incentive compensation, is not contingent on the achievement of performance criteria. 
Base Salaries 
The salaries payable to the Company's named executive officers are generally recommended to the Board by the Compensation Committee during the first quarter of each fiscal year. Each of the named executive officers is a party to an employment agreement that establishes a minimum salary level for the named executive officer. The employment agreements do not provide for any guaranteed increases to base salaries. Messrs. Fernandez, Dungan, and Ramirez's base salaries in 2018 were $750,000, $525,000 and $300,000 respectively. The CEO's base salary was last increased in 2005. The COO's last salary increase was in 2006.  The Company believes the base salaries it currently pays to its named executive officers are at market competitive levels for companies of similar size within its industry. See the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 19 of this proxy statement and the related footnotes for additional information about base salaries. 
Incentive Compensation 
The Company's annual incentive program reflects the Compensation Committee's belief that a significant portion of the named executive officers' compensation should be tied to company performance. For 2018, variable, non-guaranteed performance-based compensation paid to Messrs. Fernandez and Dungan represented 63% and 57%, respectively, of their total compensation. The annual incentive component of the Company's compensation program consists of annual performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity incentive grants in the form of restricted stock units that vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. These performance-based cash and equity opportunities are tied to the achievement of pro-forma diluted net earnings per share targets based on a Board-approved operating plan. Each participant in the Company's executive compensation program has target cash and equity incentive opportunities expressed as a percentage of salary. Cash and equity payouts are based on the dollar amount of the opportunity earned based on target levels achieved. For our CEO and COO the equity opportunities have historically been more heavily weighted than the cash opportunities, including 2018. Performance-based equity incentive awards earned expressed in a dollar amount are divided by the Company's share price on the date of grant to calculate the equity incentive grant in the form of restricted stock units, the value of which is ultimately determined by the Company's stock price on the date of vesting. 
Customary Employee Benefits 
The named executive officers, like the rest of the Company's employees, receive certain customary employee benefits. For 2018, these benefits included health, dental and vision coverage, prescription drug plans, life insurance, flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance and a 401(k) plan. The Company covers approximately 60% of the total cost of the health benefits for its U.S.-based employees, including its named executive officers. In other geographies, the Company's compensation and benefits packages vary by country and are based on market standards, local custom and legal requirements in the jurisdiction. The Company does not provide for any special retirement-related benefits, such as pensions or 401(k) contribution matches, for its senior executives. 
No Perquisites 
The Company does not provide any executive perquisites. 
Role of Consultants 
In 2017, the Committee retained John Bloedorn, an independent compensation consultant formerly with Mercer who was involved with the development of the Company's current executive compensation programs, to gather relevant marketplace data on total compensation for similar executive positions. This data consisted of annual salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, and pay mix. Data was obtained from total compensation information of similarly sized publicly traded companies, including a subset of the Company's peer group established by Institutional Shareholder Services. With respect to the 2017 review, the consultant did not perform any services on behalf of management and did not have any potential business conflicts that would affect its role as an independent advisor. An independent compensation consultant was not engaged in connection with the Compensation Committee's approval of the 2019 executive compensation programs which are unchanged from 2017 except for the "Commence", "Goal" and "Superior" target levels. See "Executive Compensation Decisions for 2019" on page 17 of this proxy statement. 
The Company continues to rely on the conclusions of Mr. Bloedorn to make executive compensation decisions.  Shareholder "Say on Pay" Vote 
In the "Say on Pay" vote provided by the Company at its 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders approved the compensation of the Company's executives as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the meeting, with approximately 82% of the votes cast in favor. The Compensation Committee considered the results of this vote in setting the compensation of the Company's named executive officers and decided to maintain the Company's current executive compensation programs for fiscal year 2019. 
Executive Compensation Decisions for 2018 
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee believes that the base salaries of the Company's named executive officers remain at market competitive levels for companies of similar size within the Company's industry. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee decided not to increase the named executive officers' base salaries in 2018, and their base salaries will remain unchanged for 2019 as well. 
Incentive Compensation 
Each participant in the Company's executive compensation program has cash and equity incentive opportunities expressed as a percentage of salary that are tied to specified performance targets. For 2018, variable compensation paid to Messrs. Fernandez, Dungan, and Ramirez in the form of cash and restricted stock units subject to a three-year vesting period represented 63%, 57%, and 39%, respectively, of their total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
At its meeting held on February 16, 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved base salaries and cash and equity incentive plan targets and opportunities for the named executive officers, as well as for the Company's other senior leaders. The Compensation Committee specifically approved a program for its named executive officers that would pay annual cash and equity bonuses in connection with the achievement of 2018 pro-forma diluted earnings per share performance targets. For 2018, the "Goal" and "Superior" targets established by the Compensation Committee were $1.15 and $1.23, respectively. These targets represented a 15% and 23% improvement over the Company's prior year actual pro-forma diluted net earnings per share results, respectively. Cash and equity incentive opportunities for our named executive officers for 2018 remained unchanged from 2017. 
2018 Performance Outcomes 
In 2018, the Company generated net revenue, pro-forma EBITDA and pro-forma net earnings per share from continuing operations of $264.5 million, $48.9 million and $1.06 per share, respectively. The Company had net revenue from continuing operations growth in 2018 of 4% with corresponding pro-forma EBITDA growth of 5% and pro-forma diluted net earnings per share growth of 12% from continuing operations. The Company excluded the loss associated with the discontinuance of the REL Working Capital practice which was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2018 from its 2018 pro-forma net earnings per share calculation since the inclusion of the impact would not accurately reflect the operating performance of the Company's continuing operations. For purposes of calculating 2018 cash and equity performance bonuses for the Company's Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee included the loss associated with the Company's REL Working Capital practice. This resulted in a pro-forma diluted earnings per of $1.03 which the Committee believed was the most appropriate metric for determining incentive compensation for 2018. In accordance with the targets established by the Compensation Committee, the pro-forma diluted net earnings per share utilized by the Compensation Committee resulted in the payment of 54% of the "Goal" level payout under the Company's 2018 executive compensation plan.  Executive Compensation Decisions for 2019 
At its meeting held on February 14, 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved 2019 base salaries and cash and equity incentive plan targets for the Company's named executive officers, as well as for the Company's other senior leaders. Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee specifically approved a program for its named executive officers that, in addition to base salaries, would pay annual cash and equity incentive bonuses in connection with the achievement of specified 2019 performance targets. The Compensation Committee chose to retain the pro-forma diluted net earnings per share as the performance target in the 2019 program. 
The Company's Compensation Committee has once again established challenging performance targets for 2019. The Company's pro-forma diluted net earnings per share must improve at least 10% from 2018 actual results in order for the named executive officers to earn their "Goal" cash and equity performance incentive awards. The Company's pro-forma diluted net earnings per share must improve at least 17% from 2018 actual results in order for the named executive officers to earn their "Superior" cash and equity performance incentive awards. 
Timing of Equity Incentive Plan Awards and Discretionary Equity Awards 
The Company does not have a program, plan or practice to time equity awards, including option grants, to its named executive officers or directors in coordination with the release of material non-public information. The Company consistently presents to its Compensation Committee for approval all year-end cash and equity bonus awards based on the previous year's results at the first Compensation Committee meeting of the year. However, the timing of this approval may be changed in the event of extraordinary circumstances. The Company's equity plan expressly prohibits the repricing of options and SARs. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations and Compensation Deductibility Policy 
In evaluating compensation program alternatives, the Compensation Committee considered the potential impact on the Company of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"), among other factors. Prior to January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) imposed a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the Company's chief executive officer and certain other executive officers ("covered employees"). Certain "performance-based" compensation paid to such covered employees was excluded from Section 162(m)'s limitation and was deductible if certain requirements were met. Under tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"), the deductibility of executive compensation was further limited, effective January 1, 2018. Section 162(m) still imposes a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the Company's chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. But, the exclusion for "performance-based" compensation was repealed, and the group of covered employees subject to the limitation was expanded to include the Company's chief financial officer and certain former executive officers. Under certain interim relief provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compensation awarded before November 3, 2017 may continue to be deductible in the future pursuant to the rules applicable prior to January 1, 2018. However, due to ambiguities and uncertainties about how the revised Section 162(m) and the interim relief provisions should apply, it is uncertain whether compensation that the Compensation Committee originally intended to be structured as "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m), or prior compensation awarded to the Company's chief financial officer, will be deductible going forward. 
As a general matter, in making its previous compensation decisions for the Company's covered employees, the Compensation Committee endeavored to maximize deductibility of compensation under Section 162(m) to the extent practicable under then-applicable law while maintaining competitive compensation. The Compensation Committee, however, believes that it is important for it to retain maximum flexibility in designing compensation programs that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, even if such approach   results in certain amounts that may be payable in excess of $1,000,000 to not be deductible under Section 162(m). As a result, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility in circumstances it deems appropriate to promote varying corporate goals. 
Compensation Recovery 
Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in the event of misconduct that results in a financial restatement that would have reduced a previously paid incentive amount, the Company can recoup, or "claw back," those improper payments from the CEO and CFO. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank") directed the SEC to craft new rules for recoupment in addition to that contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Notwithstanding the lack of final compensation recovery rules pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the Company adopted an Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy that allows for the recovery from its current or former named executive officers of any erroneously awarded compensation in the three-year period prior to a restatement. A copy of the Company's Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/.  SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE

Mr. Fernandez 
Mr. Fernandez entered into an employment agreement with the Company effective as of June 2, 1998. It was amended on November 10, 2004, June 10, 2005, December 30, 2008 and March 10, 2017. The agreement provides for a three-year term (with an automatic renewal for one additional year on each subsequent anniversary thereafter unless either party gives contrary notice) and currently provides for an annual salary and bonus to be determined and paid pursuant to a bonus plan to be adopted by the Board for each fiscal year. The agreement also contains certain confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation provisions. Mr. Fernandez's employment agreement also includes the following provisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• upon termination by the Company without cause, or upon termination by Mr. Fernandez for "good reason," Mr. Fernandez will receive  one year's annual salary and bonus paid in lump sum and full vesting of all issued and outstanding equity grants;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• upon a change of control, upon termination, Mr. Fernandez will receive two hundred percent of his annual salary and bonus paid in a lump sum and  full vesting of all unvested issued and outstanding equity grants upon termination.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Director Compensation for 2018 
Directors who are officers or employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board or any of its committees. Each outside director receives an annual $40,000 cash retainer, paid quarterly. All directors are reimbursed for travel expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and committee meetings. 
The Company's outside directors also receive an annual restricted stock unit grant equal in value to $72,000 on the date of grant. All restricted stock units granted under this program will vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and will also vest upon involuntary termination of service, including change of control. Upon reaching ten years of service on the Board, outside director members receive a restricted stock unit grant equal in number of units to his or her annual service grant for that year. Beginning with grants that occurred in 2012, each of the Company's outside directors is allowed to elect to defer the receipt of their shares upon vesting for three years, five years or until death, disability or termination of service on the Board.

 Compensation Committee Interlocks 
The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Harris (Chairman), Hamlin, Rivero and Wix. No current or former member of the Compensation Committee is, or has ever been, an officer or employee of the Company. None of the Company's directors and none of their family members are employed as an executive of another company where any of the Company's executives serve on the compensation committee of which the director is an executive. 
PAY RATIO 
Presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
In identifying our median employee, our calculation included the base salary for each employee as of December 28, 2018, commissions paid in 2018 and any cash and equity performance-based bonus compensation paid or granted, respectively, to such employees in 2019 based on their performance for fiscal year 2018. Bonus information for 2018 was not available for all employees as of the Record Date as several of our practices conduct performance reviews during the first quarter of the year and approve raises and pay bonuses in April. For employees in these practices we estimated 2018 cash and equity bonuses based on 2017 payouts which we believe will be reasonably comparable to 2018. The amount included for equity performance-based bonus compensation grants equaled the fair market value of the shares underlying such grant as of the grant date, however, these grants are subject to time vesting which requires continued employment of the grantee for a period of time ranging from three to four years. Cash compensation for these purposes included base salary or wages plus overtime pay, cash bonuses, cash commissions and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions, if applicable, and was calculated using internal payroll and/or tax records. Salaries or wages paid in non-U.S. jurisdictions were converted to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as of December 28, 2018. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. 
We selected the median employee based on 1,187 full-time and part-time workers who were employed as of December 28, 2018. 
The fiscal year 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our CEO was $2,054,910. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our median employee was $120,000. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 17 to 1. 
We have employees in countries with differing labor market characteristics. As such, for purposes of comparability we have also calculated the annual total compensation for our median employee in the United States where we have 698 employees and generate the majority of our revenue and profitability. The annual total compensation for the median U.S. based employee is $160,813. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median U.S. based employee's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 13 to 1.  PROPOSAL 2 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Company is providing its shareholders an opportunity to indicate whether they support the named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" vote, is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but instead relates to the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the tabular disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation, and the narrative disclosures accompanying the tabular presentation. These disclosures allow you to view the Company's executive compensation program and the application of the Company's compensation philosophies for the years presented. This advisory vote will be presented on an annual basis unless otherwise disclosed. 
The Company's primary objectives relating to executive compensation are to (1) align the financial interests of its executives with those of its shareholders by linking a substantial portion of each executive's compensation to the achievement of financial objectives for the Company as a whole and (2) attract and retain highly qualified executives with salaries and incentive programs that are competitive with companies of similar or greater size within its industry. 
The Company's executive compensation programs, which focus on operating performance, earnings growth and share price appreciation, reflect the Company's "pay for performance" approach to compensation. Annually, our executives have the opportunity to earn cash payouts and equity awards based on the achievement of pro-forma diluted net earnings per share growth targets specified by the Company's Compensation Committee. Another key aspect of the executive compensation programs is that a meaningful part of total compensation is paid with performance-based restricted stock unit grants that not only requires the achievement of a performance-based target to earn the grant, but also has a three-year vesting period following the date of grant. The vesting requirement of the equity portion of the compensation program (1) extends the value of current year compensation program for an additional three-year period, (2) creates a strong incentive for the executives to increase shareholder value, and (3) serves as a powerful executive retention tool. This equity component is also essential to the compensation and retention of the Company's executives since the Company does not provide retirement (pension or 401(k) match) benefits for its senior executives and offers no perquisites. Finally, our CEO and COO are significant shareholders which continues to provide an incentive for the CEO and COO to focus on share value appreciation in order to maximize the benefit of the vested awards. 
In 2018, the Company generated net revenue, pro-forma EBITDA and pro-forma net earnings per share from continuing operations of $264.5 million, $48.9 million and $1.06 per share, respectively. The Company had net revenue from continuing operations growth in 2018 of 4% with corresponding pro-forma EBITDA growth of 5% and pro-forma diluted net earnings per share growth of 12% from continuing operations. The Company excluded the loss associated with the discontinuance of the REL Working Capital practice which was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2018 from its 2018 pro-forma net earnings per share calculation since the inclusion of the impact would not accurately reflect the operating performance of the Company's continuing operations. For purposes of calculating 2018 cash and equity performance bonuses for the Company's Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee included the loss associated with the Company's REL working capital practice. This resulted in a pro-forma diluted earnings per share of $1.03 which the Committee believed was the most appropriate metric for determining incentive compensation for 2018. In accordance with the targets established by the Compensation Committee, the pro-forma diluted net earnings per share utilized by the Compensation Committee resulted in the payment of 54% of the "Goal" level payout under the Company's 2018 executive compensation plan. 
The Company's Compensation Committee has once again established challenging performance targets for 2019. The Company's pro-forma diluted net earnings per share must improve at least 10% from 2018 actual results in order for the named executive officers to earn their "Goal" cash and equity performance incentive awards. The Company's pro-forma diluted net earnings per share must improve at least 17% from 2018 actual   results in order for the named executive officers to earn their "Superior" cash and equity performance-based incentive awards. 
See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 12 of this proxy statement for more information regarding aspects of the Company's executive compensation programs and the Compensation Committee's decisions in respect of executive compensation in 2018. See also "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Plan-Based Awards Table" beginning on page 23 of this proxy statement for more information regarding the terms contained in the employment agreements of our Named Executive Officers. 
For the reasons discussed in this proxy statement, including under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above, the Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related footnotes and narrative disclosures." 
Although this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required to approve the proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 2: 
APPROVAL OF THE RESOLUTION APPROVING THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee of the Board currently consists of Messrs. Hamlin (Chairman), Harris, Rivero and Wix. The Audit Committee is composed of "independent" directors as defined in standards promulgated by the SEC and the NASDAQ. The Board determined that Messrs. Hamlin and Rivero are audit committee financial experts under the SEC rules. The Company's Audit Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter can be found on the Company's website at https://www.thehackettgroup.com/about/governance/. All members of the Audit Committee share equally the responsibility for the performance of the functions set forth below. 
The Audit Committee reviewed with RSM US LLP ("RSM") all matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees (AS 1301)", as modified or supplemented. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with RSM its independence from management and the Company, and it received the written disclosures and letter from RSM as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding RSM's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with RSM the overall scope and plans for the Company's audit. The Audit Committee meets with RSM, without management present when appropriate, to discuss the results of their quarterly reviews and annual examination, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee held 5 meetings during fiscal 2018. 
The Audit Committee approved all audit and non-audit services provided by RSM in fiscal 2018, as described in "Pre-Approval of Non-Audit Services" below. 
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal control over financial reporting. In performing its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018 with management and with representatives of RSM. The Audit Committee also reviewed, and discussed with management and representatives of RSM, management's assessment and report and RSM's assessment and report and attestation on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board approved) inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018, filed with the SEC. 
Pre-Approval of Non-Audit Services 
All audit-related services, tax services and other services were approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by RSM was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit Committee's Policy for Pre-Approval of Non-Audit Services provides for pre-approval of audit-related, tax and other services specifically described by the Audit Committee in the policy on an annual basis. In addition, individual engagements anticipated to exceed pre-established thresholds must be separately approved. If the entire Audit Committee is not able to convene so that permitted non-audit services desired to be performed by the Company's independent auditors can be reviewed and approved on a timely basis, the Audit Committee Chairman is authorized to approve such services and make a verbal report to the full Audit Committee as to the nature and cost of such services at the next Audit Committee meeting following such approval. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Audit Committee 
Richard N. Hamlin, Chairman 
John R. Harris 
Robert A. Rivero 
Alan T.G. Wix  PROPOSAL 3 
TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF RSM US LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 27, 2019 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed RSM US LLP ("RSM") as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 27, 2019. During fiscal year 2018, RSM served as the Company's independent registered certified public accounting firm and also provided other audit-related services. See "Fees Paid to Independent Accountants" below. 
The appointment of RSM is being presented to the shareholders for ratification. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee of the Board will consider whether it should select a different independent registered public accounting firm. The Company's bylaws do not require that the shareholders ratify the appointment of RSM as its independent auditors. This proposal is being submitted to the shareholders because the Company believes it is a matter of good corporate practice. The Company expects that representatives of RSM will be present at the annual meeting. They will be given an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and it is expected that they will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Fees Paid to Independent Accountants 
The following table sets forth fees for professional services provided by RSM and associated entities, including RMS International entities for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 and fees billed for audit-related services, tax services, and all other services rendered by RSM for fiscal years 2018 and 2017:
