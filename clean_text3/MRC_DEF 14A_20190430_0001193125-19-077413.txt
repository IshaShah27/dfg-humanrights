A Message from our Chairman Rhys J. Best 
March 18, 2019 
Dear Fellow Stockholder: 
We are pleased to invite you to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders which will be held on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at the Fulbright Tower Auditorium, 1301 McKinney Street, Houston, Texas 77010, at 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time. A notice of the meeting and a Proxy Statement containing information about the matters to be acted upon are attached to this letter. 
Your vote is important to us. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please promptly vote your shares by submitting your proxy by internet or telephone or by completing, signing, dating and returning your Proxy Card or voting instruction form. If you decide to attend the Annual Meeting, you will be able to vote in person, even if you have previously submitted your proxy. 
Thank you for being a stockholder and for the trust and continued interest you have in MRC Global Inc. 
Best regards, 
/s/ Rhys J. Best 
Rhys J. Best 
Chairman of the Board 
Dear Fellow MRC Global Shareholders, 
In the energy sector, while operating companies aim to achieve high returns and invest billions of dollars annually, the service and equipment sector play a key role in supporting operators to achieve their goals through product supply and logistics support. We are not wholly immune from the energy sector's cyclicality, but by being a provider to the energy sector across its upstream, midstream and downstream segments, we believe we are positioned for strong and sustainable returns. We also invest to make this true. 
In 2018, gross profit of 16.5% of sales and our adjusted gross profit of 19.6% of sales was the highest since 2008. (See the footnote on page 5 regarding the non-GAAP measure, adjusted gross profit.) Our revenue increased 14% over 2017 and 37% since 2016. 
As importantly, we worked hard during the downturn to build and open our new state-of-the-art Houston Operations Complex, the largest facility in our network. This complex supports our ability to be a leader in engineering, distribution, logistics and customer service in the 22 countries in which we operate, including enabling customers globally to order any of our products online. Our e-commerce business, which we believe will enhance our profitability in the future, continues to grow. 
While many sectors of the US economy steadily eliminate benefits-paying and stable jobs, we continue to invest in our human capital as well as our physical, technological, intellectual and reputational capital. The vast majority of our full time employees have access to medical, dental, vision, wellness, retirement savings, education, and training programs. Further, while often overlooked, the tax revenues we generate support our communities more generally: a recent study documented that the energy sector alone generates over $30 million a day in tax revenues, just in Texas. 
On the environmental front, our products and processes help our customers manage their environmental risks every day, as our products contain and, therefore, prevent the unintended release of hydrocarbons and chemicals into the environment. 
Finally, our governance and compensation provisions include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a diverse board with minority, female, and significant shareholder members,  
• a separate chair and CEO,  
• an annual incentive based entirely on key financial measures that require meaningful growth for target payout,   
• tying a portion of equity to long-term return metrics with stretch goals, and  
• a CEO to median employee pay ratio of 79:1.  
[END TABLE]
We invite you to read about our MRC Global Core Values on page 3 of this proxy statement and review our inaugural Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance Report referenced on that page. 
We ask for your voting support on the items described in this proxy statement and thank you for your investment in us. 
Sincerely, 
/s/ Andrew R. Lane

President and Chief Executive Officer

Our Commitment to Environmental, Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance 
In November 2018, MRC Global published its inaugural 2018 Environmental, Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance Report ("ESG Report"), which provides highlights of our environmental and social policies and practices. The report can be found on our website at https://www.mrcglobal.com, by clicking on "Company" and "Corporate Social Responsibility".

We integrate environmental and social policies and practices into our daily operations by delivering value to our customers, building strong communities, leveraging innovative supply solutions to enhance our customers' operations and operating with integrity and responsibility in all respects of our operations and supporting our employees. We derive this focus from our core values of safety leadership, customer satisfaction, employee development, operational excellence, community and charity development, financial performance and teamwork.

+  Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted gross  profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, and plus or minus the impact of our last-in, first-out  ("LIFO") inventory costing methodology. We present adjusted gross profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, that can vary substantially  from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect to utilize  LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect. We use adjusted gross profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to adjusted gross profit. See pages 30-32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018  that has been filed with the SEC for a more detailed reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit.

++  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, and we define adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes,  depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses, (such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of  derivative instruments and asset impairments, including inventory) and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We believe adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with  the performance of other companies that may have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, which can vary  substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon whether they elect  to utilize LIFO and depending upon which method they may elect.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
MRC Global's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain our executives, including our named executive officers (NEOs"), who are critical to the Company's long-term success. Our compensation program is based upon and is designed to address three core principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Executive  officer goals are linked with stockholder interests       The Company's compensation  policies are designed to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.

   Executive  officer goals are linked with stockholder interests       The Company's compensation  policies are designed to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.   
 Compensation is significantly performance-based       We provide executive compensation  from a total direct compensation perspective. This consists of fixed and variable pay, with an emphasis on variable pay to reward short-term performance measured against pre-established operational goals and  objectives and long-term pay in the form of restricted stock units and performance share units. Restricted stock unit values increase or decrease with share price. Vesting of performance share units depends on relative shareholder value compared to  companies in the OSX index (described on page 34) and achievement of RANCE targets (described on page 34).

   Compensation opportunities are competitive to attract and  retain talented employees         Each year, the Compensation Committee of our Board assesses the  competitiveness of total compensation levels for executives to enable the Company to successfully attract and retain executive talent.

[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, is responsible for oversight of our executive compensation program and determines the compensation to be paid to our executive officers (other than our CEO). With respect to our CEO, the Compensation Committee makes recommendations to our full Board regarding CEO compensation, and the full Board determines CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee makes decisions on executive compensation from a total direct compensation perspective. Total direct compensation is comprised of base salary, annual cash incentive, long-term incentive compensation, benefits and perquisites. A substantial portion of our executives' compensation is performance-based and at-risk. In addition, our compensation program has a significant component of long-term equity awards rather than cash compensation. We believe this maximizes retention and aligns a substantial portion of our named executive officers' compensation directly with stockholders' interests. 
2018 Target Compensation 
The following illustration represents the elements of target compensation for our NEOs in 2018. 
CEO Annual cash incentive for each performance metric does not pay out unless threshold performance for that metric is achieved. Performance share units pay out based on relative total shareholder return, when compared to companies in the OSX index, and achievement of a RANCE target. Value of restricted stock units is aligned with Company share price. Average for Other Named Executives

PROXY STATEMENT 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
We are furnishing this Proxy Statement to you as part of a solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of MRC Global Inc., a Delaware corporation, for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and at any reconvened meeting after an adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. We will hold the Annual Meeting at the Fulbright Tower Auditorium, 1301 McKinney Street, Houston, Texas 77010 on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. Houston, Texas time. When used in this Proxy Statement, references to "MRC Global", "we", "our" and "us" mean the Company. 
We have two classes of stock: common stock, $.01 par value per share ("common stock"), and 6.5% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock ("preferred stock", and together with the common stock ("stock")). You are receiving these materials because, at the close of business on March 6, 2019 (the "Record Date"), you owned shares of stock. All stockholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. Each common stockholder will have one vote on each matter for every share of common stock owned on the Record Date. On the Record Date, we had a total of 105,614,908 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 21,106,597 shares are held in treasury, resulting in 84,508,311 shares of common stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Any shares held in our treasury on the Record Date are not considered outstanding and will not be voted or considered present at the meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. On the Record Date, we had a total of 363,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding entitled to 20,302,009 votes at the Annual Meeting, which number is equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of preferred stock could be converted on the Record Date, rounded to the nearest share. Holdings of the common stock and the preferred stock vote (on an as-converted basis) together on all matters as a single class. 
How is MRC Global distributing proxy materials? Is MRC Global using the SEC's "Notice and Access" rule? 
Under SEC rules, we are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders. On or about March 18, 2019, we expect to mail our stockholders (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials online, and to make the materials available as of that date on www.edocumentview.com/MRC. If you receive a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy via the internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a copy of our proxy materials, follow the instructions contained on the Notice about how you may request to receive a copy electronically or in printed form on a one-time or ongoing basis. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the internet as we believe electronic delivery will expedite the receipt of materials while lowering costs and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting by reducing printing and mailing of full sets of materials. 
In addition to this Proxy Statement and Notice, our proxy materials include our 2018 Annual Report (the "Annual Report") (which includes the Form 10-K). 
Copies of the Form 10-K, as well as other periodic filings by the Company with the SEC, are also available on our website at https://www.mrcglobal.com by clicking on "Investor Relations" and "SEC Filings". The information included in our website is not incorporated herein by reference.

         9    2019 Proxy Statement 
         9    2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
We are not aware of any matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting that is not included in this Proxy Statement. However, your proxy authorizes the persons named on the proxy card to take action on additional matters that may properly arise. These individuals will exercise their best judgment to vote on any other matter, including a question of adjourning the Annual Meeting. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a stockholder who holds stock in street name? 
If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), you are a stockholder of record. 
If you hold your shares with a broker or in an account at a bank, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name". Your broker or bank is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. Your broker or bank should provide you with instructions for directing the broker or bank how to vote your shares. 
How do I vote if I am a stockholder of record? 
As a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares in any one of the following ways: 
Unless you or your representative attend the Annual Meeting in person, the Company must receive your vote, either by telephone, internet, proxy card or voting instruction form by 11:59 p.m., Houston, Texas time on April 29, 2019 to be counted. Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. Houston, Texas time on April 29, 2019. 
If I hold shares in street name, does my broker need instructions to vote my shares? 
Under rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), if you hold shares of stock in street name and do not submit specific voting instructions to your brokers, banks or other nominees, they generally will have discretion to vote your shares on routine matters such as Proposal V, but will not have the discretion to vote your shares on non-routine matters, such as Proposals I, II, III and IV. When the broker, bank or other nominee is unable to vote on a proposal because the proposal is not routine, and you do not provide any voting instructions, a broker non-vote occurs and, as a result, your shares will not be voted on these proposals. 
Therefore: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● on the non-routine proposals of election of directors (Proposal I), approval, on an  advisory basis, of a non-binding advisory resolution approving our executive compensation (Proposal II), approval of an amendment to the Companys 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (Proposal  III), and recommendation, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal IV), your broker, bank or nominee will not be able to vote without instruction from you; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● on the routine proposal of ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered  public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal V), your broker, bank or nominee may vote in their discretion without instruction from you.

         10    2019 Proxy Statement 
         10    2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
How do I vote my shares? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can cast your vote at the meeting by calling the toll-free telephone number or by using the internet as described in the instructions included on the Notice. If you receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, you may also vote your shares by completing, signing, dating and returning your proxy card or voting instruction form. Your vote will be cast in accordance with the instructions authorized by telephone or internet or included on a properly signed and dated proxy card or voting instruction form, as applicable. If you are a stockholder of record, you can also attend the Annual Meeting in person and vote, or you can send a representative to the meeting with a signed proxy to vote on your behalf. If you do not vote by telephone or internet, return a signed proxy card or voting instruction form or attend the meeting in person or by representative and vote, no vote will be cast on your behalf. The Notice and proxy card or voting instruction form each indicates on its face the number of shares registered in your name at the close of business on the Record Date, which number corresponds to the number of votes you will be entitled to cast at the meeting on each proposal. 
You are urged to follow the instructions on your Notice, proxy card or voting instruction form to indicate how your vote is to be cast. 
Pursuant to Section 212(c) of Delaware Law, stockholders may validly grant proxies over the internet. Your internet vote authorizes the proxies designated by the Company to vote your shares in the same manner as if you had returned a proxy card or voting instruction form. To vote over the internet, follow the instructions provided on your Notice. If you hold shares in street name, you are encouraged to contact your bank or broker to obtain and return the appropriate voting instruction form. 
What if I return my proxy card or vote by internet or telephone but do not specify how I want to vote? 
If you are a stockholder of record and sign and return your proxy card or complete the internet or telephone voting procedures, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares, we will vote them as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    I.  FOR the election of the 10 director nominees  
   II.  FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of a non-binding advisory  resolution approving the Company's named executive officer compensation  
  III.  FOR the amendment of the Company's 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended  
  IV.  FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of a vote EVERY YEAR on executive compensation   
   V.  FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public  accounting firm for 2019  
[END TABLE]
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares? 
Attendance in person or by representative at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy. Any stockholder of record who authorizes his or her vote by telephone or by internet or executes and returns a proxy card may revoke the proxy before it is voted by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● notifying in writing the Corporate Secretary of MRC Global Inc. at Fulbright Tower, 1301 McKinney Street, Suite 2300,  Houston, Texas 77010, Attention: Daniel J. Churay;  
● executing and returning a subsequent proxy;  
● subsequently authorizing the individuals designated by the Company to vote his or her interests by calling the toll-free  telephone number or by using the internet by the telephone or internet deadline and as described in the instructions included on his or her Notice; or  
● appearing in person or by representative with a signed proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
For shares you hold in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee or by obtaining a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting.

What shares are included on my proxy card? 
You will receive one proxy card for all the shares of MRC Global that you hold as a stockholder of record (in certificate form or in book-entry form). If you hold your shares of MRC Global in street name, you will receive voting instructions for each account you have with a broker or bank. 
How may I obtain directions to attend the Annual Meeting? 
If you need assistance with directions to attend the Annual Meeting, call us at 713-655-1005 or 877-294-7574 or write us at MRC Global Inc., Fulbright Tower, 1301 McKinney Street, Suite 2300, Houston, Texas 77010, Attn: Corporate Secretary. 
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting? 
There must be a quorum to take action at the Annual Meeting (other than action to adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting for lack of a quorum). A quorum will exist at the Annual Meeting if stockholders holding a majority of the voting powers of all of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting are present in person or by proxy. Stockholders of record who return a proxy or vote in person at the Annual Meeting will be considered part of the quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
The following table sets forth the voting requirement with respect to each of the proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting may or may not require more than a majority vote under our bylaws, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the laws of Delaware or other applicable laws, depending on the nature of the matter. 
Who will count the votes? 
A representative of Computershare will act as the inspector of elections and count the votes. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We also will disclose the final voting results in a Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting. 
May I propose actions for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders? 
Yes. For your proposal to be considered for inclusion in our Proxy Statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, we must receive your written proposal no later than November 19, 2019. If we change the date of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the date of this year's Annual Meeting, then the deadline to submit proposals will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials. Your proposal, including the manner in which you submit it, must comply with SEC regulations regarding stockholder proposals. 
If you wish to raise a proposal (including a director nomination) from the floor during our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, we must receive a written notice of the proposal no earlier than the close of business on January 1, 2020 and no later than the close of business on January 31, 2020. Your submission must contain the additional information that our bylaws require. Proposals should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at Fulbright Tower, 1301 McKinney Street, Suite 2300, Houston, Texas 77010. 
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation? 
Our Board is soliciting your proxy. We expect to solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other electronic means. We have retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave, Stamford, CT 06902 to assist in this solicitation. We expect to pay Morrow Sodali LLC an estimated $7,500 in fees, plus expenses and disbursements. 
We will pay the expenses of this proxy solicitation, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the Notice, this Proxy Statement and related proxy materials. These expenses may include the charges and expenses of banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries for forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of MRC Global shares. 
Are you "householding" for stockholders sharing the same address? 
The SEC has adopted rules that allow a company to deliver a single Notice or set of proxy materials to an address shared by two or more of its stockholders. This method of delivery, known as "householding", permits us to realize cost savings and reduces the amount of duplicate information stockholders receive.

STOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION 
Security Ownership of Officers and Directors 
The following table shows, as of February 19, 2019, the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each of our directors, each of our named executive officers (NEOs) and all of our executive officers and directors as a group. 
Beneficial ownership is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Unless indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities that the table names have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable. Shares of common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of February 19, 2019 are deemed to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unvested restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance share units ("PSUs") are not included to the extent they will not definitively vest within 60 days of February 19, 2019. Except as otherwise indicated, the business address for each of our beneficial owners is c/o MRC Global Inc., Fulbright Tower, 1301 McKinney Street, Suite 2300, Houston, Texas 77010. 
As of February 19, 2019, the directors and executive officers beneficially owned 23.1% of our outstanding common stock (assuming conversion of all preferred stock to common stock). The percentage beneficially owned was calculated based on 84,301,522 shares of common stock outstanding on February 19, 2019.

Preferred Stock Issuance 
In June 2015, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations, Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations") creating the Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "preferred stock"), and establishing the designations, preferences, and other rights of the preferred stock. On June 10, 2015, we issued 363,000 shares of preferred stock and received gross proceeds of $363 million. In connection with the issuance, we entered into a shareholders' agreement (the "Shareholders' Agreement") with Mario Investments LLC, the initial holder of the preferred stock (the "Initial Holder"). The following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Certificate of Designations and the Shareholders' Agreement, each of which were filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 11, 2015. 
Voting and Other Rights 
The preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. The preferred stock has a stated value of $1,000 per share, and holders of the preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of 6.50% per annum. Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to vote together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, in each case, on an as-converted basis, except when the law requires a separate class vote of the common stockholders. Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, the Initial Holder and certain related parties if the preferred stock is transferred to those parties (collectively, the "Original Holder's Group") are entitled to vote their shares in their discretion, except that they have agreed to vote their shares in favor of director nominees that the Board nominates until June 10, 2020. Holders of the preferred stock also have certain limited special approval rights, including with respect to the issuance of pari passu or senior equity securities of the Company. 
Sunset Provisions 
The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holders of the preferred stock into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of 55.9284 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock, which represents an initial conversion price of $17.88 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. On or after June 10, 2020, the Company will have the option to redeem, in whole but not in part, all the outstanding shares of preferred stock, subject to certain redemption price adjustments on the basis of the date of the conversion. We may elect to convert the preferred stock, in whole but not in part, into the relevant number of shares of common stock on or after December 10, 2019 if the last reported sale price of the common stock has been at least 150% of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. 
Board Representation Rights 
Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, for so long as the Original Holder's Group maintained at least 33% of their original investment (whether in preferred stock or shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock), the Original Holder's Group has the right to appoint a single representative, in a non-voting observer capacity, to attend all meetings of the Board, subject to certain exceptions. 
Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations and the Shareholders' Agreement, on June 10, 2018, the Original Holder's Group had the right to designate one person to serve as a director on the Board if the Original Holder's Group maintained at least 33% of their original investment and shares of the preferred stock remained outstanding. The Original Holder's Group met such requirements and the Company was required to increase the size of the Board to accommodate the appointment of Henry Cornell as a director designated by the Original Holder's Group on June 10, 2018. The holders of the preferred stock also have certain Board representation rights if dividends payable on the preferred stock are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, but in no event may the holders of the preferred stock appoint more than two directors.

Also, pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, if no shares of the preferred stock remain outstanding but the Original Holder's Group maintains at least 33% of their original investment through their shares of common stock received upon conversion of the preferred stock, the Original Holder's Group may designate one nominee to serve as a director on the Board (the "Investor Designee"), subject to the Investor Designee's satisfaction of all applicable requirements regarding service as a director of the Company under applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules and such other criteria and qualifications the Company maintained that is applicable to all directors as of the date of the issuance of the preferred stock.

If for any reason the director that the Original Holder's Group appointed or designated is no longer serving as a director, the Original Holder's Group may appoint or designate a new person to fill the vacancy. At such time as the Original Holder's Group owns less than 33% of their original investment, pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, the rights of the Original Holder's Group terminate, and the Investor Designee must resign.

Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, the Original Holder's Group has certain registration rights, including customary demand and piggyback registration rights in respect of the shares of preferred stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock.

The foregoing standstill provisions will terminate early if a Change of Control (defined in the Shareholders' Agreement) of the Company has occurred, the Company has entered into an agreement providing for a Change of Control or a third party has made a public offer or proposal that would, if consummated, result in a Change in Control and the Board has not recommended against the offer or proposal within 10 days from the offer or proposal becoming public.

PROPOSAL I: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Election Process 
The directors of the Company are elected by the stockholders annually. The Board currently consists of 11 members. Ten directors are elected by holders of our common stock, and the eleventh director was designated by the holder of the Company's preferred stock. Each director's term of office expires when his or her successor is elected and qualified at the Annual Meeting. At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders will elect the 10 directors named below to hold office until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, or until their successors are elected and qualified, or their earlier retirement, removal or death. Each director has served continuously since the date of his or her appointment. All nominees have consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. If any nominee should be unable or unwilling to stand for election as a director, it is intended that the common stock represented by proxies will be voted for the election of a substitute director that the Board may nominate. 
As set forth in the Company's Certificate of Designations and the Shareholders' Agreement, the Original Holder's Group has the right to designate one person to serve as a director on the Board. The Original Holder's Group designated Henry Cornell to serve as a director on the Board effective June 10, 2018. The Original Holder's Group, as holders of the preferred stock, have indicated to the Company their intent to re-elect Mr. Cornell as of our Annual Meeting. Because Mr. Cornell will be elected by the holders of the preferred stock, his election will not be voted on by the holders of our common stock.

The Company's bylaws provide that for a director nominee to be elected, the director must receive a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy voting together as a single class with respect to that director nominee's election at the Annual Meeting. Abstention and broker non-votes will not be treated as either "WITHHOLD" or "FOR" votes cast for any nominee, and therefore will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal I — Election of Directors. Any director who receives a greater number of "WITHHOLD" votes than "FOR" votes in an uncontested election is expected to tender to the Board the director's resignation as a director promptly following the certification of election results pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Pursuant to these guidelines, the Board must accept or reject such resignation within 90 days following the certification of election results and publicly disclose its decision. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE 
"FOR" EACH OF OR "FOR ALL" THE ELECTION OF THE ABOVE NOMINEES.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate Governance 
General 
The primary responsibility of our Board is to foster the long-term success of the Company by promoting the interests of our stockholders. Our Board believes that strong corporate governance is critical to achieving our performance goals and to maintaining the trust and confidence of investors, employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, regulatory agencies and other stakeholders. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to help guide and promote our good corporate governance and responsible business practices. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide a framework for the effective governance of MRC Global as a whole and also address the operation, structure, and practice of the Board and its committees. The Board's Governance Committee reviews these guidelines at least annually at a minimum. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found on the Company's website at www.mrcglobal.com. 
Strategic Planning 
During the year, the Board meets with management to discuss and approve our strategic plans, financial goals, capital spending and other factors critical to successful performance. The Board also conducts quarterly reviews of progress on objectives and strategies. During Board meetings, directors review key issues and financial performance. The Board expects to meet privately with the CEO at least four times per year and meets in executive session without the CEO at each regular Board meeting and additionally as required. Further, the CEO communicates regularly with the Board on important business opportunities and developments. 
Board Membership and Refreshment 
The Board regularly considers the long-term make-up of our Board and how the members of our Board change over time. The entire Board selects nominees for the Board in accordance with the procedures and criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board will also consider director candidates from stockholders that have been properly nominated in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board will consider these stockholder nominees in the same manner and by the same criteria as Board nominees. The Board strives to maintain an engaged, independent Board with broad and diverse experience and judgment that is committed to representing the long-term interests of our stockholders. The Board seeks a diverse group of candidates who possess the background, skills and expertise to make a significant contribution to the Board and the Company. When reviewing director candidates, the Board considers each candidate's qualifications for membership on the Board, including the enhanced independence, financial literary and financial expertise standards that Audit Committee membership may require and assesses the performance of current directors who are proposed to be renominated to the Board. The Board considers qualified candidates for membership on the Board without regard to race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, sexual orientation, national origin or disability. While the Board does not have a formal policy on diversity, in assembling our Board, our objective is to have wide diversity in terms of business experiences, functional skills, gender, race, ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. Currently, 36% of our Board members are women or ethnically diverse. 
Board and Committee Effectiveness; Board Annual Self-Assessment; Board Education 
It is important that the Board and its committees are performing effectively and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board and each committee perform an annual self-assessment to evaluate its effectiveness in fulfilling its obligations. The Chair of the Governance Committee leads the Board in its review of the results of the annual self-assessment and takes further action as needed. During these assessments, the Board reviews the background and qualifications of each of their respective members, as well as an assessment of the Board's and each of its committees' composition in light of their respective needs and objectives after considering issues of judgment, diversity, age, skills, background and experience. In addition, the Company provides membership in the NACD to

 Board members, as well as the opportunity to attend director education programs at other institutions, to assist them in remaining current with exemplary board and committee practices and developments in corporate governance. 
Chief Executive Officer Evaluation and Management Succession 
The Board and the CEO annually discuss and collaborate to set the CEO's performance goals and objectives. The Board meets at least annually in executive session to assess the CEO's performance. The Board maintains a process for planning orderly succession for the CEO and other executive officer positions and oversees executive officer development. 
Communications with Directors 
Any stockholder or other interested person may communicate with our Board, individually or as a group, by contacting our Corporate Secretary or the Chairman of the Board. This contact information is maintained on the Investor Relations tab of our website at www.mrcglobal.com. 
The current contact information for either the Corporate Secretary or the Chairman of the Board is as follows and should be addressed to either of their attention, as applicable: 
MRC Global Inc. 
Fulbright Tower 
1301 McKinney Street, Suite 2300 
Houston, TX 77010 
Communications to directors at this address will be forwarded to the relevant director(s) except for solicitations or other matters not related to MRC Global. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
Our Board members are expected to attend our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All Board members standing for re-election attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees. The Code of Ethics sets forth guidelines for deterring wrongdoing and promoting conduct in accordance with ethical standards. Our Code of Ethics can be found on our Company's website at www.mrcglobal.com. If we amend or waive provisions of this Code of Ethics, we intend to also disclose the same on our website. 
Board and Committees 
Board of Directors 
The Board currently consists of 11 members listed under "Proposal I: Election of Directors" above. Ten directors are elected by holders of our common stock, and the eleventh director was designated by the holder of the Company's preferred stock. Our directors are elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified, which occurs at our Annual Meeting, or until their earlier retirement, removal or death. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our retirement age for directors is 73. 
On December 17, 2018, Gerard P. Krans tendered his resignation from the Board effective as of February 12, 2019 for personal reasons. All of the current members of the Board are standing for re-election. 
Director Independence 
The Board has determined that each of our director nominees, other than Messrs. Cornell, Lane, Ketchum and Wehrle, qualifies as an independent director within the meaning of Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and under the independence requirements that our Board has adopted as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

Board Leadership Structure 
As our independent, non-executive chairman of the Board, Mr. Best presides over all meetings of the Board and stockholders, reviews and approves meeting agendas, meeting schedules and other information, acts as a liaison between the outside directors and management, consults on stockholder engagement and governance matters and performs such other duties as the Board requires from time to time. The CEO is responsible for working with the Board in setting the Company's strategic direction and day-to-day leadership and performance. Having an independent non-executive chairman allows management to deepen its focus on customers, gaining market share, cost control, operational excellence and delivering shareholder value. The Board believes that having an independent, non-executive chairman: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  increases the independent oversight of the Company and enhances the Board's objective evaluation of our CEO;     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  provides our CEO with an experienced sounding board in the Chairman; and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  provides an independent spokesperson for the Company.    
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation, Audit and Governance Committees are currently comprised entirely of independent directors. The Board believes that having an independent, non-executive chairman of the Board and independent Compensation, Audit and Governance Committees provides a structure for strong independent oversight of our management. Each committee chair presides over the chair's committee meetings and reviews and approves meeting agendas, schedules and other information for the committee. 
Meetings of the Board and Committees 
During 2018,  the Board held five meetings. All directors attended 100% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and meetings of the committees of the Board on which the person served.* 
* Mr. Cornell attended 100% of the meetings of the Board that were held after his election to the Board. 
Meetings of Directors 
The directors of the Board meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions at times and for reasons as they desire and set, with at least four executive sessions per year. During the sessions, the chairman presides. 
The Board's Role in the Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for overseeing our risk exposure as part of determining a business strategy that generates long-term stockholder value. The Board shapes our enterprise-wide risk policies, desire for risk taking and acceptable risk tolerance levels that provide the foundation for our overall business strategy. The Board recognizes that risk mitigation not only preserves value, but, when managed appropriately, can create value and opportunity for the Company. 
The Board recognizes that purposeful and appropriate risk-taking in certain areas is important for the Company to be competitive and to achieve our long-term goals. Accordingly, the Board has established an enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework through which it regularly identifies key risks that face the Company and carefully considers our appetite for each risk. This ERM framework is designed to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate risks across the Company's operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness. 
As part of the Company's strategic planning process, the Company maintains a Risk Management Committee that assists the Board in identifying key risks. Our Risk Management Committee is 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         28    2019 Proxy Statement 
         28    2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 comprised of our CEO, executive vice presidents, senior vice presidents, vice president of human resources, vice president of information systems, vice president and controller, vice president of internal audit, vice president of tax, vice president of financial reporting and analysis, vice president of finance - international, assistant general counsel and assistant secretary, executive director of risk management, executive director and chief information security officer and executive director of investor relations. The principal responsibilities of the Risk Management Committee are to review, assess and monitor any material risks or exposures associated with the conduct of our business, the internal risk management processes or systems implemented to identify, mitigate, monitor or manage these risks or exposures and the Company's policies and procedures for risk management. 
Consistent with this approach, one of the Board's primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company's business, including risk assessment, monitoring, managing and risk mitigation of the Company's top risks. Our Board meets with senior management at regular Board meetings and, if necessary, at other times to discuss the strategy and success in addressing our identified key risks along with any other risks that we may face. 
In addition to the foregoing, the Board has tasked designated committees of the Board to assist with the oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. All committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function that typically focuses in their areas of expertise. In general, the committees oversee the following risks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Audit Committee: reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing the Companys  financial and accounting risk management and oversight processes and assists with the Boards oversight of financial and accounting matters, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and the Companys financial reporting  and internal control systems.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation Committee: reviews the Companys employee compensation policies and  practices to assess whether such policies and practices encourage long-term focus, support the retention and development of executive talent and discourage excessive risk-taking behavior.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Governance Committee: reviews and assesses enterprise risks that may be applicable to the  Company from time to time, including (among others) risks from cyber incidents, reputational risks and the risks set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 that we  filed with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
Although these committees assist the full Board with risk oversight, ultimately the full Board oversees the Company's enterprise risk management with regular presentation and discussion. 
In addition, throughout the year, the Board and the relevant committees receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail. The Company's senior management engages with and reports to the Company's Board and the relevant committees on a regular basis to address high-priority risks. 
The Company believes that the Board's leadership structure supports the risk oversight function of the Board by providing for open communication between management and the Board. In addition, strong independent directors chair the various committees involved in assisting with risk oversight, and all directors are involved in the risk oversight function. 
Committees of the Board 
The Company currently has three standing Board committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Governance Committee. Each committee's functions are described in detail in its respective charter, which is available on the Company's website at www.mrcglobal.com.

Legal Proceedings 
To the best of our knowledge, there is no material proceeding to which any director, director nominee or executive officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of the Company, or any associate of such director, nominated director, officer, affiliate of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Non-Employee Director Compensation 
As compensation for their services on the Board, we paid each non-employee director an annual cash retainer of $75,000. We paid the chair of the Audit Committee an additional annual cash retainer of $25,000, the Compensation Committee $20,000, and the Governance Committee $15,000. Each committee member (other than the chairs) received a $2,000 annual retainer for each committee membership. For all, retainers were paid on a pro-rata basis based on the time of service. The Company also granted restricted stock awards to each non-employee director in 2018, the number of shares of which pursuant to the Director Compensation Plan is determined by dividing $125,000, or in the case of the non-executive chairman $225,000, by the 20-day volume weighted average price ("VWAP") as of the date immediately preceding the grant date. All directors are also reimbursed for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings.

Executive Summary 
MRC Global is the largest distributor of pipe, valve and fitting (PVF) products and services to the energy and industrial markets. We serve the oil and gas industry across the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors as well as the chemical and gas distribution market sectors worldwide. 
MRC Global's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain our executives, including our NEOs, who are critical to the Company's long-term success. Our executive compensation strategy is "pay for performance" and is focused on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● motivating executive officers to increase the economic value of the Company by strengthening our position as a global  market leader in PVF supply and by aggressively pursuing profitable growth both domestically and internationally; and  
[END TABLE]

         33    2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
A majority of our pay is at risk or tied to key performance objectives. 
Our annual cash incentive plan is based on the achievement of target adjusted EBITDA2 & revenue3 measures. These measures are determined in advance and are aligned with shareholder interests, and a minimum level of performance is required before the plans pay out. 
Our long-term incentive plan is strongly tied to Company performance. We award performance share units (PSUs) that pay out based on three-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to companies in the OSX index4 and on three-year RANCE5 performance. We award restricted stock units (RSUs) to tie realized value to stock price and to provide retention value. 
We benchmark our pay levels against companies of similar size and that operate in similar industries or serve similar end-user markets. 
Our Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to benchmark pay. We review the peer group used for benchmarking on an annual basis. These peers were chosen as distributors or sellers of industrial or energy products of a similar character to those that we sell, as companies that have similar distribution or energy product business models to our business model or as companies that serve similar end markets as we do. We also considered revenue, enterprise value, market capitalization and assets of our peer companies when selecting our peers. 
We have taken decisive actions to adapt our compensation program with market and business conditions. 
Since going public in 2012, our executive compensation program has evolved to remain aligned with shareholder priorities and with market and business conditions. After the 2014 downturn in oil and gas markets, the Compensation Committee has quickly responded to changes in the oil and gas markets environment with the following actions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In an effort to control costs, the Compensation Committee implemented a salary freeze for the NEOs beginning in 2015. 2018  was the first year with salary increases (after 2012 for Mr. Lane, and after 2014 for Messrs. Braun, Churay and Bates. Mr. Bowhay received a pay increase due to promotion in 2016).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Compensation Committee applied a reduction factor to the 2015, 2016 and 2017 annual cash incentive payouts, which  reduced significantly the payout to the NEOs during these years (payouts were reduced by 32%, 50% & 32% respectively in 2015, 2016 and 2017). After a strong performance in 2017 (139% increase in adjusted EBITDA2, 20% increase in revenue over previous year), as well as an anticipated recovery in the oil and gas markets in 2018, the Compensation Committee decided in early 2018 that a reduction factor would not  be applied to 2018 annual incentive payouts. As a result, a normalized annual incentive plan was in place in 2018, which turned out to be a second consecutive year of strong financial and operational performance.

● Annual cash incentive plan measures have been designed to be based on primary drivers for shareholder value. Adjusted  EBITDA has always been a primary measure in the plan as investors and analysts often measure the value of common stock based on a multiple of EBITDA. In recent years, 75% of annual cash incentive has been based on this driver. Even during the  oil and gas downturn in 2015 and 2016, generating positive adjusted EBITDA was a key priority of the management team. The secondary 25% measure has changed from cash from operations in 2015 and 2016 (in these years, paying down debt using this  cash was a key shareholder concern) to revenue in 2017 and 2018 (in these years, Company growth and market share gains coming out of the oil and gas downturn have been key shareholder priorities). In 2019, as business improves, there is greater  focus on bottom line income returns; therefore, for 2019, the Company is changing the revenue measure to net income attributable to common stockholders to align total profitability with share performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We set rigorous performance targets for the 2018 annual cash incentive plan that required year-over-year growth for target  payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The long-term incentive plan has also evolved over time to be more directly aligned with Company performance. In 2015, we  implemented performance share unit (PSU) awards, which were granted along with restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. The PSU awards pay out based on 3-year total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to  the OSX index and 3-year RANCE performance against Board-approved stretch targets. The RANCE Target for both of the 2018-2020 and 2017-2019 performance periods were stretch targets. The 2018-2020  performance period was set at a higher level than the RANCE target for the 2017-2019 performance period. The 2017-2019 performance period was set at a higher level than the RANCE target for the 2016-2018 performance period.

MRC Global has performed successfully on a relative basis during the oil and gas market downturn and has delivered two consecutive years of growth from revenue of $3.041 billion in 2016 to revenue of $4.172 billion in 2018, an increase over two years of 37% coming out of the downturn. The Company's strong performance has increased adjusted EBITDA* of $75 million in 2016 to $280 million in 2018, an increase over two years of 273%. 
Throughout the downturn and subsequent recovery in the oil and gas markets, MRC Global produced positive adjusted EBITDA, dramatically reduced selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reduced debt, executed a share repurchase program and increased its market share. 
After weathering the downturn, MRC Global continued to adjust to rapidly changing and volatile conditions and took advantage of the rising oil and gas prices to deliver strong performance. 2017 and 2018 were two consecutive years of year over year growth in financial and operational performance. Our growth outpaced global exploration and production spending as the Company gained market share through multiple contract renewals and expansions.

We controlled operating costs, even in a growth environment, SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue declined to 13.5%. We increased our market share globally with multiple contract renewals and new wins in 2018. We optimized our working capital, strategically purchased inventory and effectively managed through a new tariff and quota regulations.

Pay for Performance Program 
Our Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, believes in a pay for performance philosophy. While our Compensation Committee sets target compensation for the executive officers each year based on market practices and internal considerations, the executive officers' realized compensation is strongly dependent on the Company's performance relative to pre-determined and measurable financial metrics and stock price performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● As illustrated in the following graphic, a substantial portion of the 2018 target compensation for executive officers was  at risk.

● Under our 2018 annual cash incentive plan, 75% of NEO performance was measured on an adjusted EBITDA target and 25% on a  revenue target, both of which were stretch targets.

● There was no payout relative to each of the performance metrics unless the threshold for payout was achieved for each  respective metric (threshold for payout was $195 million for adjusted EBITDA metric and $3,850 million for revenue metric). Target payout relative to each of the performance metrics was only paid out when the goal for each respective  metric was achieved. Maximum payouts are capped.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The 2018 long-term equity grant consisted of time-vested restricted stock units and performance share units for NEOs.  Vesting of the performance share units depends on performance based upon the Companys three-year total shareholder return relative to companies in the OSX index and achievement of stretch RANCE targets. The time-vested restricted stock units  provide retention value, and the value of the units is also tied to performance, since it increases or decreases in value depending on our stock price at vesting. The time-vested restricted stock units will vest ratably over a three-year period.

Participants in the Compensation Process 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee establishes policies and has decision-making authority with respect to compensation matters for executive officers (other than the CEO), including determination of the compensation and benefits and long-term incentive grants. With respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee recommends compensation decisions, including the grant of long-term incentive compensation, to the full Board, which then makes decisions regarding CEO compensation. 
Pursuant to the Compensation Committee's charter, its duties include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To review and recommend to the Board, the annual salary, bonus, equity and long-term incentive awards and other  compensation, incentives and benefits, direct and indirect, of the CEO, and to review and determine such compensation, incentives and benefits of the other executive officers. With respect to the CEO, the full Board makes decisions regarding CEO  compensation, taking into account (among other things) the Compensation Committees recommendations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of the CEO and the other executive officers,  and to evaluate the CEOs and the other executive officers performance in light of those goals and objectives on an annual basis, and, (either separately or together with other independent directors as the Board directs), to recommend to  the Board the CEOs and other executive officers compensation level based on this evaluation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To review and authorize or recommend to the Board to authorize, as the case may be, the Company to enter into, amend or  terminate any employment, consulting, change in control, severance or termination, or other compensation agreements or arrangements with the CEO and other executive officers of the Company (and at the option of the Compensation Committee, other  officers and employees of the Company);

Role of Compensation Consultant 
Pursuant to the Compensation Committee's charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain or terminate compensation consultants and engage other advisors. Since 2010, the Compensation Committee has engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"), an independent consultant specializing in executive compensation, to formulate a report and make recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding executive and director compensation based on peer group, other market data, industry trends and current practices. 
The Compensation Committee evaluated the SEC's and NYSE's six independence factors to determine that the service Meridian provided to the Compensation Committee was free of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest. Meridian does not provide any other services to the Company or its executive management team. 
Role of Executive Officers 
Our CEO, our executive vice president – corporate affairs, general counsel and corporate secretary (who leads our human resources organization) and our vice president of human resources provide support and information as the Compensation Committee requests. They make quarterly presentations to the Compensation Committee with respect to issues and developments regarding compensation and our compensation programs. They develop current and historical summary compensation data (including each element of compensation) for our executive officers and provide this data on a regular basis to the Compensation Committee. 
Our CEO provides the Compensation Committee with an evaluation of the annual performance of each of the executive officers that report to the CEO and makes preliminary recommendations for base salary and incentive target levels for them. Recommendations for base salary, annual performance, incentive target levels and incentive payouts for the CEO are left entirely to the Compensation Committee's discretion. 
The Compensation Committee then determines appropriate changes in compensation for the upcoming year. Each year, the Compensation Committee approves the executive officers' annual cash incentive awards (expressed in each case as a percentage of base salary) and the performance metrics and goals for annual cash incentive awards that the Company would pay in respect of performance during the year. The Compensation Committee makes decisions with respect to equity-based compensation awards that the Company grants to our executive officers. With respect to CEO compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee makes its recommendations to the entire Board for final approval.

Peer Group 
In October 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation peer group, and decided to continue with the existing peer group in 2018. The companies in the table below make up our 2018 compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee reviewed this peer group again in October 2018. These peers were chosen as distributors or sellers of industrial or energy products of a similar character to those that we sell, as companies that have similar distribution or energy product business models to our business model or as companies that serve similar end markets as we do. We compete for talent with these peer companies as well as other companies not in the peer group. We also took into account revenue, enterprise value, market capitalization and assets of our peer companies when selecting our peers. We excluded from our peers distributors that do not sell products in our oil and gas end markets such as distributors of swimming pool supplies, roofing materials, office supplies and dental appliances.

* Most recently reported information in S&P Capital IQ as of October 2018, when the Compensation Committee approved the peer group. 
† As of September 2018 
In February 2018, Meridian made a report to the Compensation Committee on publicly disclosed executive pay data, which the Compensation Committee considered when making its 2018 compensation decisions. Meridian used compensation peer data from the above companies for each position that our executive officers hold to the extent available. 
Meridian also provided data from the following two third-party general industry surveys for companies with revenue amounts similar to those of the Company as an additional reference point to validate the peer-company specific data:

[END TABLE]
Meridian presented compensation at each quartile of the data (both peer-company specific data as well as third party market survey data) to the Compensation Committee with respect to total compensation and major elements of compensation (i.e., base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity compensation) for each of the executive officer's positions.  
The Compensation Committee used this data to determine whether its compensation decisions were within the market for each executive officer; however, the Compensation Committee did not set any compensation for any executive officer at a specific level within the peer group range for each executive offer (such as pegging the compensation to a 50th percentile level). Even so, at the end of 2017, without giving effect to the 32% reduction of annual cash incentive targets for 2017 and 2015 and the 50% reduction of annual incentive target for 2016, the total target compensation of Mr. Lane, as CEO (including base salary, target annual cash incentive and the value of long-term equity grants on the date of grant), was below the median of the third-party general industry surveys and 6.5% above the median of MRC Global's peer group, while well below the 75th percentile. All of the other NEOs total compensation at the end of 2017 were below the median of both MRC Global's peer group and the third-party general industry surveys. Rather, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion considering the following factors:

2018 Executive Compensation Program Description 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
Our executive compensation programs are structured to reward the achievement of our specific annual and strategic performance goals, and our long-term objective of increasing shareholder value. Accordingly, the executive compensation philosophy of the Compensation Committee is threefold: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To attract and retain talented executive officers by providing competitive total compensation, and to motivate them to  achieve the Companys short-term and long-term financial and strategic goals and objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To provide performance-based cash and stock incentive awards to recognize and reward executive officers who demonstrate  sustained exceptional performance.  
[END TABLE]
We conduct an annual Say-on-Pay vote and pay careful attention to feedback from our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. In 2018, the Company's executive compensation program received the approval of more than 86% of the shares voted. We believe that our stockholders support our overall compensation philosophy and design and believe that compensation for our executive officers is aligned with Company and individual performance, and with stockholder interests.

[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
We provide our executive officers with a base salary to compensate them for services they provide during the fiscal year, and to provide a market competitive base level of pay commensurate with the skills and experience of our executives. The Compensation Committee, with the CEO, reviews base salary for executive officers based on the CEO's recommendations on an annual basis, and approves any increases based on each executive officer's position, responsibilities, contributions, leadership, performance, current compensation (both individually and as compared to other executives) and survey data. Increases are not automatic or guaranteed, and do not always take place each year. The Compensation Committee, on a similar basis, also reviews the CEO's salary and makes a recommendation whether to implement an increase to the full Board. 
Our NEOs had been subject to a salary freeze during the past few years due to the downturn in the oil and gas environment. Mr. Lane did not receive a salary increase since 2012. Salaries for Messrs. Braun, Churay and Bates were frozen since 2014. Mr. Bowhay did not receive a salary increase since his promotion to his current role in 2016. 
In 2018, the Company's financial results improved, a sustained recovery in the oil and gas markets continued, and there was a positive outlook for 2018. The Compensation Committee decided to award salary increases to the NEOs in 2018, to maintain a market competitive base salary for the NEOs, and taking into account the NEOs contributions, performance and leadership during the period of downturn. Mr. Lane's increase in salary to $900,000 remained below the median salary in the third-party general industry surveys. 
The Compensation Committee has not made any adjustments to salaries for the NEOs for 2019.

Annual Cash Incentive 
Our annual cash incentive plan is a performance-based plan, which provides cash compensation to eligible employees (including the executive officers), based on performance relative to certain financial and operational metrics. In 2018, a majority of our salaried employees participated in the annual cash incentive plan.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews annual cash incentive targets for executive officers on an annual basis. The targets are set at commensurate levels to incentivize executive officers to achieve financial and operational metrics, as well as to provide executive officers with market competitive levels of total cash compensation. In 2018, based on these considerations, Mr. Lane received an increase in Annual Cash Incentive Target percentage from 100% to 125% of base salary. When setting the 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Target percentage for Mr. Lane, the Compensation Committee considered total compensation market data for his position. After the Annual Cash Incentive Target percentage increase, Mr. Lane's total direct compensation remained below the median total direct compensation in the third-party general industry surveys. This was only one of the factors considered, for a detailed discussion on the factors used to set compensation see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Peer Group". There were no other changes to Annual Cash Incentive Target percentages for NEOs in 2018. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Performance Metrics 
The Compensation Committee sets the performance metrics for the annual cash incentive plan at the beginning of each year. Annual cash incentive plan measures have been designed to be based on primary drivers for shareholder value. Adjusted EBITDA has always been a primary measure in the plan as investors and analysts often measure the value of common stock based on a multiple of EBITDA. In recent years, 75% of annual cash incentive has been based on this measure. Even during the oil and gas downturn in 2015 and 2016, generating positive adjusted EBITDA was a key priority of the management team. The secondary 25% measure has changed from cash from operations in 2015 and 2016 (in these years, paying down debt using this cash was a key shareholder concern) to revenue in 2017 and 2018 (in these years, Company growth and market share gains coming out of the oil and gas downturn have been key shareholder priorities). In 2019, as business improves, there is greater focus on bottom line income returns; therefore, for 2019, the Company is changing the revenue measure for Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay to net income attributable to common stockholders to align total profitability with share performance. To reflect the sales component of Messrs. Bates' and Bowhay's job function they will continue to have revenue targets. 
The goal for each of the metrics was related to the consolidated performance of the Company and was determined by a budgeting process for the 2018 Company operating plan. This process involved an examination of our markets, customers, and general outlook with respect to 2018. The Board approved the final budget. 
* In 2017, the Compensation Committee reduced these targets by 32% to reflect market conditions at the time. Due to strong Company financial and operational performance in 2017, as well as a recovery in the oil and gas markets in 2018, the Compensation Committee did not reduce targets in 2018.

The maximum payout for the adjusted EBITDA metric was increased from 125% in 2017 to 150% in 2018, to incent the NEOs to achieve and exceed the stretch targets that were set for adjusted EBITDA in 2018, as well as to be market competitive with respect to annual cash incentive payout levels at maximum performance. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Payout Percentage 
In 2018, the Company generated adjusted EBITDA of $280 million and revenue of $4,172 million. 
Under the Annual Cash Incentive plan calculations for the NEOs, performance for the adjusted EBITDA metric was 108% of target and performance for the revenue metric was 103% of target. 
Based on this, each NEO earned 113.5% of the NEO's annual cash incentive target for 2018, as shown in the table below.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
Our long-term equity compensation is granted on an annual basis to our executive officers and is designed to align the interests of management with those of our stockholders. At the beginning of each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, we granted long-term equity compensation to the executive officers in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) under the Company's 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended. The RSUs, which comprise 50% of the total LTI award, vest 34% on the first anniversary of the grant date and 33% on each of the second and third anniversaries of the grant date. The PSUs, which comprise the remaining 50% of the total LTI award, vest at the end of three years based on relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance (compared to companies in the OSX index) and RANCE performance. 50% of the target PSU award is based on the TSR metric, and 50% of the target PSU award is based on the RANCE metric. The 2016 PSU grants vested based on 2016-18 performance. The 2017 and 2018 PSU grants will not vest until early 2020 and 2021, respectively. 
Alignment of Long-Term Incentive Compensation to Performance 
Our long-term equity compensation is strongly linked to stock price performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The realized value of PSUs is tied to long-term performance, since the value is directly related to the Companys  relative total shareholder return and RANCE performance. Because the PSUs pay out in the form of shares, the realized value of the shares that vest are tied to stock price performance. This also aligns NEO pay with shareholder value. The PSUs  provide retention value by vesting at the end of a three-year performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The primary purpose of the RSUs is to support retention and continuity of executive officers. The RSUs vest over a  multi-year period. However, the realized value of the RSUs is also tied to stock price performance, since the value of RSUs increases or decreases depending on our stock price at vesting.

2018 Performance Share Units (Relative Total Shareholder Return) 
50% of the target PSUs granted to NEOs in 2018 are based on relative total shareholder return (TSR) compared to companies in the OSX index from January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2020. The number of shares awarded at the end of the three-year performance period is based on the scale below. 
We compare our TSR to companies in the OSX index because investors generally compare MRC Global to companies that also have customers in the oil and gas business, with volatile spending patterns depending on commodity prices. Based on a review by Meridian, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, TSR correlation of companies in the OSX index compared to the Company's TSR is greater than other measures the Compensation Committee considered.

2018 Performance Share Units (RANCE) 
Fifty percent of the target PSUs granted to NEOs in 2018 are based on return on average net capital employed (RANCE) performance during the 2018-2020 period. The number of shares awarded at the end of the three-year performance period are based on the scale below. The RANCE Target for both of the 2018-2020 and 2017-2019 performance periods were stretch targets. The 2018-2020 performance period was set at a higher level than the RANCE target for the 2017-2019 performance period.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual cash incentive actually paid with respect to each year,  
[END TABLE]

● the value of any benefits and perquisites the executive received for each year (other than health care and other similar  benefits generally available to all U.S. employees).  
[END TABLE]
The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect what each NEO has actually made each year, because our NEO compensation, including that of the CEO, is more than 65% comprised of at-risk pay, actual compensation is paid or vested in calendar years different than the year of performance, equity vests over time, and the value of the equity often is dependent on strike price (in the case of option exercises) and performance (in the case of the PSUs). In addition, equity value is measured at the time of vesting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or, in the case of options, at the time of exercise.

The following chart illustrates the aggregate average annual compensation of the CEO based on the Summary Compensation Table for the three-year period 2016-2018 (the "Comparison Period") as compared to the average annual compensation that the CEO actually earned for the Comparison Period as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2. 
From late 2014 through 2016, we experienced one of the deepest and longest downturns in our oil and gas end markets. West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude prices dropped from $78.77 on November 3, 2014 to $26.19 on February 11, 2016. Since then, recovery has been slow, as WTI crude prices increased back to $60.46 on December 31, 2017 but dropped again to $45.41 on December 31, 2018. Our customers have cut their capital spending for our products during this period and have been slow to return to pre-downturn levels. Despite this, we have been able to recover much of our revenue during this time. Our 2014 revenue was $5,933 million and dropped to $3,041 million in 2016. In 2017, our revenue began to recover and was $3,646 million, and despite the WTI crude price drop in 2018, we have continued our recovery to $4,172 million in revenue in 2018. 
The CEO and the executive management team focused (among other things) on the following during the Comparison Period in response to market conditions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We reduced our debt. Net debt (and leverage) was reduced from $1,422 million on December 31, 2014 to  $641 million at the end of the Comparison Period, and our net leverage ratio, as defined on page 40, was reduced from 3.4 times to 2.3 times from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2018. We used $884 million of cash from  operations and $355 million from the issuance of perpetual convertible preferred stock to accomplish debt pay down.

● While revenue grew 14% from 2017 to 2018, our continued cost management resulted in selling, general and administrative  (SG&A) expenses that were up only 5% over the prior year. SG&A as a percentage of sales continued to decline for a second year in a row to 13.5% from 14.7% at the end of 2017 and from 17.2% at the end of 2016.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We returned capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $288 million of our common stock during the Comparison Period  at an average price per share of $15.57. This compares favorably to the current conversion price of our preferred stock issued in June 2015 of $17.88 per share.  
[END TABLE]

During the Comparison Period, our total shareholder return was 5.01% as calculated using the 20-trading day average on January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. This ranked at the 87th percentile of companies in the OSX index. 
For this same Comparison Period, the CEO realized average annual compensation of $4,336,831 based on his Form W-2 earnings as compared to the average compensation of $6,155,595 reported in the Summary Compensation Table. The CEO's realized compensation includes stock options that were granted before the Comparison Period, exercised in 2018 at a realized value of $493,206. 
Benefits and Perquisites 
The Compensation Committee reviews the benefits and perquisites provided to certain of the executive officers on an annual basis to ensure the reasonableness of these programs. We provide competitive health, welfare and retirement benefits to our Company's employees. Other than as outlined below, our current NEOs do not receive any additional benefits or perquisites. 
The Company reimbursed Mr. Bowhay the cost of a country club membership and provided Company-paid parking for Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay. 
Mr. Bates, an Australian citizen, receives certain expatriate benefits including a monthly tax-protected housing and utilities allowance, a superannuation (Australian retirement plan) supplement, a vehicle allowance with a fuel card for business travel, reimbursement for the cost of three business class air tickets between the United States and Australia for Mr. Bates and his spouse, a tax reimbursement related to protected allowances and tax preparation fees. 
The Company provides certain expatriate benefits to Mr. Bowhay, a subject of the United Kingdom. Mr. Bowhay receives a monthly tax-protected housing and utilities allowance, a vehicle allowance with reimbursement of business mileage, reimbursement for the cost of a maximum of five business class air tickets between the United States and the United Kingdom for him and for his spouse, a pension supplement, a tax reimbursement related to protected allowances and tax preparation fees. 
We provide our current named executive officers who have entered into employment agreements with us certain severance payments and benefits in the event of a termination of their employment under certain circumstances. We designed these agreements to promote stability and continuity of senior management. For additional information, see "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control".

Other Matters Related to Compensation 
Equity Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's executive officers and directors should own and hold an investment value position in the common stock of the Company to further align their interests and actions with the interests of the Company's stockholders. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the investment community values officer and director stock ownership, and that stock ownership demonstrates a commitment to and belief in the success and long-term profitability of the Company. Our executive officers and directors owned approximately 7.2% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018 (excluding the conversion of all preferred stock to common stock). The Compensation Committee has adopted the Equity Ownership Guidelines described below.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee intends for executive officers and directors who are or become subject to these guidelines to achieve the applicable ownership guideline within five years from the date of adoption of the guidelines or the date the participant becomes subject to the guidelines. If an executive officer or director becomes subject to a greater ownership amount, due to promotion or an increase in base salary (or annual cash retainer), the executive officer (or director) is expected to meet the incrementally higher ownership amount within the later of three years from the effective date of the promotion or increase in base salary or cash retainer and the end of the original five-year period. The three-year period to achieve the incremental guideline begins in January following the year of the promotion or increase in base salary or cash retainer. 
If an executive officer or director is not in compliance with the guidelines, the Compensation Committee may determine the appropriate action to take, which may include holding requirements on new grants of shares or the payment of a portion of the annual cash incentive or cash retainer in shares of our common stock. Any additional restrictions on previous awards must be agreed to by the executive officer or director. These guidelines may be waived, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, if compliance would create severe hardship or prevent an executive officer or director from complying with a court order, as in the case of a divorce settlement. 
All of our executive officers and directors met the equity ownership guidelines for 2018. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
Pursuant to the Company's Securities Trading and Disclosure Policy, directors and executive officers of the Company that are subject to the requirements of Section 16(b) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are prohibited from engaging in short-term or speculative transactions involving Company securities including:

Prior to the Company's initial public offering in April 2012, Mr. Krans, a former director of the Company until February 12, 2019, indirectly owned, through a limited liability company, an interest in PVF Holdings LLC ("PVF Holdings") along with over 400 other interest holders. Prior to the initial public offering, PVF Holdings owned 98% of MRC Global. The Board permitted Mr. Krans (and his limited liability company) to pledge his interest in PVF Holdings. Mr. Krans subsequently provided a general security interest in the assets of the limited liability company, including his interest in PVF Holdings. In May 2013, PVF Holdings was dissolved, and it distributed its MRC Global common shares that PVF Holdings owned to its interest holders, including to Mr. Krans' limited liability company. 
As Mr. Krans is no longer a director, there are now no outstanding exceptions to this policy. 
Prohibition on Re-pricing of Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights without Stockholder Approval 
Pursuant to the terms of the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, and a 2013 amendment to the 2007 Stock Option Plan, the Compensation Committee has no authority to make any adjustment (other than in connection with a change in capitalization or other transaction where an adjustment is permitted or required under the terms of the plan) or amendment and no adjustment or amendment shall be made, that reduces or would have the effect of reducing the option price of an option or the grant price of a stock appreciation right previously granted under the plan whether through amendment, cancellation or replacement grants or other means, unless the Company's stockholders approve the adjustment or amendment.

Pursuant to the Company's Clawback Policy, the Company can recoup certain compensation from covered employees in the event of a restatement of our financial statements due to theft, fraud, willful misconduct or negligence. All employees receiving any short-term or long-term equity compensation are subject to this policy. 
This policy covers all incentive and performance-based stock awards granted after the effective date of the policy under any Company equity incentive plan (e.g. stock options, restricted stock, and performance stock) and all cash performance awards (e.g. annual bonuses and other cash incentives) granted after the effective date of the policy. The recouped amount resulting from the restatement generally will be the difference between the amount of covered compensation previously awarded or earned and what would have been awarded or earned under the restated financial statements. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Our Compensation Committee is comprised solely of independent members of the Company's Board and includes Ms. Adams, Messrs. Perkins and Wood and Dr. Linse.

PROPOSAL II: ADVISORY APPROVAL OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
We request our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, a non-binding, advisory resolution approving our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in accordance with the SEC's rules in this Proxy Statement. This proposal is commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal. 
As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" as well as in the tables and narrative in "Executive Compensation", our compensation programs are designed to attract and retain the talent needed to drive stockholder value and help each of our businesses meet or exceed financial and performance targets. Our compensation programs are intended to reward our executive officers for successfully implementing our strategy to grow our business and create long-term stockholder value. We believe our programs effectively link executive pay to the financial performance of the Company while also aligning the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. The following are some key points that demonstrate our commitment to aligning pay to performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The majority of executive officer target compensation is provided in the form of long-term equity awards ensuring pay is  aligned with stockholders and linked to the performance of our Companys common stock; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our 2018 annual cash incentive program aligns payments to actual performance on  pre-established targets effectively linking the Companys financial performance to executive officer pay.  
[END TABLE]
We are seeking our stockholders' support for our named executive officer compensation as this Proxy Statement details. This proposal is solicited in response to SEC requirements and seeks our stockholders' views on our named executive officer compensation. It is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, but rather the overall compensation provided to our named executive officers including our pay philosophy, our pay principles and pay practices as this Proxy Statement describes. The Board asks for you to approve, on a non-binding basis, the following advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of MRC Global Inc. (the "Company") approve, on an advisory and non-binding basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and any related narrative discussion contained in this Proxy Statement. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board and will not overrule any decision by the Board or require the Board to take any action. However, the Board will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions for named executive officers. We currently conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation. Subject to the outcome of the stockholder vote on Proposal IV, we expect the next advisory vote following the vote at the Annual Meeting on our compensation of our named executed officers will take place at our 2020 Annual Meeting. 
To be approved, this proposal must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy, meaning that the votes cast by the stockholders "FOR" the approval of the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the approval of the proposal. Abstentions from voting on this proposal and broker non-votes will not be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE 
"FOR" THE RESOLUTION APPROVING THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION.

Risk in Relation to Compensation Programs 
We have performed a review of all of our material compensation plans and have concluded that there are no plans that provide meaningful incentives for employees, including the NEOs, to take risks that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Because our current compensation plans have a cap on the amount of incentive compensation that can be paid under the plans, risk of excessive compensation is negligible. This limit also has the effect of not encouraging operational or strategic decisions that expose the Company to undue risk.

CEO Pay Ratio 
For 2018, the CEO to median employee pay ratio is 79:1. We calculated the CEO pay ratio for MRC Global in 2018 in accordance with the SEC disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Because there were no significant employee population changes, pay program changes or changes to the 2017 median employee's circumstances, we decided to keep the same median employee for the second year of three allowed under Item 402(u). 
In 2017, we identified the median employee by calculating the median for 2017 total target cash compensation (which includes base salary or pay and annual cash incentive at target) for all full and part time employees of MRC Global as of December 31, 2017, excluding our CEO. We included employees from all countries where we operate in this calculation, without exception. We believe that total target cash compensation is an appropriate measure to identify the median employee, since the use of long-term equity compensation is not widespread at MRC Global. Less than 5% of MRC Global employees receive long-term equity compensation. 
After we decided to keep the median employee, we calculated 2018 annual total compensation for both the CEO and the median employee, using the same definition for total compensation as set forth in the Proxy Statement's Summary Compensation Table ("SCT") plus the value of benefits not reported in the SCT. These benefits include Company contributions to the medical, dental, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability and long-term disability plans, and the portion of group term life insurance premium that is not imputed income.

(1)  Based on the annual cash incentive performance metrics and goals that the Compensation Committee approved for the 2018  performance period, no portion of the awards based on adjusted EBITDA or revenue was payable unless minimum performance for those performance metrics was achieved. At minimum achievement of each performance metric, there is a payout of 25% of a  participant's target annual cash incentive with respect to the performance metric. The amounts in this column reflect 25% of the named executive officers' target annual cash incentive for 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Upon full achievement of each of the adjusted EBITDA and revenue performance metrics, 100% of the target annual cash  incentive is paid. For performance achievement between minimum and 100% achievement, payouts are interpolated on a straight-line basis. If performance metrics for adjusted EBITDA and revenue are exceeded, the maximum payments are 150% and 125%,  respectively, of target annual cash incentive. For performance achievement between 100% and maximum achievement, payouts are interpolated on a straight-line basis. The amounts in these columns reflect 100% and maximum payout of the named executive  officers' target annual cash incentive for 2018.

(3)  In 2018, long-term equity incentive grants included PSUs, which will vest at the end of three years based on relative  total shareholder return performance (compared to companies in the OSX index) and RANCE performance. For performance share units based on relative total shareholder return, payouts may range from 0% to 200% of target shares. For performance share  units based on RANCE, payouts may range from 0% to 150%.

Employment and Other Agreements 
Three of the current named executive officers have entered into an employment agreement with us. Mr. Lane's employment agreement commenced in May 2013 and was amended in February 2016. Mr. Braun and Mr. Churay each entered into amended and restated employment agreements in February 2014. In addition to the terms of these agreements described below, the employment agreements provide for certain severance payments and benefits following a termination of employment under certain circumstances. These benefits are described in the section titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control". 
The amendment to Mr. Lane's employment agreement extended his term of employment until May 16, 2020, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter, unless either party gives ninety days' written notice of non-renewal. The employment agreements of Mr. Braun and Mr. Churay each has an initial term of one year, which was automatically extended on the first and subsequent anniversaries of the date of the agreement and will be extended on each subsequent anniversary for one additional year, unless either party gives ninety days' written notice of non-renewal. Each agreement provides for an initial base salary, to be reviewed annually, which the Board (or a committee of the Board) may adjust upward at its discretion, and an annual cash incentive opportunity to be based upon individual or Company performance criteria that the Board establishes for each fiscal year, with a target annual cash incentive expressed as a percentage of base salary. The following table sets forth each current named executive officer's base salary as of January 1, 2018 and target annual cash incentive percentage:

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Each of Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay has an employment agreement with MRC Global. As such, each of these officers would be entitled to certain payments and benefits following a termination of employment under certain circumstances and upon a change in control. Each of Messrs. Bates and Bowhay also have certain rights under their letters of assignment with the Company. These benefits are summarized below and reflect obligations pursuant to employment agreements as well as pursuant to other compensatory arrangements. 
Voluntary Separation 
In the event of each current NEO's voluntary separation (other than retirement) from employment, all unvested stock options and unvested stock awards in respect of the Company's common stock that the executive holds would be forfeited. 
Under terms of the options and stock awards granted under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan"), if a current NEO retires and either: (a) the current NEO is at least 65 years of age, or (b) the current NEO's age plus years of service is equal to at least 80, the options and stock awards will continue to vest and become exercisable as if the current named executive officer remained employed with the Company; provided that the current NEO remains employed with the Company on or after the first anniversary of the date of grant unless the Compensation Committee waives this requirement. None of the current NEOs is 65 years of age, and none of the current NEOs age plus years of service is at least 80 or would be at least 80 during the following year. 
Each of the current named executive officers would be entitled to unpaid obligations including salary and accrued but unused vacation time as of the termination date, each as set forth in the table below.

Termination Due to Death or Disability 
Pursuant to the employment agreements with Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay and expatriate assignment letters with Messrs. Bates and Bowhay, upon a termination of employment due to death or Disability (as defined in the agreements), they (or their beneficiaries) would be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of the annual cash incentive for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, based on actual performance through the end of the fiscal year. 
Under the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, pursuant to the applicable award agreements, in the event of a termination due to death or Disability (as defined in the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan), the vested stock options and stock awards would remain vested and, in the case of options, would be exercisable until the first anniversary of the date of termination. The unvested stock options and stock awards that were granted to the current named executive officers would be deemed to be vested with respect to an additional 33% of the shares subject to the award agreement. With respect to PSUs, the number of the shares awarded will be based on performance at the end of the applicable PSU performance period, prorated based on the number of years the Company employed the participant in the performance period prior to participant's death or Disability, rounded up to the nearest whole year. Each of the NEOs (or their beneficiaries) would also be paid the value of any accrued but unused vacation time as of the termination date. 
Under the 2007 stock option plan, the vested stock options would be exercisable at any time prior to the earliest to occur of the 10-year anniversary of the date of grant or 24 months following the date of termination.

(3)  The amount in this column includes the value of the acceleration of the vesting of an additional 33% of the unvested  RSUs. With respect to PSUs, the number of the shares awarded will be based on performance at the end of the applicable PSU performance period, prorated based on the number of years the Company employed the participant in the performance period prior  to participant's death or Disability, rounded up to the nearest whole year. It is not possible to predict actual performance for the 2017-2019 PSUs and 2018-2020 PSUs; however, as of the date of the table above, the performance for the  2016-2018 PSUs are known and included in the table. In all cases, the value of the accelerated vesting is based on the closing price on December 31, 2018 of our common stock of $12.23.

Change in Control 
Under our employment agreements with each of Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay, if upon a Change in Control, or within 24 months following a Change in Control, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than for Cause, death or Disability, or by the Executive for Good Reason (each as defined in the agreements), the executive would be entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● All accrued, but unpaid obligations (including, salary, annual cash incentive, expense reimbursement and vacation pay);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Payment of an amount equal to the sum of 24 months (36 months for Mr. Lane) of the executives base salary and  two times (three times for Mr. Lane) the target annual cash incentive in effect on the date of termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Medical Continuation (as defined in each employment agreement) for 24 months (36 months for Mr. Lane).   
[END TABLE]
Additionally, pursuant to the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan and applicable award agreements, all options and restricted stock awards outstanding on the date of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan) would accelerate and vest. For PSUs, the end of each performance period is changed from the third anniversary of the beginning of the period to the date that the Change of Control has occurred, and the TSR and RANCE measures are then applied to determine the payout under the PSU awards. 
Each of Messrs. Lane, Braun and Churay's employment agreements and the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan defines a Change in Control as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  An acquisition (other than directly from the Company) of any voting securities of the Company (the "Voting  Securities") by any "Person" (as the term "person" is used for purposes of Section 13(d) or 14(d) of the Exchange Act), immediately after which such Person has "Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of  Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than fifty percent of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company and any other securities into which those shares are changed  or for which those shares are exchanged ("Shares"); or  
  (ii)  the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding Voting Securities;  
[END TABLE]
provided, that in determining whether a Change in Control has occurred, the acquisition of Shares or Voting Securities in a Non-Control Acquisition (defined below) shall not constitute a Change in Control; 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  The consummation of a merger, consolidation or reorganization (x) with or into the Company or (y) in which  securities of the Company are issued (a "Merger"), unless the Merger is a "Non-Control Transaction" (defined below);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  A complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  The sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a  whole to any Person (other than (x) a transfer to a Related Entity (defined below) or (y) the distribution to the Company's shareholders of the stock of a Related Entity or any other assets).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control will not be deemed to occur solely because any person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding voting securities as a result of the acquisition of shares or voting securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares or voting securities then outstanding, increases the proportional number of shares beneficially owned by the Subject Person; provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of voting securities by the Company and, after such acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the beneficial owner of any additional shares or voting securities and such beneficial ownership increases the percentage of the then outstanding shares or voting securities beneficially owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control will occur. 
A "Non-Control Acquisition" means an acquisition by:

  (a)  an employee benefit plan (or a trust forming a part thereof) maintained by:

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the Company; or

Mr. Lane has a target annual cash incentive of 125% of his 2018 base salary. In the case of Messrs. Braun and Churay, the amounts represent the continuation of their respective 2018 base salaries for 24 months plus 24  months of target annual cash incentive. Messrs.

(4)  Equity accelerates upon a Change of Control even if the NEO is not terminated from employment. Therefore, the amounts in  this column would have been payable upon a Change of Control on December 31, 2018 even if the amounts in the other columns were not payable because the NEO had not yet terminated employment. The amounts in this column include the value of the  acceleration of the unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs. For PSUs, the end of the performance period is changed from the third anniversary of the beginning of the period to the date that the Change of Control has occurred. The TSR and RANCE measures are  then applied to the shortened period to determine accelerated vesting amounts and payouts. For the purposes of the table, a December 31, 2018 change of control date was applied. As the 2016 – 2018 PSU performance is known as of  December 31, 2018, the actual performance was used. For the 2017 – 2019 and the 2018 – 2020 PSU grants, the table above reflects results as of the shortened performance period, which results could vary significantly from actual  results for the full three-year performance period. In all cases, the value of the accelerated vesting is based on the closing price on December 31, 2018 of our common stock of $12.23.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
This section describes material related party transactions between us and our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their immediate family members that occurred in 2018. 
Transactions with Hansford Associates Limited Partnership 
MRC Global (US) Inc., our principal U.S. operating subsidiary, leases certain land and buildings at various locations from Hansford Associates Limited Partnership ("Hansford Associates"), a limited partnership in which H. B. Wehrle, III (a member of the Board) and certain of his immediate family members are limited partners. Mr. Wehrle owns approximately 5% of Hansford Associates. MRC Global (US) Inc. paid Hansford Associates a rental amount of approximately $2 million in 2018. We believe that the rental amounts under MRC Global (US) Inc.'s leases with Hansford Associates are generally comparable to market rates negotiable among unrelated parties.

Transactions with Prideco LLC 
MRC Global (US) Inc. leases certain land and buildings at various locations from Prideco LLC ("Prideco"), a limited liability corporation in which Craig Ketchum (a member of the Board) and certain of his immediate family are members. MRC Global (US) Inc. paid Prideco an aggregate rental amount of approximately $133,000 in 2018. We believe that the rental amounts under the MRC Global (US) Inc.'s leases with Prideco are generally comparable to market rates negotiable among unrelated parties. 
Mario Investments LLC 
See "Preferred Stock Issuance" for a discussion of our relationship with Mario Investments LLC. 
Related Party Transaction Policy 
We have in place a formal written Related Party Transaction Policy for the review, approval, ratification and disclosure of related party transactions. This policy applies to any transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar or related transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which we were, are or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related party had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Audit Committee of the Board must review, and may approve and ratify a related party transaction that is subject to the Related Party Transaction Policy, if the transaction is consistent with the Related Party Transaction Policy and is on terms, taken as a whole, that the Audit Committee believes are no less favorable to us than could be obtained in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated third-party, unless the Audit Committee otherwise determines that the transaction is not in our best interests. Our Audit Committee does not need to approve or ratify any related party transaction or modification of the transaction that the Board has approved or ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors who do not have a direct or indirect material interest in such transaction. In addition, our Compensation Committee, rather than our Audit Committee, must approve related party transactions involving compensation of our directors and executive officers. 
Our credit facilities also contain covenants which, subject to certain exceptions, require us to conduct all transactions with any of our affiliates on terms that are substantially as favorable to us as we would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a person that is not an affiliate. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and certain of its officers to file reports of their ownership of MRC Global common stock and of changes in such ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Regulations also require MRC Global to identify in this Proxy Statement any person subject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a timely basis. Based solely on a review of the copies of these reports submitted to the Company and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of our officers, directors, and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our common stock complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Company's Audit Committee is composed entirely of non-management, independent directors. Our Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mss. Duganier and Adams and Messrs. Anthony and Perkins all meet the definition of "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC. In 2018, the Audit Committee held six meetings. Mr. Perkins, who departed from the Audit Committee in February 2019 when he was reassigned to the Governance Committee, attended all these meetings. Mr. Linse joined the Audit Committee in February 2019 upon Mr. Perkins retirement from the committee. The Audit Committee has adopted, and annually reviews and assesses the adequacy of a

[END TABLE]
 charter outlining the practices it follows. The charter, which complies with all current regulatory requirements, can be viewed on the Company's website, www.mrcglobal.com, by clicking on "Investor Relations," then "Corporate Governance," then "Committee Charters – Audit Committee." 
During 2018, at each of its regularly scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee met with the senior members of the Company's financial management team. The Audit Committee reviewed with senior members of the Company's financial management team, the independent auditors, and the vice president of internal audit, the overall audit scope and plans, the results of internal and external audit examinations, evaluations by management and the independent auditors of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and the quality of the Company's financial reporting. Additionally, the Audit Committee had separate private sessions, during each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, with the Company's general counsel, independent auditors, and the vice president of internal audit, at which candid discussions regarding financial management, legal, accounting, auditing, and internal control matters took place. The Audit Committee also discusses the effectiveness of the Company's compliance program and receives status reports on compliance issues. 
The Audit Committee is updated periodically on management's process to assess the adequacy of the Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting and management's conclusions on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent auditors their evaluation of the Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee reviewed with senior members of management, including the vice president of internal audit and general counsel, and the independent auditors, significant risks and exposures that management identified, the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's legal, regulatory and ethical compliance programs, including the Company's Code of Ethics and Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee discussed (among others) a review of the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606, preparation for the Company's planned implementation of the new accounting standard ASC 842 for leases effective on January 1, 2019 and preparation for the new auditing standard report requiring auditors to include a discussion of critical audit matters in their audit report. 
The Audit Committee evaluates the performance of the Company's independent auditors, including the senior audit engagement team members, each year and determines whether to reengage the current independent auditors or consider other audit firms. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services the auditors provided, the auditors' global capabilities, and the auditors' technical expertise, tenure as the Company's independent auditors, knowledge of the Company's global operations and industry and reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee decided to engage Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as our independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2019. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent auditors, the Audit Committee will continue its long-standing practice of recommending that the Board ask the stockholders, at their Annual Meeting, to ratify the appointment of the independent auditors (see Proposal V beginning on page 85). 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for appointing, compensating, retaining and overseeing the work of MRC Global's independent registered public accounting firm, including reviewing and evaluating the performance of the lead audit partner responsible for the Company's audit. E&Y has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 2007. 
Management has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit Committee including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant accounting judgments and estimates and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. In addressing the quality of management's accounting judgments, members of the Audit Committee asked for management's 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         71    2019 Proxy Statement 
         71    2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 representations and reviewed certifications that the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer prepared that the unaudited quarterly and audited consolidated financial statements of the Company fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, and have expressed to both management and the independent auditors their general preference for appropriate policies when a range of accounting options is available. 
In its meetings with representatives of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee discussed those matters required to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"), including the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communication with Audit Committees (AS1301). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence. The Audit Committee considered with the independent auditors whether the provision of non-audit services they provided to the Company during 2018 was compatible with their independence. 
In performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity. The Audit Committee reviews the Company's quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to filing with the SEC. In its oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting and for preparing the financial statements, and other reports, and of the independent auditors, who are engaged to audit and report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries and the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the reports of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for and overseeing the work of Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y), our independent registered public accounting firm, based upon the quality and efficiency of services provided by E&Y, their global capabilities, and their knowledge and expertise of our operations. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
On an ongoing basis, our management presents specific projects and categories of service to the Audit Committee to request advance approval. The Audit Committee reviews those requests and advises management if the Audit Committee approves the engagement of E&Y. On a periodic basis, the actual spending for these projects and services compared to the approved amounts is reported to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may also delegate the authority to pre-approve audit and permitted non-audit services, excluding services related to the Company's internal control over financial reporting, to the chairman of the Audit Committee; provided that any pre-approvals are reported to the Audit Committee at a subsequent Audit Committee meeting. In 2017 and 2018, the Audit Committee approved all of E&Y's services. 
The Audit Committee's pre-approval policy with respect to audit and non-audit services is an attachment to the Audit Committee Charter, which is available on our website at www.mrcglobal.com.

PROPOSAL III: AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S 2011 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
We use our 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as previously amended (the "Plan"), to provide long-term incentive opportunities in the form of common stock and other awards to our executives, employees, consultants and members of our Board. We make grants annually to our executives, employees and Board members. However, although the Plan allows us to make grants to consultants, we have not yet utilized the Plan for this purpose. Because of our annual grant practices, over time the remaining shares that we have reserved for issuance under the Plan are depleted until the number of shares would be insufficient for our incentive compensation requirements. 
In 2015, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Plan that added 4,147,475 shares to the Plan, which along with the 102,525 shares remaining at the time of the approval, provided the Plan with a total of 4,250,000 remaining shares. Based on historic grant practices at the time, we expected this pool of shares to be sufficient for three years until April 2018. In fact, this pool of shares has been sufficient through March 2019, with 778,272 shares remaining in the Plan, which with expected forfeitures, would cover most of the grants for a fifth year through February 2020. Even so, the number of shares may be insufficient for all of our requirements in 2020 and likely would not cover our requirements for additional years. Our three-year burn rate (2015-2018) has been approximately 1.4%. 
Because of this, we desire to amend the Plan to add 2,500,000 shares to the remaining shares, which would have resulted in a total pool of unused shares as of February 19, 2019 of 3,278,272 shares. Based on historical granting practices and the recent trading price of the common stock at the close of trading on February 19, 2019 of $18.33, the addition of the 2,500,000 shares is expected to cover awards for at least three years, or 2022. 
Long-term equity compensation plays an important part of the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy. Equity awards also help the Company remain market-competitive in retaining and attracting highly qualified employees upon whom, in large measure, the future growth and success of the Company depend. 
On February 11, 2019, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") recommended to the Board that it adopt an amendment to the Plan, as to increase the number of shares that can be issued under the 2011 Plan from 7,397,475 shares to a total of 9,897,475 shares (an increase of 2,500,000 shares reserved to the 2011 Plan (the "Amendment"). As of February 19, 2019, the 2011 Plan had 778,272 unused shares. On February 12, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the Amendment, subject to stockholder approval at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If approved by a majority of the votes cast by holders of the shares of common stock voting in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, the Amendment will become effective as of the date that the vote of the stockholders occurs (the "Effective Date"). 
Any stockholder of the Company may obtain a copy of the Amendment and 2011 Plan documents by sending a written request to MRC Global's Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices. 
Approval of the Amendment requires that a majority of the votes cast on the proposal are cast "FOR" approval of this proposal, provided that a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted on the proposal. For this proposal only, abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the proposal, while broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.

Determination of Number of Shares for the Amendment 
If the Amendment is approved, the aggregate number of shares of common stock that will be reserved and available for issuance after the Effective Date pursuant to awards under the 2011 Plan is expected to be 3,278,272. In setting the number of proposed shares issuable under the 2011 Plan, as amended, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered a number of factors. These factors, which are discussed further below, included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Shares available and total outstanding equity awards under the 2011 Plan, and how long the shares available are expected to  last.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Historical equity award granting practices, including the Companys three-year average share usage rate (commonly  referred to as burn rate).  
[END TABLE]

● Expected value transfer and dilution. 
[END TABLE]
Shares Available and Outstanding Equity Awards 
As of February 19, 2019, we had 84,301,522 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (not including treasury shares). Share usage under the 2011 Plan has been as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Grants in 2012     (1,064,761)   
 Grants in  2013     (827,843)   
 Grants in  2014     (630,291)   
 Grants in  2015     (915,109)   
 Increase of authorized  shares in 20157     4,147,475

[END TABLE]
Performance Share Units granted from 2017 through 2019 are reflected at maximum payout in the table above. Historically, PSU payouts have been less than target, returning significant shares to the 2011 Plan for reissuance. 
Historical Equity Award Granting Practices 
In setting and recommending to stockholders the number of shares authorized under the Amendment, the Compensation Committee and the Board considered the historical number of equity awards granted under the 2011 Plan in the past three years and potential dilution. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Company used approximately 1,600,000, 906,000 and 978,000 respectively, of the shares authorized under the 2011 Plan to make equity awards for an average per year of approximately 1,161,000. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board also considered the Company's three-year average burn rate (2016-2018) of approximately 1.4%. Based on historical granting practices and the recent trading price of the Common Stock at the close of trading on February 19, 2019 of $18.33, the Amendment is expected to cover awards for at least three years. The prior amendment was sufficient to cover four years, and this is reflected in the shares remaining above. 
7 On April 29, 2015, pursuant to Compensation Committee, Board and stockholders' approval, the 2011 Plan was amended to increase the authorized shares by 4,250,000 shares (less the 102,525 Remaining Shares, as defined in the 2011 Plan as previously amended).

Material Terms of the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
Overview. The Company adopted the 2011 Plan in November of 2011. The 2011 Plan became effective on April 9, 2012. The 2011 Plan is the primary plan pursuant to which the Company grants equity-based awards and other long-term incentive awards. The 2011 Plan was further amended on April 29, 2015. The following is a summary of the material to terms of the 2011 Plan. 
Purpose. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to foster and promote the long-term financial success of the Company and materially increase stockholder value by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● motivating superior performance by means of performance-related incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● encouraging and providing for the acquisition of an ownership interest in the Company by employees, directors and  consultants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● enabling the Company to attract and retain qualified and competent persons to serve as employees, members of management,  directors and consultants.  
[END TABLE]
Authorized Shares. The Board initially authorized a total of 3,250,000 shares of the Company's common stock for awards to be granted under the 2011 Plan. On April 29, 2015, pursuant to Board and stockholder approvals, the 2011 Plan was amended to increase the authorized shares by 4,250,000 shares (less the 102,525 Remaining Shares, as defined in the 2011 Plan as previously amended) to a total of 7,397,475 shares. As of February 19, 2019, 778,272 shares remain eligible for awards to be granted under the 2011 Plan. The shares available under the 2011 Plan include shares from awards previously granted that, prior to the Amendment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● terminated by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without any shares being issued;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● were settled in cash; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● were exchanged with the Committees permission prior to the issuance of shares for awards pursuant to which no shares  were issued.  
[END TABLE]
The maximum number of shares of our common stock for which options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs") may be granted to any participant in any calendar year is 1,000,000 shares. If certain changes in capitalization of the Company occur (such as reclassifications, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, reorganizations, stock splits, stock dividends and other changes in capitalization of the Company), the Committee will make appropriate adjustments to the maximum number of shares that may be delivered under the 2011 Plan and the individual annual limits included in the 2011 Plan. The Committee will also make appropriate adjustments to the number and class of shares of stock or securities subject to outstanding awards, the exercise prices of outstanding awards and any other terms of outstanding awards that the change in capitalization affects. 
Administration. The Committee administers the 2011 Plan unless the Board designates another committee to administer the 2011 Plan. The Committee has the discretion to determine the individuals to whom we may grant awards, what type of award we grant, when and how we grant each award and other terms and conditions of awards (including the number of shares of our common stock subject to each award and the vesting schedule or conditions of each award). The Committee is authorized to construe and interpret the 2011 Plan and awards we grant under the 2011 Plan, to establish, amend and revoke any rules and regulations relating to the 2011 Plan's administration and to make any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2011 Plan. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations that the Committee makes will be final and binding upon participants, the Company and all other interested individuals. 
No Repricing or Cashing Out of Underwater Options or SARs. The Committee is prohibited from directly or indirectly repricing, replacing or regranting a stock option or SAR to reduce the exercise or grant price or cashing out a stock option or SAR other than in connection with a change in capitalization or if approved by the stockholders.

Eligibility. The Committee may grant awards under the 2011 Plan to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries that the Committee selects. As of February 19, 2019, we had approximately 3,600 employees and 11 directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. To date, the Company has not granted awards under the 2011 Plan to any consultants, the number of which vary from time to time. 
Types of Awards. The 2011 Plan permits the grant of nonqualified stock options ("NSOs"), incentive stock options ("ISOs"), SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Stock Options. The Committee will determine the terms and conditions of each award of options, including whether the  options will be NSOs or ISOs. ISOs are subject to certain restrictions. To the extent an option intended to be an ISO does not qualify as an ISO, it will be treated as a NSO. The exercise price per share of each option the Committee grants will not  be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. A grantee may exercise an option by written notice and payment of the exercise price in cash or, as the Committee determines, by delivery of previously owned shares  or withholding of shares deliverable upon exercise or through a broker-assisted cashless exercise, or by any other method the Committee approves in its sole discretion. The maximum term of any option the Committee grants under the 2011 Plan will be  ten years from the date of grant, except that an option (other than an ISO) may provide that it can be exercised for a period of up to one year following a grantees death even if that extends beyond ten years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● SARs. The Committee will determine the terms and conditions applicable to each award of SARs, including the vesting  schedule. The grant price per share of each SAR will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Generally, one SAR will entitle a grantee, upon exercise of the SAR, to an amount equal to the excess of  the fair market value on the date of exercise of one share of our common stock over the grant price. Payment may be made in shares of our common stock, in cash, or in a combination of stock and cash, as the Committee determines. The maximum term of  any SAR granted under the 2011 Plan will be ten years from the date of grant except that a SAR may provide that in can be exercised for a period of up to one year following a grantees death even if that extends beyond ten years.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Restricted Stock and RSUs. The Committee will determine the terms and conditions applicable to each award of  restricted stock and RSUs, including the vesting conditions (which may be time-based, performance-based or a combination of time-based and performance-based). Restricted stock awards consist of shares of our common stock that are transferred to a  grantee subject to vesting conditions that will result in forfeiture of the shares if the specified conditions are not satisfied. Dividends paid in respect of shares of restricted stock may be paid to the grantee as and when dividends are paid to  stockholders or at the time that the restricted stock vests, as the Committee determines. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, holders of restricted stock will have the right to vote the shares prior to vesting. RSUs provide a grantee the  right to receive shares of our common stock, or cash equal to the fair market value of our shares, at a future date upon or following the attainment of certain conditions the Committee specifies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Performance Shares and Performance Units. The Committee will determine the terms and conditions applicable to each  award of performance shares and performance units, including the performance conditions. Performance shares will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, while performance units will have an  initial notional value equal to a dollar amount determined by the Committee, in accordance with the 2011 Plan. At the end of the applicable performance period, the number of performance shares or performance units earned will be determined based on  the extent to which the performance goals the Committee establishes have been achieved. Performance shares and performance units may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as the Committee determines.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Other Stock-Based Awards and Cash-Based Awards. The Committee has the authority to award other types of equity-based  or cash-based awards under the 2011 Plan, including the grant or offer for sale of shares of our common stock that are not subject to vesting requirements or the right to receive one or more cash payments subject to the satisfaction of conditions  the Committee specifies.  
[END TABLE]
Vesting/Performance Criteria. Vesting of awards granted under the 2011 Plan may be subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals the Committee establishes. To the extent the vesting/performance goal is time-based, the applicable time period that the Board or the Committee sets may not be less than one year. The performance goals may vary from participant to participant, group to group and period to period. Performance goals may be weighted for different factors and measures. 
Transferability. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, awards granted under the 2011 Plan will generally not be transferable by grantees except in the case of NSOs and SARs pursuant to domestic relations orders. 
Change in Control. The Committee will determine the treatment of awards granted under the 2011 Plan if a change in control occurs (as defined in the 2011 Plan). 
Effect of Certain Transactions. If a liquidation, dissolution, merger or consolidation of the Company occurs (a "Transaction"), either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● each outstanding award will be treated in accordance with the agreement entered into in connection with the relevant  Transaction, which may include, the assumption or continuation of awards by, or the substitution for the awards of new awards of, the surviving, successor or resulting entity, or a parent or subsidiary any of those entities, with equitable  adjustments; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● if not so provided in the Transaction agreement, all outstanding awards will terminate upon the consummation of the  Transaction, provided, however, that vested awards shall not be terminated without:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡   in the case of vested options and SARs, (1) providing the holders of affected options and SARs a reasonable period  of time prior to the date of the consummation of the Transaction to exercise the options and SARs, or (2) providing the holders of affected options and SARs payment (in cash or other consideration) in respect of each share covered by the option  or SARs being cancelled an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the per share price to be paid or distributed to stockholders in the Transaction over the exercise price of the options or the grant price of the SARs; for the avoidance of doubt, the  Company may cancel any option or SAR without any payment if the exercise price of the option or SAR exceeds the per share price for our common stock in the relevant Transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡   in the case of vested awards other than options or SARs, providing the holders of affected awards payment (in cash or  other consideration) in respect of each share covered by the award being cancelled of the per share price to be paid or distributed to stockholders in the Transaction.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee may, in its discretion and without the need for the consent of any recipient of an award, take one or more of the following actions to be effective upon the occurrence of or at any time prior to any Transaction (and any such action may be made contingent upon the occurrence of the Transaction): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● cause any or all outstanding awards to become vested and immediately exercisable (as applicable), in whole or in part;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● cancel all or any outstanding options or SARs by either:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡   providing holders with a reasonable period of time to exercise the options or SARs (whether or not they were otherwise  exercisable); or  
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡   providing them with a cash payment in respect of each share covered by the options or SARs being cancelled in an amount  equal to the excess, if any, of the per share price being paid in the Transaction over the exercise or grant price of the option or SAR. The Company may cancel any option or SAR without any payment if the exercise price of the option or SAR exceeds  the per share price for our common stock in the relevant Transaction; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● cancel awards other than options and SARs by providing holders with a payment equal to the per share price being paid in  the Transaction, which may in the case of unvested awards, be paid in accordance with the vesting schedule of the award.  
[END TABLE]
Tax Withholding. The Company has the right to withhold all amounts required to be withheld from any payment under the 2011 Plan or to require a grantee to satisfy all applicable tax withholding requirements prior to any payment or issuance or release of shares pursuant to any award. The 2011 Plan allows a participant, with respect to a payment in shares of our common stock under the 2011 Plan, to elect, subject to the approval of the Committee, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having us withhold shares of our common stock having a fair market value on the date the withholding is to be determined that is equal to the withholding amount. 
Effectiveness of the 2011 Plan; Amendment and Termination. The 2011 Plan became effective on April 9, 2012 and was amended on April 29, 2015. The 2011 Plan will remain available for the grant of awards until the tenth anniversary of the effective date. The Board may amend or terminate the 2011 Plan or any outstanding awards made under the 2011 Plan at any time, except that stockholder approval will be required for any amendment to the 2011 Plan if required by applicable law or stock market requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or termination of the 2011 Plan or outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan that would adversely affect the rights of a grantee under any outstanding award may be made without the relevant grantee's consent except as expressly set forth in the 2011 Plan. 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards Granted Under the 2011 Plan to Participants 
The following is a general summary of certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences to participants who are either U.S. citizens or residents with respect to awards granted under the 2011 Plan. 
Incentive Stock Options 
When the Committee grants an employee an ISO to purchase shares of our common stock under the 2011 Plan, the employee will not be required to recognize any U.S. Federal taxable income as a result of the grant or as a result of the employee's exercise of the ISO; however, the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares of our common stock at the time of exercise is an item of tax preference that may require payment of an alternative minimum tax. On the sale of the shares acquired through exercise of an ISO (assuming such sale does not occur within two years of the date of grant of the ISO or within one year from the date of exercise), any gain (or loss) will be taxed as long term capital gain (or loss) and we will not be entitled to any deduction in connection with the sale (or the grant or exercise) of the ISO. With respect to a sale of shares that occurs after the later of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, the tax basis of the shares for the purpose of a subsequent sale includes the option price paid for the shares. 
However, if the employee sells the shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO before the later of (i) two years from the date of grant and (ii) one year from the date of exercise, the employee will be treated as having received, at the time of sale, compensation taxable as ordinary income, and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. The amount treated as compensation income is the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price, and any amount realized in excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise would be treated as long or short-term capital gain, depending on how long such shares were held. With respect to a sale of shares that occurs before the later of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, the tax basis of the shares for the purpose of a subsequent sale includes the option price paid for the shares and the compensation income reported at the time of sale of the shares.

Nonqualified Stock Options 
When the Committee grants an NSO to purchase shares of our common stock under the 2011 Plan, the recipient will not be required to recognize any U.S. Federal taxable income as a result of the grant. However, the recipient will be required to recognize ordinary income on the date the recipient exercises the NSO. Generally, the measure of the income will be equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares of our common stock acquired on the date the shares are acquired and the option price. The tax basis of the shares acquired on exercise of the NSO for the purpose of a subsequent sale includes the option price paid and the ordinary income reported on exercise of the NSO. The income reportable on exercise of the NSO by an employee is subject to Federal tax withholding. Generally, we will be entitled to a deduction in the amount reportable as income by the recipient on the exercise of a NSO. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
The grant of a SAR under the 2011 Plan generally will not result in the recognition of any U.S. Federal taxable income by the recipient or a deduction for us, at the time of grant. However, the recipient will be required to recognize ordinary income on the date the recipient exercises the SAR equal to the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the date of grant and the exercise date of the SAR (assuming the grant price was set at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant). Generally, the measure of the income will be equal to the amount realized on exercise of the SAR. The income reportable on exercise of the SAR by an employee is subject to Federal tax withholding. Generally, we will be entitled to a deduction in the amount reportable as income by the recipient on the exercise of a SAR. 
Restricted Stock Awards 
The grant of a restricted stock award under the 2011 Plan generally will not result in the recognition of any U.S. Federal taxable income by the recipient or a deduction for us at the time of grant unless the recipient timely makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as described below. Upon the expiration of the forfeiture restrictions applicable to the restricted stock award (i.e., as the shares become vested), the recipient will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of those shares at that time over the amount (if any) the recipient paid for the shares. The income realized by an employee is subject to federal tax withholding. We will be entitled to a deduction in the amount and at the time the recipient recognizes income. If an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code has not been made, any dividends received with respect to any restricted shares that are not vested (i.e., the forfeiture restrictions have not yet lapsed) generally will be treated as compensation that is taxable as ordinary income to the recipient and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. With respect to any restricted shares that are vested (i.e., the forfeiture restrictions have lapsed), the recipient will be taxed on any dividends on such shares as the dividends are paid to the recipient (and such dividends will be characterized as dividend income and not compensation income) and we will not be entitled to deductions with respect to the dividends paid. 
If a participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code within 30 days of the date of transfer of the restricted shares awarded under the restricted stock award, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the date the shares are awarded. The amount of ordinary income required to be recognized is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares on the date of award over the amount, if any, paid for such shares. In such case, the participant will not be required to recognize additional ordinary income when the shares vest. However, if the shares are later forfeited, a loss can only be recognized up to the amount the participant paid, if any, for the shares. 
Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
The grant of an RSU award under the 2011 Plan generally will not result in the recognition of any U.S. Federal taxable income by the recipient or a deduction for us at the time of grant. At the time the RSU award vests and is paid the recipient will recognize ordinary income and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Generally, the measure of the income and deduction with respect to an RSU will be the fair market value of our common stock at the time the RSU is paid. The income realized under the RSU award that is reportable by an employee is subject to Federal tax withholding.

Performance Share and Performance Unit Awards 
Performance share awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally have the same tax consequences as restricted stock awards, as discussed above. 
A recipient of a performance unit award under the 2011 Plan generally will not realize U.S. federal taxable income at the time of grant of the award, and we will not be entitled to a deduction at that time with respect to the award. When the performance goals applicable to the performance unit award are attained and amounts are paid under the award, the holder of the award will be treated as receiving compensation taxable as ordinary income, and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. 
Other Cash-Based and Stock-Based Awards 
The grant of a cash-based award under the 2011 Plan generally will not result in the recognition of any U.S. federal taxable income by the recipient or a deduction for us at the time of grant. Generally, at the time the other cash-based award is settled in cash, the recipient will recognize ordinary income and we will be entitled to a corresponding deduction, in the amount of cash received by the recipient under the award at that time. 
Other stock-based awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally have the same tax consequences as RSU awards, as described above.

PROPOSAL IV: RECOMMENDATION, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE FREQUENCY OF AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
What am I voting on? 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which provides for our stockholders to indicate how frequently the Company should seek approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. Proposal IV is submitted to you as required pursuant to Section 14A. By voting on this proposal, stockholders may indicate whether they prefer an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every one, two or three years, or abstain on this matter. We currently hold such vote every year. 
What does the Board recommend? 
After careful consideration, our Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate choice for the Company. Therefore, our Board recommends that you vote for an annual advisory vote on named executive officer compensation, for the reasons stated below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● An annual advisory vote will give stockholders a formal mechanism for providing their direct input on our compensation  philosophy, policy and practices as disclosed in our Proxy Statement every year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● An annual advisory vote is consistent with our policy of seeking input from and engaging in discussions with our  shareholders regarding executive compensation and may encourage additional dialogue.  
[END TABLE]
While this is an advisory vote, and, as such, is nonbinding, our Board will carefully consider the results of the vote when deciding when to call for the next advisory vote on named executive officer compensation. 
Please indicate your preference as to the frequency of holding shareholder advisory votes on named executive officer compensation as every one, every two or every three years, or you may mark "Abstain" on this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE FOR THE OPTION OF "EVERY YEAR (1 YEAR)" AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH STOCKHOLDERS ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

PROPOSAL V: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting our independent, registered public accounting firm. At a meeting held on February 11, 2019, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y) as the independent auditors to audit our financial statements for calendar year 2019. A representative of E&Y will attend the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. Stockholder approval of the appointment of E&Y is not required, but the Audit Committee and the Board are submitting the selection of E&Y for ratification to obtain our stockholders' views. If a majority of the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of E&Y, the Audit Committee and the Board will consider the voting results and evaluate whether to select a different independent auditor. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019.
