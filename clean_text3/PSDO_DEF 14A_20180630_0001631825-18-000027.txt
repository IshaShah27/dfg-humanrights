The Board is asking you to ratify the selection of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Questions and Answers About the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Why am I receiving these materials? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Our Board has made these materials available to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting.  As a stockholder, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are requested to vote on the items of business described in this proxy statement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Two proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The election of the three Class II directors specified in this proxy statement for a three-year term, expiring at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What are the Board's recommendations? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Our Board recommends that you vote: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the three nominated Class II directors specified in this proxy statement (Proposal 1); and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 (Proposal 2). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxy holders, Robert Cagnazzi, our Chief Executive Officer, and Neil Johnston, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, or either of them, will have discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment.  We do not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who is entitled to vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Stockholders of record at the close of business on September 12, 2018 (the "record date") may vote at the Annual Meeting.  As of the close of business on the record date, there were 93,040,811 shares of our common stock outstanding.  Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters being considered at the Annual Meeting.  There is no cumulative voting. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting shall constitute a quorum.  Both abstentions and broker non-votes (discussed below under "How may my brokerage firm or other intermediary vote my shares if I fail to provide timely directions?") are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Stockholder of Record.  If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., you are considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares.  Stockholders of record received printed proxy materials directly from us. 
[END TABLE]
 Beneficial Owner.  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name.  Your broker, bank or nominee, who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, forwarded the proxy materials to you.  As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote your shares by completing the voting instruction form.  Because a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You may vote using any of the following methods: 
[END TABLE]
By Mail - Stockholders of record may submit proxies by completing, signing and dating their proxy cards and mailing them in the accompanying pre-addressed envelopes.  If you return your signed proxy but do not indicate your voting preferences, your shares will be voted on your behalf as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the three nominated Class II directors specified in this proxy statement for a three-year term expiring at our Annual Meeting in 2021 (Proposal 1); and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 (Proposal 2). 
[END TABLE]
Presidio stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may provide voting instructions by mail by completing, signing and dating the voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, banks or other nominees and mailing them in the accompanying pre-addressed envelopes.
By Internet - Stockholders of record of our common stock with internet access may submit proxies by following the internet voting instructions on their proxy cards.  Most Presidio stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name may provide voting instructions by accessing the website specified on the voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, banks or nominees.  Please check the voting instruction form for internet voting availability.  If you vote electronically on the internet and do not vote on all matters, your shares will be voted on your behalf as shown above.
By Telephone - Stockholders of record of our common stock who live in the United States or Canada may submit proxies by following the telephone voting instructions on their proxy cards.  Most Presidio stockholders who hold shares beneficially in street name and live in the United States or Canada may provide voting instructions by telephone by calling the number specified on the voting instruction forms provided by their brokers, banks or nominees.  Please check the voting instruction form for telephone voting availability.  If you vote by telephone and do not vote on all matters, your shares will be voted on your behalf as shown above.
In Person at the Annual Meeting - Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting.  Shares held beneficially in street name may be voted in person only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares.  Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also submit your proxy or voting instructions by mail, telephone, or the internet so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting.  If you submitted your proxy by mail, you must file with the Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation or deliver, prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting, a valid, later-dated proxy.  If you submitted your proxy by telephone or the internet, you may revoke your proxy with a later telephone or internet proxy, as the case may be.  Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not have the effect of revoking a proxy unless you give written notice of revocation to the Secretary before the proxy is exercised or you vote by written ballot at the Annual Meeting.  If you are a beneficial owner, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or nominee, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What vote is required to approve each item? How may my brokerage firm or other intermediary vote my shares if I fail to provide timely directions? 
Item Vote Required Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed
Item Vote Required Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed
Proposal 1 - The election of Class II directors Plurality of Votes Cast No 
Proposal 2 - The ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 Majority of the Shares Present in Person or Represented by Proxy and Entitled to Vote Yes 
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, the brokerage firm has the discretion to vote the shares on your behalf if the proposal is considered a "routine" matter.  When a proposal is not a "routine" matter and the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal.  This is called a "broker non-vote." 
Proposal 1 is not considered a "routine" matter, but the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2) is considered a "routine" matter.  In tabulating the voting results for any non-routine proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal.  Thus, while broker non-votes would be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum, they will not affect the outcome of any non-routine matters being voted on at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What percentage of stock does our largest stockholder own and how does our largest stockholder intend to vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Through our stockholder AP VIII Aegis Holdings, L.P. ("Aegis LP"), investment funds (the "Apollo Funds") affiliated with or managed by Apollo Global Management, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, "Apollo") own approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock as of the record date.  As a result, Apollo controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, and we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the "NASDAQ").  Aegis LP has indicated that it will vote its shares in favor of the director nominees named in our proxy statement, and in favor of Proposal 2.  If Aegis LP votes as it has indicated, its vote is sufficient to satisfy the quorum and voting requirements necessary to elect the director nominees and to approve Proposal 2. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How are proxies solicited? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The costs and expenses of soliciting proxies from stockholders will be paid by the Company.  Employees, officers and directors of the Company, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies.  We do not plan to retain the services of a proxy solicitation firm to assist us in this solicitation.  In addition, we will, upon request, reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation material to the beneficial owners of our common stock. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the effect of giving a proxy? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Proxies are solicited by and on behalf of the Board.  Robert Cagnazzi, our Chief Executive Officer, and Neil Johnston, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have been designated as proxy holders by the Board.  When proxies are properly dated, executed and returned, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder.  If no specific instructions are given, however, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board as described above.  If any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the Annual Meeting pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, the proxy holders will use their own judgment to determine how to vote the shares.  If the Annual Meeting is adjourned, the proxy holders can vote the shares on the new Annual Meeting date as well, unless you have properly revoked your proxy instructions, as described above. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials.  How may I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has approved.  Under this procedure, we deliver a single copy of the Notice and, if applicable, our proxy materials to multiple stockholders who share the same address, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of such stockholders.  This procedure reduces our printing and mailing costs and fees.  Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards.  Upon written or oral request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of the Notice and, if applicable, our proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these materials.  To receive a separate copy, or, if a stockholder is receiving multiple copies, to request that we only send a single copy of the Notice and, if applicable, our proxy materials, such stockholder may contact us at:  Presidio, Inc., One Penn Plaza, Suite 2832, New York, New York 10119, Attention:  Corporate Secretary. 
[END TABLE]
Street name stockholders may contact their broker, bank or other nominee to request information about householding.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the deadline for stockholder proposals for the 2019 annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: For your proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019, we must receive your written proposal no later than June 4, 2019.  In addition, be aware that your proposal must comply with SEC regulations regarding inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials and other applicable laws.  Although our Board will consider all proposals, it has the right to omit any proposals it is not required to include.  For you to raise a proposal (including director nominations) at next year's annual meeting that will not be included in our proxy statement, we must receive written notice of the proposal between July 10, 2019 and August 11, 2019 (assuming the meeting is held not more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after November 7, 2019).  All notices of proposals by stockholders, whether or not intended to be included in the Company's proxy materials, should be sent to Presidio, Inc., One Penn Plaza, Suite 2832, New York, New York 10119, Attention:  Corporate Secretary.  In addition, any proposal must satisfy all of the other requirements set forth in our bylaws and all applicable laws.  A copy of our amended and restated bylaws is available on our website at http://www.investors.presidio.com.  You may also contact our Corporate Secretary at the address set forth above for a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating director candidates. 
[END TABLE]
 PROPOSAL I - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Board currently consists of nine members:  Robert Cagnazzi (Chairman of the Board), Heather Berger, Christopher L. Edson, Salim Hirji, Steven Lerner, Matthew H. Nord, Pankaj Patel, Michael A. Reiss  and Todd H. Siegel.
In accordance with our certificate of incorporation, our Board is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms.  At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors is elected for a three-year term to succeed the directors of the same class whose terms are then expiring.  Our Board is currently divided among the three classes as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Siegel, Ms. Berger and Mr. Reiss are current Class I directors whose terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Edson, Hirji and Lerner are the Class II directors whose terms will expire at the Annual Meeting. Each of them has been nominated for election at the Annual Meeting for a three-year term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Cagnazzi, Nord and Patel are the Class III directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, only our Board is able to fill any vacancies on our Board until the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders.  Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors.  Each director's term continues until the election and qualification of such director's successor, or such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.  Directors may be removed only for cause and then by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power entitled to vote for the election of directors.
It is proposed to elect three Class II directors to serve for a three-year term expiring at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2021. Upon recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Messrs. Edson, Hirji and Lerner for re-election as Class II directors.  Biographical information about each of the nominees and each director whose term will continue after the Annual Meeting is contained in the sections below.  At the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote the shares covered thereby for the election of the nominees named below to our Board unless instructed to the contrary.  Each of Messrs. Edson, Hirji and Lerner is currently a Class II director of our company. NOMINEES FOR ELECTION FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM EXPIRING

Code of Ethics
We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including our Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers.  These standards are designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the highest ethical, moral and legal conduct of all employees.  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on the investor relations section of our website at investors.presidio.com under "Corporate Governance" - "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics" and can be obtained, free of charge, at our Corporate Headquarters in our Human Resources Department.  The reference to our website address in this proxy statement does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this proxy statement.  We intend to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or waivers of these provisions with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller or persons performing similar functions, on our website or in our public filings with the SEC. Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that address the role and composition of, and policies applicable to, the Board.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will periodically review the guidelines and report any recommendations to the Board.  The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Company's website at investors.presidio.com under "Corporate Governance" - "Corporate Governance Guidelines."
Board Role in Risk Oversight
Risk assessment and oversight are integral parts of our governance and management processes.  Our Board encourages management to promote a culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations.  Management discusses strategic and operational risks at regular management meetings and conducts specific strategic planning and review sessions during the year that include a focused discussion and analysis of the risks facing us.  From time to time, senior management reviews these risks with our Board at regular board meetings as part of management presentations that focus on particular business functions, operations or strategies and presents the steps taken by management to address such risks.  Our Board does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through our Board as a whole, as well as through various standing committees of our Board that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight.
Board Leadership Structure
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer currently are held by one individual. Our Board appointed Mr. Cagnazzi to serve as Chairman of the Board as of November 8, 2017, based on the leadership qualities, management capability, knowledge of the business and industry, and a long-term, strategic perspective he has demonstrated as CEO over a period of over six years of running the Company.
Based on extensive review and consideration by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board, our Board believes a Board leadership structure composed of an executive Chairman and CEO is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at this time.  In line with its commitment to best practices, the Company will continue to review and assess Chairman succession planning, including the best leadership structure for the Board to account for the Company's evolving needs and business environment circumstances.
Policy for Director Recommendations
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, evaluating and recommending candidates to the Board for election as a director of the Company.  The Committee may use outside consultants to assist in identifying candidates, and will also consider advice and recommendations from stockholders, management, and others as it deems appropriate.
A stockholder that wants to recommend a candidate for election to the Board should send the recommendation in accordance with the procedures described in our bylaws.  See "Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations."  In its evaluation of director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees should have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees should have demonstrated business acumen, experience, and ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and long-term objectives of the Company and should be willing and able to contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees should have a commitment to understand the Company and its industry and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees should have the interest and ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the Company, which include stockholders, employees, customers, governmental units, creditors and the general public, and to act in the interests of all stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees should not have, nor appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all the Company's stockholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominees will not be discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other basis proscribed by law.  The value of diversity on the Board should be considered. 
[END TABLE]
The renomination of existing directors is not viewed as automatic, but will be based on continuing qualification under the criteria set forth above.  In addition, the committee will consider the existing directors' performance on the Board and any committee, which may include consideration of the extent to which the directors undertook continuing director education.  The backgrounds and qualifications of the directors considered as a group should provide a significant breadth of experience, knowledge and abilities that will assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider:  (i) any specific minimum qualifications that it believes must be met by a nominee for a position on the Board; (ii) any specific qualities or skills that it believes are necessary for one or more of the Board members to possess; and (iii) the desired qualifications, expertise and characteristics of Board members, with the goal of developing an experienced and highly qualified Board.  In making its recommendations, the committee will consider the number of other public company boards and other boards (or comparable governing bodies) on which a prospective nominee is a member, as well as his or her other professional responsibilities. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth certain information, as of the September 12, 2018 record date, regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock with respect to:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The amounts and percentages of common stock beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities.  Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares voting power, which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of such security, or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security.  A person is also deemed a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days.  Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing such person's ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other person's percentage.  Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest.  Except as otherwise indicated in these footnotes, each of the beneficial owners has, to our knowledge, sole voting and investment power with respect to the indicated shares of common stock.  In addition, except as otherwise indicated in these footnotes, the address of each of the directors and executive officers of the Company is c/o One Penn Plaza, Suite 2832, New York, New York 10119.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information regarding the objectives and elements of our compensation philosophy, policies, and practices with respect to the compensation of our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, and our three other most highly compensated executive officers (collectively, our "named executive officers"), for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"). 
Our named executive officers for fiscal 2018 were:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Paul Fletcher, our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  
[END TABLE]
Neil O. Johnston was appointed as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 16, 2018, replacing Paul Fletcher who retired on March 31, 2018 and served in a transitional role from January 16, 2018 through March 31, 2018. 
2017 Say on Pay Vote and 2017 Say on When Vote
At the 2017 annual stockholders meeting our stockholders voted, on an advisory basis, to approve the Board's recommended resolution with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers. Although non-binding, the Compensation Committee will take into account such approval, as applicable, when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
At the 2017 annual stockholders meeting, our stockholders also voted, on an advisory basis, to approve the Board's recommendation that future advisory votes regarding our named executive officer compensation be held once every three years. We have determined to follow the stockholder vote. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Commencing with the completion of our IPO in March 2017, the Compensation Committee of our Board has reviewed and approved the compensation of our named executive officers and oversees and administers our executive compensation programs and initiatives.  As our business develops over time, we expect that the specific direction, emphasis, and components of our executive compensation program will continue to evolve. Accordingly, the compensation paid to our named executive officers during fiscal 2018 is not necessarily indicative of how we will compensate our named executive officers in the future.
We have worked to create an executive compensation program that balances short- and long-term payments and awards, cash payments and equity awards, and fixed and contingent payments, and that rewards our named executive officers in ways that we believe are most appropriate to motivate them.  Our executive compensation program is designed to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain talented and experienced executives in our industry; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure fairness among the executive management team by recognizing the relative contributions each executive makes to our success; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• foster a shared commitment among executives by aligning their individual goals with the goals of the Company; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensate our executives in a manner that incentivizes them to manage our business to meet our long-range objectives without undue risk taking. 
[END TABLE]
 To achieve these objectives, we tie a substantial portion of the executives' overall compensation to key strategic financial and operational goals and shareholder value creation.  We seek to ensure that all incentives are aligned with our stated compensation philosophy of providing compensation commensurate with performance.
Setting Compensation
Role of Our Board, Compensation Committee and Named Executive Officers
Prior to our IPO, we were a privately held company.  As a result, most of our historical compensation policies and determinations reflected the priorities under that ownership structure.
Commencing with the completion of our IPO, the Compensation Committee oversees and administers our executive compensation arrangements, including the Presidio, Inc. Amended and Restated 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as our "2015 Plan"), the Presidio, Inc. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (which we refer to as our "2017 Plan"), the ESPP, and our Presidio, Inc. Executive Bonus Plan (which we refer to as our "Bonus Plan").
The Compensation Committee (excluding Mr. Cagnazzi) meets independently from our executives to consider appropriate compensation for our Chief Executive Officer.  For all other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee meets outside the presence of all executive officers, except our Chief Executive Officer.  Our Chief Executive Officer reviews annually each other named executive officer's performance with the Compensation Committee and recommends appropriate base salary, cash performance awards and grants of long-term equity incentive awards.  Based upon the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer and in consideration of the principles and objectives described above, the Compensation Committee approves the annual compensation packages of our named executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer.  The Compensation Committee annually analyzes our Chief Executive Officer's performance and determines his base salary, cash performance awards, and grants of long-term equity incentive awards based on its assessment of his performance with input from any consultants engaged by the Compensation Committee.
Role of Compensation Consultant and Market Analysis
The Compensation Committee retains Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") as its independent compensation consultant. Semler Brossy provided compensation advice independent of the Company's management. Semler Brossy was engaged to assist in developing an executive compensation program that will attract and retain executive talent, with a particular focus on employment agreements and long-term incentive compensation.  Semler Brossy's compensation advice during the prior fiscal year included a review of the Company's executive compensation philosophy, developing market compensation data for our employment agreements with executive officers, and advising the Board on equity grant allocations, annual and long-term incentive program design, and grant terms. 
Semler Brossy provided our Compensation Committee with certain market data for base salaries, total cash compensation (defined as actual base salary plus target short-term incentive compensation), total direct compensation (defined as target total cash compensation plus annualized value of long-term incentive grants), severance practices, and equity grants in connection with initial public offerings.  Semler Brossy also conducted market analyses based on both general survey data, an industry peer group, a general IPO peer group, and an information technology IPO peer group.  
For the industry peer group, Semler Brossy utilized data for companies with last-12 month revenues between $1 billion and $10 billion (this range represents companies roughly 1/3x to 3x the Company's size, in terms of revenue) and focused on technology distributors with consulting attributes.  The industry peer group analysis was based on a peer group of 11 publicly traded companies consisting of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
CDW Corporation Unisys Corporation 
CGI Group, Inc. PC Connection, Inc. 
Computer Sciences Corporation* E Plus Inc. 
Insight Enterprises, Inc. Black Box Corporation 
CRSA Inc. Datalink Corporation* 
CIBER, Inc.   
[END TABLE]
 *After the completion of the peer group study, Computer Sciences Corporation completed a merger with HP Enterprises Solution to create DXC Technology on April 3, 2017, and Datalink Corporation was acquired by Insight Enterprises on January 6, 2017.
Our Compensation Committee intends to continue to use peer group analysis to assess competitive pay.  Because our industry peer group was developed with Semler Brossy to provide market data for compensation plans and arrangements adopted in connection with our IPO, it may be re-evaluated by Semler Brossy and the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2019.
Risk Management
We have determined that any risks arising from our compensation programs and policies are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Company's compensation programs and policies for all employees mitigate risk by combining performance-based, long-term compensation elements with payouts that are highly correlated to the value delivered to stockholders.  The combination of performance measures for annual bonuses and the equity compensation programs, as well as the multi-year vesting schedules for equity awards and certain cash bonuses, encourages employees to maintain both a short- and a long-term view with respect to Company performance.
Elements of Compensation
Our current executive compensation program consists of the following components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual cash incentive awards linked to our overall performance and individual performance; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term equity-based compensation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other executive benefits and perquisites; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employment agreements, which contain severance benefits. 
[END TABLE]
We combine these elements to formulate compensation packages that provide competitive pay, reward the achievement of financial, operational, and strategic objectives and align the interests of our executive officers and other senior personnel with those of our stockholders.
Base Salary
Our named executive officers' base salaries depend on their position within the Company and its subsidiaries, the scope of their responsibilities, the period during which they have been performing those responsibilities, and their overall performance.  Base salaries are reviewed annually and are generally adjusted from time to time to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance, and experience. 
Annual Cash Incentive Awards 
Our named executive officers are hired to lead and grow our organization and as such we believe that a significant portion of our named executive officers' compensation should be tied to our overall performance.  We maintain an annual incentive cash bonus program for senior management (the "management incentive plan"), which emphasizes pay-for-performance by providing our named executive officers with the opportunity to earn an annual bonus based on company and individual performance goals established by our Board with respect to each fiscal year.
For fiscal 2018, our Board established company performance goals relating to Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as measured on an annual and quarterly basis. The Company selected these performance goals because it feels that these performance metrics combine to reflect our overall performance. In addition, for Messrs. Johnston, Fletcher, Hart, Thomas and Brecher, the Board also established individual performance goals. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus (i) total depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest and other (income) expense, and (iii) income tax expense, as further adjusted to eliminate noncash share-based compensation expense, purchase accounting adjustments, transaction costs and other costs. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Total Revenue. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, from net income for fiscal year 2018 is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(in millions)   June 30, 2018 
Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:     
Net income   $ 134.2   
Total depreciation and amortization (1)   89.5   
Interest and other (income) expense   60.5   
Income tax expense   (79.7) 
EBITDA   204.5   
Adjustments:     
Share-based compensation expense   7.0   
Purchase accounting adjustments (2)   0.3   
Transaction costs (3)   10.8   
Other costs (4)   1.1   
Total adjustments   19.2   
Adjusted EBITDA   $ 223.7   
Adjusted EBITDA% (5)   7.8% 
[END TABLE]
(1) Includes depreciation and amortization included within total operating expenses and cost of revenue.
(2) Includes noncash adjustments associated with purchase accounting (including inventory step up, deferred revenue step down and revaluation of deferred rent).
(3) Includes transaction-related expenses related to (i) stay and retention bonuses, (ii) transaction-related advisory and diligence fees, (iii) transaction-related legal, accounting and tax fees and (iv) professional fees and expenses associated with debt refinancings.
(4) Includes other expenses primarily related to severance charges associated with the retirement of our former Chief Financial Officer. 
(5) Adjusted EBITDA% represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Total Revenue (i.e., Adjusted EBITDA margin).
For each of our named executive officers, the target and maximum bonus opportunity under our management incentive plan, as well as the portion of their annual bonus attributable to company and individual performance goals, is set forth below. All of our Chief Executive Officer's annual cash incentive compensation, and a portion of each other named executive officer's annual cash incentive compensation, was tied to Company performance, in furtherance of our pay-for-performance philosophy and with the intent of driving operating performance. For each of our named executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of their annual cash incentive compensation was based on the achievement of individual performance targets, which are described in more detail below. The individual performance targets were set with the intent of driving business unit performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name   Target Bonus ($)  Maximum Bonus ($)  Company Performance (%)  Individual Performance (%)

(1)  Reflects Mr. Johnston's target bonus and maximum bonus on an annualized basis. His actual fiscal 2018 annual incentive bonus was calculated on a pro rata basis to reflect his appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 16, 2018.  
(2)  Mr. Fletcher's target bonus remained unchanged following his change from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to a transitional role effective January 16, 2018, and was prorated through March 31, 2018, his retirement date.  
[END TABLE]
For fiscal 2018, the company performance component for each of our named executive officers was based on Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin compared to budgeted amounts, calculated on a sliding scale, along with a quarterly accelerator based on Total Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.  Based on our results for  fiscal 2018, the target bonus for company performance was multiplied by 81% for Total Revenue, 50% for Adjusted EBITDA and 90% for Adjusted EBITDA margin, and the result was then multiplied by 103% based on quarterly performance.
For fiscal 2018, the Board considered the following factors in evaluating the individual performance component for each named executive officer:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Johnston, maintaining compliance on debt covenants and debt reduction targets, which was weighted at 25%; timely and accurate filings with the SEC, which was weighted at 25%; maintaining total selling, general and administrative expenses below target, which was weighted 25%; and maintaining certain general and administrative expenses below target, which was weighted 25%. 
[END TABLE]

• For Mr. Fletcher, maintaining compliance on debt covenants and debt reduction targets, which was weighted at 25%; timely and accurate filings with the SEC, which was weighted at 25%; maintaining total selling, general and administrative expenses below target, which was weighted 25%; and maintaining certain general and administrative expenses below target, which was weighted 25%. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Hart, achieving the cumulative targeted Adjusted EBITDA for cybersecurity, Presidio Technology Capital, Sequoia cloud solutions, Internet of Things ("IoT") and Contact Center business units, which was weighted at 80%; and achieving targeted renewal and attach rates on certain third party maintenance sales, which was weighted at 20%; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Brecher, managing SEC reporting requirements, which was weighted at 25%; standardizing our contracting process, which was weighted at 25%; development of an authority matrix, which was weighted 25%; and assisting with mergers and acquisitions activity, which was weighted 25%. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For Mr. Thomas, launching the Presidio Concierge tool, which was weighted at 40%; improving professional services utilization rates, which was weighted at 30%; implementing a software adoption team to drive certain software sales, which was weighted at 20%; conducting communication with key industry contacts, which was weighted at 5%; and hosting key annual events within budget, which was weighted at 5%. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the applicable levels of achievement described above, payments to our named executive officers under the management incentive plan for fiscal 2018 were as follows:

[END TABLE]
The Bonus Plan is intended to provide an incentive for superior work and to motivate eligible executives of the Company toward even greater achievement and business results, to tie their goals and interests to those of ours and our stockholders, and to enable us to attract and retain highly qualified executives.  Under the Bonus Plan, we may pay bonuses (including discretionary  bonuses) to key executives, including our named executive officers, based upon such terms and conditions as our Board or Compensation Committee may in its discretion determine.
Long-Term Equity-Based Compensation
Our Board believes that equity-based compensation is an important component of our executive compensation program and that providing a significant portion of our executive officers' total compensation package in equity-based compensation aligns the incentives of our executives with the interests of our stockholders and with our long-term corporate success.  Additionally, our Board believes that equity-based compensation awards enable us to attract, motivate, retain, and adequately compensate executive talent.
To that end, we have awarded equity-based compensation in the form of stock options.  Our Board believes equity awards provide executives with a significant long-term interest in our success by rewarding the creation of stockholder value over time. In addition, stock options align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders, as the intrinsic value of the options will depend upon the increase in the value of our stock following a grant and will have no intrinsic value in the event the stock price declines following a grant. 
Prior to the completion of our IPO, we did not grant equity compensation on an annual basis. Instead, we generally granted equity compensation for retention and recognition purposes in connection with major corporate events. In addition, we also granted equity compensation to new hires and in connection with promotions.  
In connection with the completion of the IPO, we granted stock options to certain employees, including certain named executive officers, and it was contemplated at that time by the Compensation Committee that we would begin making annual grants of equity compensation in 2018, with ongoing annual grants every 12 months thereafter. Accordingly, in August 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a long-term incentive stock option program that is expected to utilize the unused shares reserved under the 2017 Plan over a two-year period. The Compensation Committee will then assess whether the existing option plan is competitive and implement any necessary changes as well as seek stockholder approval for an additional share pool for future equity awards.
In fiscal 2019, as part of the stock option program described above, we granted stock options under the 2017 Plan to certain employees, including our current named executive officers, each with a fair market value exercise price. The number of options granted to our named executive officers is as follows: Mr. Cagnazzi - 300,000; Mr. Hart - 150,000; Mr. Johnston - 113,000; Mr. Brecher - 75,000; and Mr. Thomas - 100,000. The options vest in four equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the named executive officer's continued service through such vesting date.  The maximum term of these options is 10 years following the date of grant.  The options vest, in whole or in part, upon a termination without cause, resignation with good reason, or upon the executive officer's death, disability or retirement, in each case, as described under "— Termination and Change of Control Arrangements."
Employment Agreements
As described below under "— Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers," during fiscal 2017, in connection with the completion of the IPO, we entered into employment agreements with certain named executive officers that superseded their employment agreements and offer letters that were previously in effect. And as described under "— Chief Financial Officer Transition," in January 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Johnston. Our employment agreements are designed to encourage and reinforce the continued attention and dedication of our named executive officers to their assigned duties without undue concern regarding their job security.
Chief Financial Officer Transition
In connection with the hiring of Mr. Johnston as Chief Financial Officer, the Compensation Committee approved entering into an employment agreement and offer letter agreement with Mr. Johnston on January 16, 2018 which entitled him (1) an annual base salary of $600,000, (2) a target annual bonus opportunity of $500,000 (pro-rated for fiscal year 2018), (3) a sign-on stock option grant to purchase 112,600 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $17.74, which vest in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the grant date, (4) an annual discretionary stock option grant to purchase 40,000 shares, subject to approval of the Board and (5) certain relocation benefits, including temporary housing assistance for four months and expense reimbursement in accordance with the terms of Mr. Johnston's employment agreement. Mr. Johnston is also entitled to certain benefits upon a termination without cause, a resignation with good reason or a non-renewal of his employment agreement by the Company, as described below under "Termination and Change in Control Arrangements — Employment Agreements." In connection with his retirement, Mr. Fletcher entered into a transition agreement with the Company on January 16, 2018 that provided for the following benefits, among others: (1) Mr. Fletcher's title was Vice President, Finance and he provided transition services as an employee of the Company until his retirement date on March 31, 2018, (2) his retirement was treated as a termination without cause for purposes of severance benefits under his employment agreement with the Company, dated as of September 30, 2010, (3) he received additional cash payments totaling $105,600 and a prorated bonus for the 2018 fiscal year based on actual performance, and (4) 64,800 options with an exercise price of $5.00 vested and 162,000 options with an exercise price of $5.00 will remain outstanding until March 31, 2020 and remain eligible to vest based on the achievement of applicable performance targets.
Limited Benefits and Perquisites
We provide the following benefits to our executive officers on the same basis as other eligible employees:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• health, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a qualified 401(k) savings plan (which includes a fixed matching contribution equal to 33% of the employee's elective deferrals on up to 6% of compensation subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")); and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vacation, personal holidays, and sick days.  
[END TABLE]
We believe these benefits are generally consistent with those offered by other companies and specifically with those companies with which we compete for employees.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In connection with the consummation of the IPO, we adopted the ESPP.  The ESPP permits employees to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions during quarterly offerings periods, or during such other offering periods as the Compensation Committee may determine. Under the terms of the ESPP, the purchase price per share currently is equal to 95% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the last day of each offering period. Beginning with the next quarterly offering period, the purchase price per share will be equal to 90% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the last day of each offering period. 
Tax Gross Ups
Named executive officers are not entitled to any "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up payments under any plan or agreement with the Company. 
Hedging Policy
Pursuant to our insider trading policy, our executive officers who are required to comply with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions.
 No Repricing
Our 2017 Plan prohibits repricing underwater stock options.
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deduction of public companies for compensation in excess of $1.0 million, and prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), paid to their chief executive officer and the three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) at the end of any fiscal year, unless the compensation qualifies as "performance-based compensation" subject to certain criteria. Section 162(m) was amended by the TCJA which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA modifies (1) the definition of "covered employee" by including the Chief Financial Officer, (2) provides that any covered employee for taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016 will remain a covered employee subject to Section 162(m) for all future years, and (3) removed the "performance-based compensation" exception. These changes do not apply to compensation stemming from contracts entered into on or before November 2, 2017 or for compensation exempt under the transition rule for newly public companies described below, until its expiration. Going forward, although "performance-based" criteria is no longer relevant in determining whether  remuneration is deductible for tax purposes, our compensation committee intends to continue to apply such criteria in structuring future compensation arrangements. 
Our compensation committee's policy with respect to Section 162(m) is to make a reasonable effort to cause compensation to be deductible by us while simultaneously providing our executive officers with appropriate rewards for their performance.  However, our compensation committee may approve compensation or changes to plans, programs or awards that may cause the compensation or awards to exceed the limitation under Section 162(m) if it determines that such action is appropriate and in our best interests. Compensation paid or granted during the "transition period" to our executive officers under a plan or agreement existing prior to the Company's IPO is not subject to the limitations on deductions imposed by Section 162(m) to the extent it qualifies under the transition relief of Section 162(m) for newly public companies.

Option Awards
Under our 2015 Plan, unvested time-based options will become fully vested upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company.

The terms of the option awards that have been granted to our named executive officers to date under our 2017 Plan provide that:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Upon the named executive officer's retirement, the named executive officer will become vested such that the total number of options that are vested is equal to the excess, if any, of (1) the product of (a) the total number of shares subject to the option award, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days between the grant date and the date of retirement and the denominator of which is the number of days between the grant date and the fourth anniversary of the grant date, over (2) any options previously exercised under the option award by the named executive officer prior to his retirement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vested options will be forfeit upon a termination with cause, remain exercisable for one year following the named executive officer's death or disability, remain exercisable for three years upon the named executive officer's retirement, and remain exercisable for 90 days following any other termination of employment. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event of a change in control in which the acquirer of the Company assumes the options, the options will vest in full upon a termination without cause, resignation for good reason, or death or disability during the two years following a change in control. 
[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements
In connection with the IPO, we entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Cagnazzi, Hart, Thomas and Brecher, which superseded their prior employment agreements and offer letters and provide for severance payments and benefits upon certain qualifying terminations of employment as described below. In January 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mr. Johnston.
Upon a termination without cause or a resignation with good reason or a non-renewal of the named executive officer's employment agreement, each such named executive officer would be entitled to, subject to the named executive officer's execution of a release of claims, (1) an amount equal to a multiple (2.0 for Mr. Cagnazzi (2.5 if such termination of employment occurs during the two-year period following a change in control) and 1.5 for Messrs. Hart, Johnston and Thomas) of the sum of (a) his annual base salary in effect immediately prior to such termination of employment and (b) his annual bonus earned for the fiscal year prior to such termination of employment (or, if such termination of employment occurs during the two-year period following a change in control, his target annual bonus in effect immediately prior to the change in control), paid over a period of months (24 for Mr. Cagnazzi (30 if such termination of employment occurs during the two-year period following a change in control) and 18 for Messrs. Thomas, Johnston and Hart) following such termination of employment, (2) a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination of employment occurs, based on actual performance (or target performance if such termination of employment occurs during the two-year period following a change in control) and paid at the time the Company pays annual bonuses to executive officers for such fiscal year, and (3) a lump sum cash payment equal to the cost of the monthly premiums for medical and dental coverage for a period of months (24 for Mr. Cagnazzi and 18 for Messrs. Thomas, Johnston and Hart).
Upon a termination without cause or a resignation with good reason or a non-renewal of Mr. Brecher's employment, Mr. Brecher would be entitled to, subject to his execution of a release of claims, (1) an amount equal to his annual base salary in effect immediately prior to such termination of employment, and, if such termination of employment occurs during the two-year period following a change in control, his target annual bonus, in each case, paid in equal installments over a 12-month period following such termination of employment; (2) a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination of employment occurs, based on actual performance (or, if such termination occurs during the two-year period following a change in control, target performance) and paid at the time the Company pays annual bonuses to executive officers for such fiscal year; and (3) a lump sum cash payment equal to the cost of the monthly premiums for medical and dental coverage for a period of 12 months.
Upon a termination without cause or a resignation with good reason or a non-renewal of each named executive officer's employment agreement during the six-month period prior to a change in control but after the date a definitive transaction agreement is executed that contemplates such change in control, such named executive officer's employment will be deemed to have terminated upon the change in control and the amount of any severance that would have been payable had the named executive officer been terminated as of the date of the change in control will be paid in equal installments over the balance of the severance period.
Upon a termination of employment due to death or disability, each such named executive officer would be entitled to (1) a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination of employment occurs, based on actual performance and paid at the time the Company pays annual bonuses to executive officers for such fiscal year and (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to the cost of the monthly premiums for medical and dental coverage for a period of months (24 for Mr. Cagnazzi, 18 for Messrs. Thomas, Johnston and Hart and 12 for Mr. Brecher).
Upon a retirement, each such executive officer would be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination of employment occurs, based on actual performance and paid at the time the Company pays annual bonuses to executive officers for such fiscal year.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control in Fiscal 2018
The following table sets forth potential payments to each of our named executive officers in the event of the listed events, calculated under the assumption that the executive officer's employment terminated on June 30, 2018, the last day of our most recently completed fiscal year.  The following table does not include payments pursuant to contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements that do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation, in favor of executive officers and that are generally available to all salaried employees.  The following table includes payments and benefits under the current employment agreements, which were in effect as of June 30, 2018, that would become payable if the applicable termination or change in control event occurred as of June 30, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio
The following information about the relationship between the compensation of our employees and the compensation of Robert Cagnazzi, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, is provided in compliance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Item 402(u)"). In fiscal 2018, our last completed fiscal year, the estimated median of the annual total compensation of our employees, excluding Robert Cagnazzi, was $95,000. This amount was calculated in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-K for reporting total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. Robert Cagnazzi's total compensation for fiscal 2018, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 31 of this proxy statement, was $605,755. The resulting estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of Robert Cagnazzi to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 6.38x to 1.
The following paragraphs provide important context related to our employee population and describe the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to calculate this ratio.
As of June 30, 2018, Presidio's workforce consisted of approximately 2,900 individuals worldwide, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees which we used for purposes of determining the compensation of our median employee.
We next identified the employee receiving the median amount of compensation in our employee population, excluding Robert Cagnazzi. To do this we compared the amount of taxable income received by each such employee, as derived from our tax records, as of the most recently completed fiscal year because we believe this measure reasonably reflects the annual compensation of our employees. The compensation measure was annualized for permanent employees who were employed on June 30, 2018 but who did not work for the full calendar year. The compensation measure was consistently applied to all our employees. As required by Item 402(u) and as indicated above, once we identified our median employee we measured that employee's annual total compensation for the 2018 fiscal year by adding together the same elements of compensation that are included in Robert Cagnazzi's total fiscal 2018 compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 31. Please see "—Summary Compensation Table."
The resulting pay ratio was calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) and we believe it constitutes a reasonable estimate. However, as contemplated by Item 402(u), we relied on methods and assumptions that we determined to be appropriate for calculating the pay ratio at Presidio. Other public companies will use methods and assumptions that differ from the ones we chose but are appropriate for their circumstances. It may therefore be difficult, for this and other reasons, to compare our reported pay ratio to pay ratios reported by other companies. PROPOSAL 2 - RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.  Although stockholder ratification of the Audit Committee's action in this respect is not required, the Audit Committee considers it desirable for stockholders to ratify such appointment.  If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP, the engagement of independent auditors will be reevaluated by the Audit Committee.
Representatives of RSM US LLP are expected to attend the meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
Fees paid or accrued for professional services provided by our independent auditors for each of the last two fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, in each of the following categories are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2017   2018 
Audit fees   $ 885,648     $ 1,250,560   
All other fees   —     84,200   
Total   $ 885,648     $ 1,334,760   
[END TABLE]
Audit fees consist of fees incurred for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, review of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, services rendered in connection with our registration statements on Form S-1 and Form S-8 related to our IPO and services that are normally provided by RSM US LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. All other fees consist of fees incurred for compilation services. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services.  All audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  Unless the specific service has been previously pre-approved with respect to that year, the Audit Committee must approve the permitted service before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to perform it.  The Audit Committee uses the following procedures in pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.  At or before the first meeting of the Audit Committee each year, the Audit Committee is presented with a detailed listing of the individual audit and non-audit services and fees (separately describing audit-related services, tax services and other services) expected to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm during the year.  Quarterly, the Audit Committee is presented with an update of any new audit and non-audit services to be provided.  The Audit Committee reviews the Company's update and approves the services outlined therein if such services are acceptable to the Audit Committee.
Non-audit services that constitute less than 5% of the revenues paid by the Company to the independent registered public accounting firm may be approved by the Audit Committee (or one or more members authorized by the Audit Committee) after the services are commenced but before the completion of the audit, provided that such services were not recognized by the Company at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services and such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more of its members the authority to pre-approve permissible non-audit services, so long as this pre-approval is presented to the full Audit Committee at scheduled meetings.  The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority of up $100,000 in between scheduled Audit Committee meetings to the chairman of the Audit Committee, and the chairman is required to report any such pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.  In addition, the Audit Committee has granted Neil Johnston, our Chief Financial Officer, authority to approve non-audit services of up to $100,000 in between scheduled Committee meetings upon notice in each instance to the Audit Committee chairman, subject to confirmation of the approval of such services by the Audit Committee at the next scheduled meeting.
All RSM US LLP services and fees during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
The Board recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP. AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee, which is composed of three directors (Todd H. Siegel (Chairman), Steven Lerner and Pankaj Patel), operates under a written charter adopted by the Board.  Among its functions, the committee selects the independent auditors.
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls, and the independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon.  The committee's responsibility is to oversee the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board and to report the result of their activities to the Board.
In this context, the committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent auditors.  Management represented to the committee that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management and the independent auditors.  The committee discussed with the independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees.
The independent auditors also provided to the committee the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and the committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors' independence.
Based upon the committee's discussion with management and the independent auditors and the committee's review of the representation of management and the report of the independent auditors to the committee, and relying thereon, the committee recommended that the Board include the audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Audit Committee of the Board 
Todd H. Siegel (Chairman)

Pankaj Patel CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Parties
The Board has adopted a written related parties transactions policy. The Audit Committee reviews transactions that may be "related party transactions," which are transactions between Presidio and related parties in which the aggregate amount is expected to exceed $120,000 and in which a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. For purposes of the policy, a related party is a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or a greater than 5% beneficial owner of Presidio's common stock, in each case since the beginning of the last fiscal year, their immediate family members or any firm, corporation or other entity controlled by any such person. Pursuant to the policy, certain categories of transactions, such as the payment of director or executive compensation or ordinary course transactions involving the provision of certain financial services, such as escrow agency, bank depository or other similar services, are deemed pre-approved.
Certain Transactions with Related Parties
There have been no transactions since July 1, 2017 to which we have been a participant in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than five percent of our capital stock, or any members of their immediate family, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation arrangements which are described under "Executive Compensation" and "Director Compensation," and other than the transactions described below.  For a description of severance and change of control arrangements that we have entered into with our executive officers, see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Executive Compensation - Termination and Change in Control Agreements" and "- Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control in Fiscal 2018."
Apollo Stockholders Agreement
In connection with the IPO, on March 10, 2017 we entered into a stockholders agreement with Aegis LP (the "Apollo Stockholders Agreement"), the Apollo entity that holds most of our common stock, which provides that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, if Aegis LP or the Apollo Funds hold (a) at least 50% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to five nominees to our Board, (b) at least 30% but less than 50% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to four nominees to our Board, (c) at least 20% but less than 30% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate up to three nominees to our Board and (d) at least 10% but less than 20% of our outstanding common stock, they will have the right to designate two nominees to our Board.  The Apollo Stockholders Agreement also provides that if the size of our Board is increased or decreased at any time, the nomination rights of Aegis LP and the Apollo Funds will be proportionately increased or decreased, respectively, and rounded up to the nearest whole number.
Under the Apollo Stockholders Agreement, the approval of a majority of the members of our Board, which must include the approval of a majority of the directors nominated by Aegis LP or the Apollo Funds, is required under certain circumstances.  These include, as to us and, to the extent applicable, each of our subsidiaries:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other than in the ordinary course of business with vendors, customers and suppliers, entering into any (a) acquisition by us or any of our subsidiaries of the equity interests or assets of any person, or the acquisition by us or any of our subsidiaries of any business, properties, assets, or persons or (b) disposition of our assets or the assets of any of our subsidiaries or the shares or other equity interests of any of our subsidiaries, in each case where the amount of consideration for any such acquisition or disposition exceeds $100 million in any single transaction, or an aggregate amount of $200 million in any series of transactions during a calendar year; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• incurring financial indebtedness, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, aggregating to more than $75 million, subject to certain exceptions;

These approval rights will terminate at such time as the Apollo Funds no longer beneficially own at least 30% of our outstanding common stock.
Amended Management Stockholders Agreement
The Company, Aegis LP, the Apollo entity that holds most of our common stock, and certain of our employees who invested in the Company in connection with our acquisition by the Apollo Funds in February 2015 are parties to a securityholders agreement.  Pursuant to the securityholders agreement, Aegis LP and certain of its affiliates have certain demand registration rights for shares of our common stock held by them.  In addition, Aegis LP, certain of its affiliates and the Management Holders have piggyback and other registration rights with respect to shares of our common stock held by them.  Furthermore, we agree to indemnify (A) each party to the securityholders agreement and their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and each person who controls such party, (B) Aegis LP and its officers, managers, employees, representatives and affiliates and (C) any portfolio company of the Apollo Group against losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement or prospectus or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same may be caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to our Company by such party set forth in (A), (B) or (C) above for use therein.
Office Lease Agreement
The Company is party to a lease agreement with an entity owned by Christopher Cagnazzi, our President of the Presidio Tri State region, and Robert Cagnazzi, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, for office space located at 110 Parkway Drive South, Hauppauge, New York, which will expire on December 31, 2019.  The current annual rent under the lease is $0.3 million and is subject to a 3% annual escalation.
Other Related Party Transactions
We recorded revenue to parties affiliated with Apollo or our directors of $1.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding receivables associated with parties affiliated with Apollo or our directors were $1.7 million. 
One of our directors, Matthew Nord, is a senior partner of Apollo Global Management, LLC, which he joined in 2003.  One of our directors, Christopher Edson, is a partner of Apollo Global Management, LLC, which he joined in 2008.  One of our directors, Salim Hirji, is a principal of Apollo Global Management, LLC, which he joined in 2013.  One of our directors, Heather Berger, is a partner of Apollo Global Management, LLC, which she joined in 2008. One of our directors, Michael Reiss, is a partner of Apollo Global Management, LLC, which he joined in 2008. Information with respect to director compensation is set forth in this proxy statement, under "Election of Directors - Director Compensation."
Indemnification Agreements
In connection with the IPO, on March 9, 2017 we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers.  These indemnification agreements provide the directors and officers with contractual rights to indemnification and expense advancement that are, in some cases, broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law. 
Stock Buyback
On September 6, 2018, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement (the "Stock Repurchase Agreement") with Aegis LP. Pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Agreement, the Company agreed to repurchase 10,750,000 shares of our common stock from Aegis LP for aggregate consideration of approximately $160 million, representing a purchase price of $14.75 per share of common stock (the "Repurchase"). To fund the Repurchase, the Company used proceeds of $160 million of additional term  loans under an incremental term loan B facility established pursuant to our Senior Credit Facility. The Stock Repurchase Agreement, the Repurchase and the related transactions were approved by our Board and a committee of independent directors.       SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own beneficially more than 10% of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to file copies of such reports with us.  Based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports received by us and written representations that no other reports were required, other than the late filing of initial reports on Form 3 by Heather Berger and Michael Reiss in connection with their joining our Board, we believe that during our fiscal year ended June  30, 2018, such reporting persons complied with the filing requirements of said Section 16(a). ANNUAL REPORT
Our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 will be made available to stockholders at the same time as this proxy statement.

If any of these events occurs, we will furnish the new dates for submission of proposed nominees or other items of business by public disclosure, including filing with the SEC of a current report on Form 8-K.
