PROPOSAL I
APPROVAL OF A NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE TRUST AND MERCATOR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC.
Background
The Fund's current investment adviser, Belpointe Asset Management, LLC ("BAM"), has served in such capacity since inception of the Fund, pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Trust (the "Current Advisory Agreement"). Mercator Investment Management, LLC ("Mercator" or the "Adviser") is owned in equal shares by Mercator, LLC, an entity owned by Herve van Caloen, the Fund's portfolio manager and by Belpointe Financial Holdings, LLC. Mr. van Caloen has served as the portfolio manager since inception and will remain portfolio manager. 
At a meeting on October 19, 2018, the Board of Trustees approved the Proposed Advisory Agreement  between the Trust, on behalf of the Fund, and Mercator, subject to shareholder approval. At the Board meeting, the Trustees approved the termination of the Current Advisory Agreement, such termination to be concurrent with the effective date of the Proposed Advisory Agreement.
Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), it is unlawful for any person to serve or act as an investment adviser of a registered investment company, except pursuant to a written contract, which contract has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities. The transaction, as described above, is presumed to require shareholder approval due to the change in an investment advisers. In order for Mercator to serve as the investment adviser to the Fund, the Trustees are requesting that shareholders approve a new investment advisory agreement with Mercator (the "Proposed Advisory Agreement"). Approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement will not raise the investment advisory fee or overall fees paid by the Fund or the Fund's shareholders. Mercator believes the transaction will not result in any interruption or decrease in the quality of services. 
 The 1940 Act requires that investment advisory agreements such as the Proposed Advisory Agreement be approved by a vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund. Therefore, shareholders are being asked to approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement with Mercator.  
The proposed change to the Fund's management structure will shift management oversight responsibility for the Fund from BAM to Mercator. By engaging Mercator as the adviser to the Fund, the Fund will continue to be advised by the same portfolio manager that currently advises the Fund.  
Current Advisory Agreement and Proposed Advisory Agreement  
The Proposed Advisory Agreement is attached as Exhibit A. You should read the Proposed Advisory Agreement.  The description in this Proxy Statement of the Proposed Advisory Agreement is only a summary. 
The Current Advisory Agreement and the Proposed Advisory Agreement are identical except for the effective date, the annual fee, and the adviser. 
Under the terms of the Current Advisory Agreement, BAM is entitled to receive an annual fee from the Fund equal to 1.19% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Under the terms of the Proposed Advisory Agreement, Mercator is entitled to receive an annual fee from the Fund equal to 0.84% of the Fund's average daily net assets.   For such compensation, Mercator, at its expense, continuously furnishes an investment program for the Fund, makes investment decisions on behalf of the Fund, and places all orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, subject to the Fund's investment objectives, policies, and restrictions and such policies as the Trustees may determine.
The Proposed Advisory Agreement provides that it will continue in force for an initial period of two years, and from year to year thereafter, but only so long as its continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the Board or (ii) a vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, provided that in either event continuance is also approved by a majority of the Independent Trustees, by a vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting such approval.  The Proposed Advisory Agreement automatically terminates on assignment and is terminable on not more than 60 days' notice by the Fund.  In addition, the New Agreement may be terminated upon 60 days' notice by Mercator given to the Fund

Evaluation by the Board of Trustees  
Nature, Extent and Quality of Service.  In evaluating whether to approve the Proposed Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality of services to be provided under the agreement. Although the Adviser is newly registered, the Board noted that the portfolio manager serves as the portfolio manager to the Fund under the current investment adviser. The Board evaluated the compliance program developed by the Adviser. The Board noted the Adviser's intention not to make any changes to the Fund's investment objectives or strategy. The Board concluded it was comfortable that the Adviser had the capabilities to oversee the operations of the Fund. Based on their review, the Trustees concluded that, overall, the nature, extent and quality of services expected to be provided to the Fund were satisfactory.
Performance.  The Board discussed the limited performance history of the Adviser. Although the Adviser was recently organized,  the Board expressed confidence in the Adviser's portfolio manager, Mr. Herve van Caloen. The Board noted that Mr. van Caloen served as the portfolio manager for the current adviser, and will continue to serve as the portfolio manager for the Adviser. The Board noted the Fund's performance while Mr. van Caloen's served as portfolio manager, and that the Fund had outperformed the Fund's Morningstar category since its inception. 
Fees and Expenses.  The Trustees reviewed information regarding fees charged by advisers to a peer group of funds with investment objectives and strategies comparable to the Fund's. The Trustees noted that the proposed advisory fee of 0.84% was less than  the Fund's current advisory fee and was slightly less was less than the peer group average. The Trustees remarked that the proposed advisory fee was lower than Morningstar Peer Group Foreign Small/Mid Blend category. The Trustees also considered that the Adviser had agreed to maintain the Fund's current expense limitation of 1.19% of Institutional Class shares' net assets. After further discussion, the Board concluded that the proposed advisory fee of 0.84% was reasonable.
Economies of Scale.  The Trustees considered whether the Adviser will realize economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund. The Trustees agreed that meaningful economies of scale had not yet been reached due to the limited operation of the Fund. The Trustees agreed to continue to monitor Fund growth and evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints in the advisory fee as Fund assets increase. 
Profitability.  The Trustees considered the projected profits by the Adviser in connection with the operation of the Fund for the first two years under the Proposed Advisory Agreement and whether the amount of profit would be a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the Fund. The Trustees noted that the Adviser expected to receive a marginal profit both in terms of percentage of revenue and dollar amount over both years. The Board concluded that the Adviser's estimated level of profitability from its relationship with the Fund was not excessive.
Conclusion. Having requested and received such information from the Adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Proposed Advisory Agreement, and as assisted by the advice of counsel, the Board concluded that the advisory fee is reasonable and that approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement is in the best interests of the shareholders of the Fund.
The Board of Trustees of the Trust, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders of the Fund vote "FOR" approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement. OTHER INFORMATION

 THE PROXY
The Board of Trustees solicits proxies so that each shareholder has the opportunity to vote on the proposal to be considered at the Meeting. A proxy for voting your shares at the Meeting is enclosed. The shares represented by each valid proxy received in time will be voted at the meeting as specified. If no specification is made, the shares represented by a duly executed proxy will be voted for approval of the Proposed Advisory Agreement and at the discretion of the holders of the proxy on any other matter that may come before the meeting that the Trust did not have notice of a reasonable time prior to the mailing of this Proxy Statement. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (1) submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, (2) submitting a written notice to the President of the Trust revoking the proxy, or (3) attending and voting in person at the Meeting. 
VOTING SECURITIES AND VOTING
As of the Record Date, there were 585,244 shares of beneficial interest of the Fund issued and outstanding.
All shareholders of record of the Fund on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Meeting on Proposal I. Each shareholder is entitled to one (1) vote per share held, and fractional votes for fractional shares held, on any matter submitted to a vote at the Meeting.  
An affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund is required for the approval of Proposal I. As defined in the 1940 Act, a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund means the vote of (1) 67% or more of the voting shares of the Fund present at the meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are present in person or represented by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting shares of the Fund, whichever is less.  
Broker non-votes and abstentions will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum and the number of shares of the Fund represented at the meeting, but they are not affirmative votes for any proposal. As a result, with respect to approval of the Proposal I, non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal because the required vote is a percentage of the shares present or outstanding.

In addition, the Adviser shall not seek satisfaction of any such obligations from the Trustees or any individual Trustee. The Adviser understands that the rights and obligations of any Fund under the Declaration of Trust are separate and distinct from those of any and all other Funds. The Adviser further understands and agrees that no Fund of the Trust shall be liable for any claims against any other Fund of the Trust and that the Adviser must look solely to the assets of the pertinent Fund of the Trust for the enforcement or satisfaction of any claims against the Trust with respect to that Fund.
