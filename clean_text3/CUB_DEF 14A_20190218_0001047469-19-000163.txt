 Proxy Statement  
We encourage your personal attendance. 
Proxies in the form enclosed and/or as shown at www.proxyvote.com are solicited by the Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in San Diego, California, on February 18, 2019, and at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. Execution of a proxy will not in any way affect a shareholder's right to attend the meeting and vote in person, and any shareholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before it is exercised, by filing with the Secretary of Cubic Corporation ("Cubic" or the "Company") a written revocation or duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the meeting and voting in person. The proxy will be suspended if the shareholder is present at the meeting and elects to vote in person. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to Be Held on February 18, 2019.
This proxy statement and our Annual Report are available electronically at www.proxyvote.com. 
Table of Contents 
    OUTSTANDING SHARES AND VOTING RIGHTS
A quorum of shareholders is required. A quorum exists if a majority of the common shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote are represented by shareholders present at the meeting or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. 31,132,991 shares of our common stock were outstanding at December 19, 2018, which is the record date for voting. 
Each holder of common shares is entitled to one vote for each share. Votes will be counted by the Inspector of Elections. Abstentions will be counted towards the vote total for each proposal, and will have the same effect as "Against" votes. Advisory votes are not binding, but the Board will consider the outcome of such votes when making future decisions. 
If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide specific voting instructions to your broker, we expect that the organization that holds your shares will not be authorized to vote your shares, which would result in "broker non-votes," on proposals other than Proposal 5 ratifying the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent public accountant for 2019. However, whether brokers have discretion to vote on matters is ultimately up to the New York Stock Exchange (which regulates certain banks, brokers and other nominees), and the New York Stock Exchange may make a determination that is different from what we expect to be the case. If that occurs, brokers may be able to vote your shares on matters on which we do not expect them to have discretion to vote. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to submit your proxy and exercise your right to vote as a shareholder to ensure your shares are voted in the manner in which you want them voted. 
Broker non-votes count to determine a quorum but otherwise have no effect and are not counted towards the vote total for any proposal; however, for Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d), broker non-votes will have the same effect as "Against" votes. Proxies without authority to vote will also not be counted in votes cast. In Proposal 1, nominees for Director are to be elected by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in favor of such nominee's election. Any incumbent nominee for Director who does not receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in favor of such nominee must promptly tender his or her resignation after the Annual Meeting. Proposals 2 and 4 require an affirmative vote of a majority of shares having voting power, present in person or represented by proxy. Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d) each require an affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (662/3%) of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting. 
There are no rights of appraisal or similar rights of dissenters with respect to any matter to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
The approximate date on which the proxy statement and form of proxy are first being sent to shareholders is January 18, 2019. 
    OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 19, 2018 for:
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Under these rules, beneficial ownership of a class of capital stock includes any shares of such class as to which a person, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting power or investment power and also any shares as to which a person has the right to acquire such voting or investment power within 60 days through the exercise of any options, warrants or other rights. Shares subject to options, warrants or other rights are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owners identified in this table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown below. 
For the purpose of calculating the percentage of shares beneficially owned by any shareholder, this table lists applicable percentage ownership based on 31,132,991 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 19, 2018. 
Unless otherwise indicated below, the address for each named director and executive officer is c/o Cubic Corporation, 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123.

The material in this report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
The committee selected Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accountants ("Accountants") of the Company for fiscal year 2018. The committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the Accountants the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The committee met with the Accountants on numerous occasions and discussed the matters required to be discussed under generally accepted auditing standards and the matters listed in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") AS 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), and has received from the Accountants the written disclosures and the letter required by the PCAOB (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), and has discussed with the Accountants their independence. 
Based on its review of the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 and its discussions with management and the Accountants, the committee recommended to our Board that the 2018 audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Audit and Compliance Committee  Bruce G. Blakley, Chair  Maureen Breakiron-Evans  Edwin A. Guiles  Steven J. Norris  Dr. John H. Warner, Jr. 
   Executive Compensation Committee  
The Executive Compensation Committee members are Messrs. Guiles (Chair), Blakley, Admiral Hamby, General Melcher, who was appointed in February 2018, and Dr. Banerjee, who was appointed in September, 2018. The committee met twice during fiscal year 2018. Each of the members of the committee is independent as defined under Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
The committee's role is to establish and oversee the Company's executive compensation programs and to oversee the amounts set aside for annual bonus and profit sharing contributions. Members of the committee annually review and approve goals and objectives relevant to compensation for the executive officers and principal officers of principal subsidiaries, evaluate each executive's performance in light of those goals and objectives, and either as a committee or together with the other Independent Directors of the Board, determine and approve the executives' compensation based on that evaluation. 
   Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation  
During fiscal year 2018, none of the members serving on the Executive Compensation Committee served either as a director or as a member of the compensation committee of any other entity whose executive officers served either as a director or as a member of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company. Therefore, there were no "interlocks" with other companies within the meaning of the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. No member of the committee is a former or current officer or employee of Cubic or any of its subsidiaries. See also the section "Executive Compensation and Other Information" later herein. 
   Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members are Dr. Warner (Chair), Ms. Breakiron-Evans, Mr. Norris and General Melcher, who was appointed in February 2018. Each of the members of the committee is independent as defined under Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The committee met four times during fiscal year 2018. The committee's policy is to consider Board candidate recommendations of shareholders which are received by the Corporate Secretary at least 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the mailing of notice of the previous annual meeting of shareholders. In considering additions to the Board or filling vacancies, the committee assesses current needs of the Company and considers candidates' expertise, experience, background, ethnicity and gender. In such circumstance, the committee seeks recommendations from the Board, senior management personnel and relevant professional organizations regarding potential candidates.

Table of Contents
BOARD COMMITTEES
The committee will also review any shareholder recommendations on file. The committee evaluates candidates submitted by shareholders using the same criteria as candidates identified by the Board, senior management personnel and other sources. The committee screens and personally interviews appropriate candidates. Selected candidates may meet with additional Board members, certain members of management and the Chair of the Board. The committee evaluates responses and recommends to the full Board the name of any candidate it feels should become a nominee for election or appointment. 
The committee conducted an extensive search for an additional director in fiscal year 2018, using criteria based on a matrix that set forth existing skills, experience and tenure and the qualities, skills and diversity sought in future candidates. The National Association of Corporate Directors assisted with identifying suitable candidates to present to the committee. Dr. Banerjee was recommended by the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
The governance responsibilities of the committee include tracking important legal and regulatory changes and new concepts in public company governance. Governance topics include annual Board, Board member and committee evaluations, Board composition, Board committee structure and Board refreshment as well as executive management and Board succession. 
The committee oversees the Board's annual self-evaluations and peer member evaluations with third party evaluations conducted every three years. Further, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines generally limit individual Board tenure to twelve years and/or the age of 75 years. These metrics are not absolute but are guidelines for maximums. When either of the individual maximums are reached, there must be compelling reasons for a director's continued participation on the Board. When both maximums are reached, there will be a strong presumption for transition off the Board.

   Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee  
The Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee members are Mr. Norris (Chair), Admiral Hamby and Dr. Warner. The committee met four times during fiscal year 2018.

Cubic has an internal Compliance Steering Committee ("CSC"), comprised of senior leaders with a wide variety of subject-matter expertise and authority, led by the Vice President of Compliance, reporting to the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee.

   Technology Strategy Committee  
The Technology Strategy Committee members are Dr. Banerjee, (Chair), Ms. Breakiron-Evans, Admiral Hamby and General Melcher. The committee was formed but did not hold its initial meeting during fiscal year 2018. Each of the members of the committee is independent as defined under Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
The Committee was formed in September 2018 for the purpose of assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of Cubic's technology directions and cyber resilience consistent with Cubic's strategic plan, and its products, solutions and services plans in the Transportation and Defense Industries. 
The Committee provides advice on our digital strategy and reviews our research and development ("R&D") investments to ensure they support the competitiveness of our products and services. The Committee reviews the technical competencies within Cubic and advises on the R&D organization and structure to support the R&D investment. 
   Risk Management  
The Board reviews and approves the procedures adopted and conclusions reached by our Executive Management Committee ("EMC") and discusses with the General Counsel, who is responsible for the Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") process, and the CEO, the major risk exposures and the steps that have been taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
The EMC reviews and assesses perceived risks to the enterprise as a whole and its major subsidiaries. It works with relevant managers and develops mitigation and remediation plans. Periodic reports are brought to the attention of the Board by the General Counsel. 
We have an ERM process for the parent company and sub-groups for our business segments. Each group consists of its senior officers who meet periodically to identify, assess and rank the perceived severity of risks unique to their businesses. Appropriate mitigation plans and training are implemented. To date, the EMC has not identified any risks, capable of control, which it believes cannot be reasonably controlled or mitigated.

BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board's focus and concern is to identify, and ensure the Company has a plan to respond to, those few issues which could seriously impact our, or one of our material divisions' short or long-term ability to continue normal operations. 
In conjunction with the risk management review, the Board also addresses our legal compliance efforts in certain complex areas, such as export control, antitrust and foreign corrupt practices. 
   Board Leadership Structure  
The Board regularly considers the appropriate leadership structure of the Company and has concluded that the Company and its shareholders are best served by not having a formal policy on whether the same individual should serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. This flexibility allows the Board to elect the most appropriate director as Chairman, while maintaining the ability to separate the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles if necessary. 
Currently, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles are held by Mr. Feldmann. Mr. Zable served as Chairman until the February 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, when he left the Board. Following the meeting, the Board elected Mr. Feldmann Chairman. 
The Chairman has the authority to call meetings of the Board and presides at such meetings. He has primary responsibility for shaping Board agendas (in consultation with the Lead Independent Director) and will communicate with all directors on key issues and concerns outside of Board meetings. 
Mr. Guiles serves as Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director's duties include presiding at all meetings at which the Chairman is not present (including executive sessions of the independent directors), calling meetings of the independent directors, consulting with the Chairman, approving all Board meeting agendas, facilitating discussion among independent directors on key issues outside of Board meetings and performing such other duties as the Board may from time to time designate.

    PROPOSAL 2:   ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE   OFFICER COMPENSATION
The Board Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
The Board is seeking your approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and other related tables and disclosure. Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the compensation of Cubic's named executive officers during fiscal year 2018, as described in its proxy statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and other related tables and disclosure, is hereby approved."
This proposal, commonly known as "say-on-pay", gives you the opportunity to express your views on the Company's executive compensation practices. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Executive Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved our Executive Compensation policies by a strong majority, with approximately 94% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2018 Say-on-Pay resolution (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). We expect to bring a similar proposal to you at each annual meeting of shareholders. 
The Board believes that the Company's executive compensation policies are balanced, appropriately focused on pay for performance principles, aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders, and enable the Company to attract and retain experienced senior executives. 
As described more fully in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis herein, the Company's executive compensation program consists of three main components:
The Company evaluates executive officer compensation through multiple bases of review and evaluation to help our Executive Compensation Committee oversee an executive compensation program that is competitive yet closely tied to the Company's and each executive officer's performance. 
The Executive Compensation Committee reviews market survey compensation data for companies of comparable size and complexity. The Executive Compensation Committee also considers advice and recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer for executives other than himself. Additionally, the Company's annual bonus program and its long term equity incentive award program recognizes and rewards the success of executives who manage performance to achieve the short- and long-term goals set for them every year by the Company and the Executive Compensation Committee.

 Compensation Discussion and  Analysis  
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the Company's compensation philosophy and the objectives of the Company's compensation program for its executive officers, including the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table below (the "NEOs") and how the Executive Compensation Committee oversees the executive compensation program. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis also describes the compensation determination process for fiscal year 2018 and how each element of compensation was determined. 
 Review of Executive  Compensation Best Practices  
The Board believes that the Company's compensation policies and practices are aligned with good corporate governance:
 Overview and Objectives of  Executive Compensation  Program  
The Board recognizes that there is considerable public discussion regarding appropriate approaches to compensation. The Board believes that the Company's executive compensation policies are balanced, appropriately focused on pay for performance principles, aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders, and enable the Company to attract and retain experienced senior executives. 
As described more fully in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Company evaluates executive officer compensation in several different ways, including reviewing market survey compensation data, reviewing customized compensation information for companies of comparable size and complexity and receiving advice and recommendations from the CEO. These multiple bases of review and evaluation help our Executive Compensation Committee oversee an executive compensation program that is competitive yet tied to the Company's and each executive officer's performance. Additionally, the Company's annual performance bonus program recognizes and rewards the success of executives who manage performance to achieve the short-term goals set for them every year by the Company and the Executive Compensation Committee. 
We have three main elements in our executive compensation program: base salary, an annual performance bonus, and a long-term equity incentive award program for our executive officers. The long-term equity incentive award program includes RSUs that vest based on the passage of time as well as RSUs that vest based on the Company's achievement of certain performance objectives over a three-year performance period.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
 Setting Executive  Compensation – Role of the  Executive Compensation  Committee and Management  
The Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation program for all executive officers, including the NEOs, for the senior officers of the Company's major business units, as well as determining and approving ongoing compensation arrangements for our NEOs. The Executive Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to the Board with respect to compensation for our Independent Directors. 
In making its decisions, the Executive Compensation Committee relies on advice from its independent compensation consultant and receives, reviews, and acts on recommendations from the CEO regarding salary, bonus and equity compensation for all executive officers including the NEOs (other than himself) and for the senior officers of its major business units. 
Our human resources department assists the CEO in the formulation of compensation recommendations to the Executive Compensation Committee, and other executive officers may provide relevant input as needed for persons other than themselves. It evaluates and approves these compensation elements annually. If relatives of any director or elected corporate principal officer are also employees of the Company or any subsidiary, the Executive Compensation Committee reviews compensation recommendations for such individuals. 
 Role of Independent  Compensation Consultant and  Comparable Company  Information  
The Executive Compensation Committee is authorized to retain the services of one or more executive compensation advisors, as it sees fit, in connection with the oversight of our executive compensation program. 
During fiscal year 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee independently engaged and received advice from Radford. Radford provided the Executive Compensation Committee with advice regarding senior executive compensation and non-employee director compensation. Radford was asked to survey executive compensation for similarly-sized companies in similar businesses in respect of senior executive positions and responsibilities. Radford also provided advice to the Executive Compensation Committee related to setting compensation for fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, the aggregate fees for determining or recommending the amount or form of executive and director compensation paid to Radford was $57,270. 
After review and consultation with Radford, the Executive Compensation Committee determined that Radford is independent and there was no conflict of interest resulting from retaining Radford during fiscal year 2018. In reaching these conclusions, the Executive Compensation Committee considered the factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and NYSE listing standards. 
Our Executive Compensation Committee has not historically established compensation levels based solely on benchmarking. Our Executive Compensation Committee has additionally relied upon the judgment of its members in making compensation decisions after reviewing our performance and carefully evaluating an NEO's performance during the year against established goals, leadership qualities, operational performance, business responsibilities, career with our company, current compensation arrangements and long-term potential to enhance shareholder value. 
In order to attract, retain and motivate senior executives, our annual compensation evaluation process does include a review of the salary, bonus and long-term incentive practices of organizations of similar size, in comparable industries, and concerning individuals with relevant responsibilities and experience. The CEO and our human resources department support their recommendations regarding executive compensation with this competitive market data. 
For fiscal year 2018, executive compensation levels by job category were reviewed in the context of industry survey data provided by three independent consulting firms (Radford, Mercer and Willis Towers Watson), which surveys were subscribed to by our human resources department (data is not customized for the Company). The companies included in these surveys have both a regional and national focus. Together, these surveys included data from approximately 4,000 companies and included data regarding both executive and non-executive salaries, bonuses and equity compensation. 
We do not instruct the providers of this data to significantly vary their reports from a standard format, the identities of the individual companies included in the surveys were not provided to the Executive Compensation Committee, and the Executive Compensation Committee did not refer to individual compensation information for such companies. Our objective is to obtain data from a broad spectrum of technology and defense companies and also from public companies with similar revenue levels. 
As part of its compensation review, Radford also prepared an independent assessment of competitive compensation levels and incentive practices for the Company's CEO for fiscal year 2018. The review was based on the survey data provided by our human resources department, as described above, as well as proxy disclosures by a select group of relevant peer companies. 
The peer companies were approved by the Executive Compensation Committee in November 2016 with review and input from the Executive Compensation Committee's previous independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, and senior management based on industry sector, similarity of business activities, size and performance. The objective was to have a group of companies sufficient in size and relevance to provide meaningful assessments of compensation levels 
CUBIC CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement        17

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
and practices. The peers included the following 15 defense and technology companies. 
AAR Corp  AeroVironment, Inc.  CACI International, Inc.  Enquility Holdings, Inc.  Esterline Technologies Corp.  HEICO Corp.  Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.  ManTech International Corporation  Mercury Systems, Inc.  NIC Inc.  Teledyne Technologies Inc.  Teradata Corporation  Tyler Technologies, Inc.  Venfone Systems, Inc.  ViaSat, Inc. 
The peer group remained unchanged for purposes of setting fiscal year 2018 executive compensation. While the Executive Compensation Committee reviewed the foregoing comparable company data in connection with its determinations of the fiscal year 2018 base salaries, target bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards for our NEOs, the Executive Compensation Committee did not attempt to set those compensation levels or awards at a certain target percentile with respect to the comparable company data or otherwise rely entirely on that data to determine NEO compensation. 
Instead, as described above and consistent with past practice, the Executive Compensation Committee members relied on their judgment and experience in setting those compensation levels and making those awards. We expect that the Executive Compensation Committee will continue to review comparable company data in connection with setting the compensation we offer our NEOs to help ensure that our compensation programs are competitive and fair. 
 Compensation Recovery Policy  
Management and the Board believe our compensation policies are not reasonably likely to result in the incurrence of a material adverse financial or other effect. Moreover, we believe our compensation policies and practices have not and will not impact our risk management objectives and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. However, the Board believes that it is prudent to maintain a compensation recovery policy. 
Pursuant to the terms of the compensation recovery or "clawback" policy, the Board is given the right to require the reimbursement or forfeiture of incentive compensation from an executive officer in the event the officer's wrongdoing is later determined by the Board to have resulted in (a) a restatement of the Company's financial results due to its material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws, or (b) a material negative revision of a financial or operating measure on the basis of which incentive compensation was awarded (a "Recoverable Event"). 
We believe that by providing the Company with the appropriate power to recover incentive compensation paid to an executive officer in this situation, the Company demonstrates its commitment to strong corporate governance. This clawback policy is in addition to any policies or recovery rights that are provided under applicable laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Under our clawback policy, if the Board determines that a Recoverable Event was caused by an executive officer's fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, it may require reimbursement from the executive officer for vested incentive compensation and/or the forfeiture of unvested or unpaid incentive compensation. The amount of incentive compensation that may be recovered or subject to forfeiture is any incentive compensation awarded, vested or paid to the executive officer that the executive officer would not have been awarded, vested or paid if the Company's financial results had been reported properly. The right to cause a forfeiture or recovery of incentive compensation applies to incentive compensation awarded, vested and/or paid during the twelve months prior to the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement and would be determined on an after-tax basis for any incentive compensation to be recovered from the executive officer. 
 Ownership Guidelines  
The Executive Compensation Committee has established management and directors stockholding guidelines (the "Ownership Guidelines") to further align the interests of management and the directors with the Company's shareholders, with the intent that the guidelines be met within five years of the 2014 implementation date, or the individual director or officer promotion or new hire date, whichever is later. 
The Ownership Guidelines are as follows: 
STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS (multiples of base salary or base retainer) 
Under the Ownership Guidelines, all Company shares directly held by the director or officer, his or her related trusts and immediate family shall be included in the calculations, provided, however, that any unvested RSUs shall not be included. 
 Anti-Hedging Policy  
Company policy prohibits our directors, NEOs and other elected officers from engaging in hedging transactions with respect to Company stock. 
 Response to the 2018  Say-On-Pay Vote  on Named Executive Officer  Compensation  
In February 2018, we held a say-on-pay vote, and our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our NEOs, with approximately 94% of shareholder votes cast in favor of our 2018

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
say-on-pay resolution (excluding abstentions and broker non-votes). As we evaluated our compensation practices and talent needs after this date, we were mindful of the strong support our shareholders expressed for our compensation philosophy. Following its annual review of our executive compensation practices after the annual meeting, the Executive Compensation Committee decided generally to retain the approach to executive compensation it had previously adopted for fiscal year 2017. 
In February 2017, we also held a vote on the frequency of holding future advisory votes on the Compensation of our NEOs. Our shareholders continue to support holding such advisory votes on an annual basis. 
 Fiscal Year 2018 Executive  Compensation Decisions  
The amount of each element of pay is determined annually taking into account factors including competitive company compensation data, as described above. A description of the executive compensation decisions with respect to fiscal year 2018 compensation for the NEOs is set forth below. 
 Base Salary  
Base salaries for our executives are established based on individual factors such as the scope of their responsibilities, background, track record, training and experience, as well as competitive company compensation information and the overall market demand for such executives at the time the respective executive is hired or promoted. 
As with total executive compensation, we believe that executive base salaries should be competitive with the range of salaries for executives in similar positions and with similar responsibilities at comparable companies, although we have not historically benchmarked executive base salaries against a specific market comparison group. An executive's base salary is also evaluated together with components of the executive's other compensation to ensure that the executive's total compensation is consistent with our overall compensation philosophy. 
In November 2017, the Executive Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries of the NEOs and after consultation with the CEO (with respect to the salaries of the other NEOs) and a review of the comparable company information described above. In addition, the Executive Compensation Committee asked Radford to review executive salaries against the peer group of companies described above and determined that Mr. Feldmann's salary was below market. 
The Executive Compensation Committee then, based upon Mr. Feldmann's performance and the appropriate targeted salary range for Mr. Feldmann in comparison with CEOs in peer companies, approved an adjustment that brought his compensation closer to the median of our peer companies. The Committee also reviewed the analysis of the other NEOs as compared to the median of peer companies and considered their performance in meeting their goals. After its review of this information, the Executive Compensation 
Committee determined to increase the base salaries for fiscal year 2018 of Mr. Feldmann by 10%, Mr. Aga by 10%, Admiral Buss by 7%, Mr. Cole by 10% and Mr. Twyman by 7% over each such officer's base salary for fiscal year 2017. 
The fiscal year 2018 base salaries for each of the NEOs are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
 Annual Incentives  
Our executive compensation program includes eligibility for an annual performance-based cash bonus for all executives. Our annual bonuses emphasize pay-for-performance by providing our executives with the opportunity to receive performance bonuses based on corporate performance relative to those measures which are determined by the Executive Compensation Committee to be most likely to enhance shareholder value. 
For fiscal year 2018, Mr. Feldmann had a target bonus of 100% of salary, Mr. Aga had a target bonus of 80% of salary, and each of Admiral Buss, Mr. Cole and Mr. Twyman had a target bonus of 70% of salary. The maximum bonus is 195% of the target bonus for each of the NEOs. 
For fiscal year 2018, the NEOs were eligible to receive a fiscal year 2018 bonus if the financial performance of the Company or a business segment of the Company met selected goals. The various performance objectives under the annual bonus plan are weighted depending on the Executive Compensation Committee's belief regarding the suitability of emphasis of each factor for that year's performance. 
The fiscal year 2018 annual bonuses for Messrs. Feldmann and Aga were tied to selected financial goals related to the Company's performance, including sales, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales ("Adjusted EBITDA Margin"), and sales divided by invested capital ("Invested Capital Turnover"). Of these financial goals, the fiscal year 2018 bonus formula identified the major elements as Adjusted EBITDA and Invested Capital Turnover for Messrs. Feldmann and Aga because the Executive Compensation Committee believes these financial metrics to be principal drivers of the attractiveness of an equity investment in the Company. The annual bonuses for Messrs. Feldmann and Aga were also tied, in part, to performance against company-wide cost savings goals in fiscal 2018. The Executive Compensation Committee set a target of $10.1 million of cost reductions in fiscal 2018 as compared to similar expenditures incurred by the Company in fiscal 2017 in categories which included consulting costs, personnel costs, and other cost categories primarily focused on selling, general, and administrative costs. 
The fiscal year 2018 annual bonus for Mr. Cole was tied to the performance of our CTS business including sales, Adjusted EBITDA and sales divided by average accounts receivable and inventory ("Asset Turnover") and Adjusted EBITDA of the Company. The fiscal year 2018 annual bonus for Admiral Buss was tied to the performance of our CGD business including sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Asset Turnover, and Adjusted EBITDA of the Company. The fiscal year 2018 annual bonus for Mr. Twyman was tied to the performance of our CMS business including sales, Adjusted EBITDA and Asset Turnover, and Adjusted EBITDA of the Company. The annual bonuses for these executives were also tied, in part, to performance against the same company-wide cost savings goals described above for Messrs. Feldmann and Aga.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION  
For Mr. Cole, Admiral Buss, and Mr. Twyman the fiscal year 2018 bonus formula identified the major bonus element as Adjusted EBITDA of our CTS, CGD and CMS businesses respectively. The Executive Compensation Committee selected these incentives because they wanted to reward the financial performance of the component of the Company to which such executives' services primarily relate. 
Target levels for the various performance objectives are set to require challenging but attainable goals depending on current market conditions and the Company's business prospects. The Executive Compensation Committee and management believe our annual bonus plan design balances the appropriate level of risk in management decision making with the careful use of capital and assets. The table below sets forth the performance objectives and weighting for purposes of each of the NEOs, our actual performance relative to those objectives during fiscal 2018 and the ultimate weighted percentage achievement for bonuses.

For the sales performance measure, the annual bonus formula for fiscal year 2018 provided that, for each 1% achievement above the target performance goal, the bonus amount attributable to that goal would be increased by 10% to a maximum of an additional 50% of that portion of the bonus amount at an achievement of 5% above the goal. For each of these performance goals, for each 1% shortfall in the goal, the bonus amount attributable to that goal would be decreased by 3%, 4.5% or 5% (depending on the amount of shortfall) so that 75% achievement of each of these goals would result in no bonus award for that goal. For the cost savings performance measure, the annual bonus formula for fiscal year 2018 provided that, for each 1% achievement above the target performance goal, the bonus amount attributable to that goal would be increased by 1.67% to a maximum of an additional 50% of that portion of the bonus amount at an achievement of 30% above the performance goal. For the cost savings performance goal, for each 1% shortfall in the goal, the bonus amount attributable to that goal would be decreased by 1.67% so that 70% achievement of the goal would result in no bonus award for that goal. 
The overall weighted percentage achievement relative to all performance goals for fiscal year 2018 for each NEO was then multiplied by an individual performance factor and then by each NEO's target bonus to determine his fiscal year 2018 annual bonus. The overall weighted percentage achievement relative to all performance goals for fiscal year 2017 was 99.1% for Messrs. Feldmann and Aga, 108.6% for Mr. Cole, 104.6% for Admiral Buss and 98.3% for Mr. Twyman. 
The individual performance multipliers were based on a formula based on the annual performance rating given to each individual. The ratings provided for a possible range of 0% to 130% for the multiplier factor. Mr. Feldmann rated Admiral Buss, and Messrs. Aga, Cole and Twyman and recommended the multiplier for each. The Executive Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the multipliers for each executive. The Executive Compensation Committee rated Mr. Feldmann, and then assigned a multiplier. Individual performance multipliers were based on internal performance evaluations and the subjective discretion of the Executive Compensation Committee. The multipliers determined by the Executive Compensation Committee were as follows: Mr. Feldmann – 1.10; Mr. Aga – 1.10; Mr. Cole – 1.10; Admiral Buss – 1.00; and Mr. Twyman – 1.00. 
Each NEO's fiscal year 2018 annual bonus award is disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
 Long-Term Equity Incentive Award Program  
The Company's long-term equity incentive awards are intended as an incentive for selected individuals to lead the Company in achieving long-term goals and to align their interests with the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders. The Company awards both performance-based and time-based restricted stock units pursuant to its long-term equity incentive award program. Each RSU represents a contingent right to receive one share of the Company's common stock. Vested shares will be delivered to the recipient following each vesting date. Dividend equivalent rights accrue with respect to the RSUs when and as dividends are paid on the Company's common stock and vest proportionately with the RSUs to which they relate. All of the RSU awards are made under the Company's 2015 Incentive Award Plan.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
The Executive Compensation Committee awards both time-based and performance-based RSUs to the executive officers. The use of performance-based RSUs as a component of the overall equity awards granted is based upon the Executive Compensation Committee's consideration of competitive market data, the desirability of utilizing a balanced system to mitigate risk, the desire to encourage superior performance while building ownership, and the desirability of this type of equity award as a component of a pay-for-performance program. 
 Fiscal 2018 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards.    In November 2017, the Executive Compensation Committee awarded the time-based vesting and performance-based vesting RSUs to the NEOs listed below.

For all time-based vesting RSUs, the RSUs vest in four equal installments on each of October 1, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company through each such date. 
The performance-based vesting RSUs granted to our NEOs are intended to reward the achievement of sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and return on equity ("ROE") objectives over a three-year performance period. The three-year performance period for the performance-based vesting RSUs granted on November 12, 2017 commenced on October 1, 2017 and will end on September 30, 2020. These performance-based RSUs are referred to as the "2018-2020 PRSUs." 
Specifically, recipients of the 2018-2020 PRSUs will be eligible to vest in such RSUs at the end of the three-year performance period based on the achievement of specified sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and ROE targets for the performance period established by the Executive Compensation Committee, subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company through such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in the applicable RSU agreement. 
The 2018-2020 PRSUs vest based 40% on sales growth achievement, 40% on Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and 20% on ROE achievement by the Company during the performance period. If the Company's sales growth achievement, Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and/or ROE achievement for the performance period equals or exceeds one of three different achievement levels (threshold, target and maximum), then a certain percentage of the RSUs will vest (25%, 100% and 200%, respectively). The percentage for determining the number of RSUs that will vest if performance is between the specified achievement levels will be determined by linear interpolation between the applicable achievement amounts for each measure. Performance below the threshold level for a performance measure will result in no vesting with respect to that measure. 
The Company's sales growth generally means the aggregate of the Company's sales during the performance period, divided by a baseline sales level determined by the Executive Compensation Committee. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA growth generally means the aggregate of the Company's Adjusted EBITDA during the performance period, divided by a baseline Adjusted EBITDA level determined by the Executive Compensation Committee. The Company's ROE for the performance period generally means the Company's net income ROE, expressed as an average annual percentage of beginning equity. 
Following the completion of the three-year performance period, the Executive Compensation Committee will certify the Company's performance relative to the sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and ROE objectives for such performance period. 
As described above, based on the level of such sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and ROE, the number of target RSUs granted to a recipient will be multiplied by a percentage from 0% to 200% to determine the number of RSUs vesting. 
   Performance-Based RSUs for Performance Period Ended September 30, 2018.  
The performance-based vesting RSUs granted on November 6, 2015 (referred to as the "2016-2018 PRSUs") were intended to reward the achievement of sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and ROE objectives over a three-year performance period. The three-year performance period for the 2016-2018 PRSUs commenced on October 1, 2015 and ended on September 30, 2018. These RSUs were eligible to vest based 40% on sales growth achievement, 40% on Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and 20% on return on equity achievement by the Company during such performance period. If the Company's sales growth achievement, Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and/or return on equity achievement for the performance period equals or exceeds one of three different achievement levels (threshold, target and maximum), then a certain percentage of the RSUs were eligible to vest (25%, 100% and 200%, respectively). The percentage for determining the number of RSUs that will vest if performance was between the specified achievement levels was determined by linear interpolation between the applicable achievement amounts for each measure. Performance below the threshold level for a performance measure will result in no vesting with respect to that measure. 
Following the completion of the three-year performance period that ended on September 30, 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee certified the Company's performance relative to the sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and ROE objectives for such performance period. As described in the table below, based on the level of such sales growth, Adjusted EBITDA growth, and return on equity, the Executive Compensation Committee determined that none of the 2016-2018 PRSUs would vest and all of the awards were cancelled.

   Accelerated Vesting of Time-Based RSUs. 
Time-based RSUs are generally forfeited unless an executive is continuously employed through the applicable vesting dates. There are, however, certain exceptions to this treatment. The time-based vesting RSUs granted by the Company vest immediately upon a recipient's termination of employment or service as a result of his death or disability. For time-based vesting RSUs the RSUs vest immediately upon a recipient's termination without cause or resignation for good reason within twelve months following a change in control. 
   Accelerated Vesting of Performance-Based RSUs.  
Performance-based RSUs are generally forfeited unless an executive is continuously employed through the last day of the performance period. The underlying principle is that the executive needs to have been an active employee during the entire performance period in order to have contributed to the results on which the earned awards are based. There are, however, certain exceptions to this treatment. 
Upon a change in control of the Company, a number of performance-based vesting RSUs equal to the target RSUs will vest immediately prior to the date of such change in control. 
In the event of a recipient's termination of employment or service as a result of his or her disability, termination without cause or resignation for good reason, the recipient will remain eligible to vest in the RSUs based on actual performance for the three-year performance period, with the resulting RSUs prorated for the portion of the performance period that elapsed prior to the date of such termination; and 
In the event of a recipient's death, the recipient will vest in the target RSUs, which target RSUs shall be prorated for the portion of the performance period that elapsed prior to the date of death.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
 Deferred Compensation Plan  
Certain of the directors and NEOs participate in the Cubic Corporation Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). For more information, please see the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table below. 
 Retirement Benefits  
All of our regular employees, including our NEOs, who meet certain defined requirements, may participate in our 401(k) plan. 401(k) matching payments and profit sharing plan contribution are equally available to all eligible employees. The profit sharing contribution percentage is based on a scale ranging from 2.5% to 9% of eligible compensation and is tied to the Company's ROE for the fiscal year. 
For 2018, the minimum threshold for ROE was not achieved, resulting in a profit sharing payout at the floor percentage of 2.5%. The value of the Company's contributions on behalf of the NEOs during fiscal year 2018 is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Certain of the NEOs are also participants in the Cubic Corporation Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), which plan was frozen as of December 31, 2006. Mr. Cole is a participant in the Cubic (UK) Limited Pension Scheme, which was closed to future service accruals as of September 30, 2010. For more information, please see the Pension Benefits table below. 
 Other Benefits  
We provide certain perquisites and personal benefits to our senior executives. These include annual physical examinations, term life insurance, a financial planning benefit of up to $15,000 per year per NEO in the first year and $10,000 per year per NEO thereafter, and an auto allowance. 
During fiscal 2018, we also provided each NEO a limited amount of administrative support for personal travel arrangements and other personal business at the Company's expense. In connection with his commencement of employment with us, we also agreed to provide Mr. Aga with relocation and home purchase assistance for one year from his commencement of employment, subject to the requirement that he repay any such assistance in the event he voluntarily terminates his employment prior to the second anniversary of his commencement of employment. 
Our Executive Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits to the NEOs to ensure they fit within the Company's overall compensation philosophy. 
 Severance and Change in Control Benefits  
The Board has approved severance and change in control arrangements in which our NEOs participate to provide for certain severance benefits in the event that a NEO's employment is involuntarily or constructively terminated, including in connection with a change in control. The Company recognizes the challenges executives often face securing new employment following termination. 
To mitigate these challenges and to secure the focus of our management team on the Company's affairs, all NEOs are entitled to receive severance payments under the Company's severance policy upon a termination by the Company without cause. The Company believes that reasonable severance benefits for its executive officers are important because it may be difficult for its executive officers to find comparable employment within a short period of time following certain qualifying terminations. 
In addition to normal severance, we provide enhanced benefits in the event of an involuntary termination or a constructive termination within 3 months before or 24 months after a change in control as a means of reinforcing and encouraging the continued attention and dedication of our executives to their duties of employment without personal distraction or conflict of interest in circumstances that could arise from the occurrence of a change in control. 
The Company believes that the interests of shareholders will be best served if the interests of its executive officers are aligned with them, and providing these change in control benefits should eliminate, or at least reduce, the reluctance of the Company's executives to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in the best interests of shareholders. 
Our Transition Protection Plan (the "Protection Plan"), under which the foregoing change in control severance benefits are provided, also assists in the retention and attraction of senior individuals by reducing their concern for financial security in the event of a job loss in connection with a change of control. While these arrangements form an integral part of the total compensation provided to these individuals and are considered by the Executive Compensation Committee when determining NEO compensation, the decision to offer these benefits did not influence the Executive Compensation Committee's determinations concerning other direct compensation or benefit levels. 
The terms of these severance arrangements are described below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
 Deductibility of Executive Compensation  
As part of its role, the Executive Compensation Committee reviews and considers the deductibility of the Company's executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) generally limits the tax deduction for compensation in excess of one million dollars paid to certain executive officers. Our Executive Compensation Committee does not necessarily limit executive compensation to the amount deductible under that provision. 
24    CUBIC CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION
In its review and establishment of compensation programs and awards for our NEOs, the Executive Compensation Committee considers the anticipated deductibility or non-deductibility of the compensation as only one factor in assessing whether a particular compensatory arrangement is appropriate, particularly in light of the goals of maintaining a competitive executive compensation system generally (i.e., paying for performance and maximizing shareholder return). 
We reserve the right to use our judgment to authorize compensation payments that do not qualify for the compensation deduction if, in light of all applicable circumstances, we believe that such payments are appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 Executive Compensation Committee Report  
The material in this report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Cubic Corporation has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on such review and discussions, recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and in the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

 CEO Pay Ratio  
   Pay Ratio Disclosure  
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Bradley H. Feldmann, our CEO. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For fiscal year 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
Based on this information, for fiscal year 2018, the ratio of the median of the total compensation of all employees of the Company to the annual total compensation of, Bradley H. Feldmann, our CEO was 70 to 1. 
   Determining the Median Employee  
We determined that, as of September 30, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 5,562 individuals, with 42% of these individuals located in the United States and 58% located outside of the United States. We applied the de minimis exception as permitted by SEC rules in determining our employee population. Under this exception, we excluded a total of 278 employees, comprising less than 5% of our total employee population, from the following countries: Singapore (183 employees), India (87 employees), Italy (8 employees). In addition, as permitted by SEC rules, we did not include independent contractors or similar non-employee workers in our employee population. 
For purposes of measuring the compensation of our employees, we selected total annual cash compensation for fiscal year 2018 as the most appropriate measure of compensation, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. Compensation was annualized for employees who did not work the entire 12-month period. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the "median employee". We did convert all total cash compensation figures to USD using the applicable exchange rate on November 27, 2018. 
   Compensation Measure and Annual Total Compensation of "Median Employee"  
With respect to the total annual compensation of the "median employee," we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $66,017. 
   Annual Total Compensation of CEO  
With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our fiscal year 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.

The RSUs vest based 40% on sales growth achievement, 40% on Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and 20% on ROE achievement by the Company during such performance period. If the Company's sales growth achievement, Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement and/or ROE achievement for the performance period equals or exceeds one of three different achievement levels (threshold, target and maximum), then a certain percentage of the RSUs will vest (25%, 100% and 200%, respectively). The percentage for determining the number of RSUs that will vest if performance is between the specified achievement levels will be determined by linear interpolation between the applicable achievement amounts for each measure.  
Upon a change in control of the Company, a number of performance-based vesting RSUs equal to the target RSUs will vest immediately prior to the date of such change in control. For more information about the accelerated vesting of these RSUs, see "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" above.

The performance period for 2017-2019 PRSUs granted on November 14, 2016 commenced on October 1, 2016 and will end on September 30, 2019. For the 2017-2019 PRSUs, the number of shares listed equals the number of shares that may be issued to the NEOs pursuant to these performance-based vesting RSUs at threshold performance, as the current estimate is that the 2017-2019 PRSU's will vest below threshold levels. The performance period for 2018-2020 PRSUs granted on November 27, 2017 commenced on October 1, 2017 and will end on September 30, 2020. For the 2018-2020 PRSUs, the number of shares listed equals the number of shares that may be issued to the NEOs pursuant to these performance-based vesting RSUs at maximum performance, as the current estimate is that the 2018-2020 PRSU's will vest between target and maximum levels.  
For all performance-based vesting RSUs above, the RSUs will vest based 40% on sales growth achievement, 40% on Adjusted EBITDA growth achievement, and 20% on ROE achievement by the Company during such performance period.

 Potential Payments Upon  Termination or Change in  Control  
   General Severance Policy  
The Company has a severance policy (the "Severance Policy") applicable to many of its full time U.S.-based employees, including the NEOs. In the event of a Company-originated termination without cause, the eligible individual who has completed three years of employment with the Company is offered the opportunity to receive, in exchange for signing a general release, a lump sum payment of one week of base pay at their current rate for each 12 months of employment, and payment of medical and dental coverage under COBRA for up to 12 months. Outplacement consultation may be provided at the Company's discretion. 
In individual circumstances, an NEO may be offered alternative arrangements to be negotiated. These severance benefits are not offset by the Company's normal retirement benefits. Other than the COBRA payments, the cash severance payments under the Severance Policy would be paid to a NEO in addition to any payments under the Protection Plan, as described below, in the event his termination of employment by the Company without cause were to occur under the circumstances described under the Protection Plan. 
   Transition Protection Plan  
The Company's Protection Plan is intended to be made available upon specific approval of an individual for participation in the Protection Plan by the Executive Compensation Committee. It is intended to benefit selected principal officers and other selected key personnel. The Executive Compensation Committee has approved participation in the Protection Plan by each of the NEOs. 
If there is any change of control of the Company (as defined below), and within 3 months before or 24 months after such change in control, a participant's employment involuntarily terminates without cause (as defined below), or the participant resigns for good reason (as defined below), then the Company would be obligated (1) to pay such person a monthly amount, for 24 months, computed as the immediately preceding five fiscal years' monthly average of salary and bonus, and (2) to continue for 18 months the participant's participation in the medical and dental plans of the Company in which such participant participated at the time of termination. Miscellaneous additional benefits, including outplacement service of up to $6,000, may also be provided. 
A "change in control" occurs when a "person" acquires sufficient shares of our voting stock to elect a majority of our directors, assuming 90% of outstanding shares vote; a merger resulting in a substantial change in the directors; and certain other events. 
An "involuntary termination without cause" occurs when there is any involuntary termination of employment without (1) a willful and continued failure of the employee to perform substantially his duties, or (2) his gross negligence or breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit (etc.) or (3) his conviction or plea of no contest or guilty to state or federal felony criminal laws. 
A resignation "for good reason" occurs when the authority, duties, function or responsibilities of the employee are substantially reduced, his base salary is reduced, his bonus participation opportunity is reduced by more than 50%, his job location is substantially changed, or the Company materially breaches the Protection Plan. 
Following termination, to receive monthly payments the executive must execute a general release and must not breach the Company's proprietary information policy and must not interfere with the employees, customers or suppliers of the Company. 
   Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards  
The long-term equity incentive awards granted to the NEOs may vest under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of the Company and/or certain terminations of employment. For more information about the accelerated vesting provisions applicable to these awards, see "Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" above. 
   Retirement Benefits  
Certain of the NEOs are participants in the Pension Plan or the UK Pension Scheme. For more information about payments payable to the NEOs under the pension plans upon a termination of employment, please see the Pension Benefits table above. Certain of the NEOs are participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. For more information about amounts payable to the NEOs under the Deferred Compensation Plan upon a termination of employment, please see the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Fiscal Year 2018 table above.

 Potential Payments Upon  Termination or Change in  Control Table  
The following table summarizes potential change in control and termination payments to each NEO. The five right-hand columns describe the payments that would apply in five different potential scenarios – a termination without cause apart from a change in control; a termination of employment as a result of the NEO's resignation for good reason or termination of employment by us other than for cause, in each case within 3 months prior to or 24 months following a change in control; a change in control without a termination of employment; the NEO's death; or the NEO's termination of employment as a result of his disability. The table assumes that the termination or change in control occurred on September 30, 2018. For purposes of estimating the value of accelerated equity awards to be received in the event of a termination of employment or change in control, we have assumed a price per share of our common stock of $73.05, which represents the closing market price of our common stock as reported on the NYSE on September 30, 2018.

    CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS
 Related Persons  
The Charter of our Executive Compensation Committee requires it to review and approve the compensation of any persons related to any director or executive officer. As a practical matter the Committee will also review any non-compensation transactions between the Company and its directors, senior officers and their relatives. 
Consistent with SEC regulations and NYSE listing standards, a related person transaction is any transaction in which the Company was, is, or will be a participant, where the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which a related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A related person includes any director or executive officer of the Company, any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, an immediate family member of any person described above; and any firm, corporation, or other entity controlled by any person described above. 
Each director and executive officer completes an annual questionnaire to identify related interests and persons. 
There have been no transactions since the beginning of fiscal year 2018 which were determined by the Committee to be with "related persons".

    PROPOSAL 3: APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF CUBIC CORPORATION
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" Each of These Proposals
After careful consideration and upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board voted to approve, and to recommend to our shareholders that they approve, amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (our "Certificate") to: 
The Board recognizes that views regarding good corporate governance practices evolve and that the elimination of supermajority voting requirements enjoys the support of many institutional shareholders and key proxy advisory firms. Many investors and commentators view supermajority provisions as limiting a Board's accountability to shareholders and the ability of shareholders to effectively participate in corporate governance. The Board is also aware of the view that a majority vote should be all that is necessary to effect certain changes in a board or to take other shareholder actions. Additionally, the Board is aware that some supermajority voting requirements, whether they apply to the Board or to shareholders, can be cumbersome and stand in the way of needed and desired changes. 
To implement these changes, the Board has unanimously adopted resolutions to amend or remove these provisions of our Certificate and to make certain technical and conforming changes. The Board is recommending that shareholders approve these amendments at the Annual Meeting. The proposed amendments to our Certificate are described below. A form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, marked to reflect the changes contemplated by Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d), including technical and conforming changes (and giving effect to the prior amendment to our Certificate), is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. This summary of the proposed amendments to our Certificate (and the following discussion relating to Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d)) is qualified in its entirety by reference to Appendix A. None of Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d) are conditioned on the approval of the other proposals, so a negative outcome on one proposal will not affect the outcome of the other proposals. If any of these proposed amendments to our Certificate are approved at the Annual Meeting, we will file an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State following the Annual Meeting to incorporate the approved amendments, at which point the approved amendments will become effective. Our Board reserves the right, at any time prior to the effectiveness of the filing of the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to abandon the proposed amendments 
 Vote Required  
With respect to each of Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d) below, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (662/3%) of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting is required to approve each Proposal. For each of Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d) you will have the option to vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on the Proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have the same effect as shares voted against each of Proposal 3(a), Proposal 3(b), Proposal 3(c) and Proposal 3(d).

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF CUBIC CORPORATION
PROPOSAL 3(A) – ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
 General  
We are asking you to approve an amendment to our Certificate, the effect of which would be to eliminate the supermajority voting requirement to approve certain business combinations identified in the Certificate. 
The Certificate currently provides that, unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds (662/3%) of the Company's common stock or the Board had previously approved a memorandum of understanding with the potential business combination partner, the Company may not enter into any of the following business combinations:
If the proposed amendment is approved and adopted by the shareholders, then Article 7 of the Certificate will be deleted and any business combination would be subject to the approval of the requisite number of shareholders required under the Delaware General Corporation Law. Additionally, if the proposed amendment is approved and adopted, the applicable technical and conforming changes shown in Appendix A hereto will also be made. 
 Purpose of the Amendment  
After evaluation, the Board has determined that while the current voting requirement imposed by the Certificate is designed to incentivize potential business combination partners to first contact the Board so that it can evaluate and negotiate such opportunities in advance, the Board recognizes that there are different perspectives on this matter and compelling arguments for the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to engage in certain business combination transactions. After carefully weighing all of these considerations, the Board approved the proposed amendment to the Certificate and recommended that the shareholders adopt these amendments by voting in favor of this proposal. 
If our shareholders do not approve this proposal, then the business combinations covered by the Certificate will continue to require the approval of no less than 662/3% of the total outstanding common stock of the Company. 
PROPOSAL 3(B) – ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BOARD TO AMEND OUR BYLAWS TO CHANGE THE AUTHORIZED NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
 General  
We are asking you to approve an amendment to our Certificate, the effect of which would be to eliminate the supermajority voting requirement for the Board to amend our Bylaws to increase or reduce the number of authorized directors on the Board. 
The Certificate currently provides that the Board may not amend our Bylaws to increase or reduce the authorized number of directors on the Board unless not less than two-thirds (2/3rds) of the then authorized number of directors approve such a resolution. If the proposed amendment is approved and adopted by the shareholders, the relevant voting requirement for the Board would no longer be required to obtain two-thirds (2/3rds) of the then authorized number of directors to make any amendment to our Bylaws; the Board could amend our Bylaws by a majority vote. 
 Purpose of the Amendment  
After evaluation, the Board has determined that the supermajority requirement imposed by the Certificate to increase or reduce the authorized number of directors is not necessary. Currently our Bylaws do not set a specific number of authorized directors on the Board and instead provide that the size of the Board shall be fixed from time to time by resolution passed by the Board. Additionally, the supermajority voting requirement is potentially burdensome on the Company because it would require a higher voting threshold to amend specific portions of our Bylaws even if there were unfilled vacancies on the Board. For example, if the Bylaws provided for the number of authorized directors to be set at nine, an affirmative vote of at least six directors would be required to amend that provision of the Bylaws, even if there were multiple unfilled vacancies and/or fewer than six directors then serving on the Board. 
If our shareholders do not approve this proposal, our Board will continue to need the approval of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the then authorized number of directors to increase or reduce the authorized number of directors that may serve of the Board.

PROPOSAL 3(C) – ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO AMEND OUR BYLAWS
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
 General  
We are asking you to approve an amendment to our Certificate, the effect of which would be to eliminate the supermajority voting requirement to make, repeal, alter or amend our Bylaws. 
The Certificate currently provides that shareholders may not make, repeal, alter or amend our Bylaws unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 662/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company. If the proposed amendment is approved and adopted by the shareholders, the relevant voting requirement to amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws in the future would be a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company. 
 Purpose of the Amendment  
After evaluation, the Board has determined that while the current voting requirement imposed by the Certificate is designed to ensure that interests of all shareholders are fully protected, the Board recognizes that there are different perspectives on this matter and compelling arguments for the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to amend a company's bylaws, including growing sentiment that the elimination of such a provision provides shareholders greater ability to participate in the corporate governance of a company. The Board has also determined that an increasing number of companies are beginning to view such a voting requirement as overly burdensome. After carefully weighing all of these considerations, the Board approved the proposed amendment to the Certificate and recommended that the shareholders adopt these amendments by voting in favor of this proposal. 
If our shareholders do not approve this proposal, amendment, alteration or repeal of provisions of our Bylaws will continue to require the approval of no less than 662/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company. 
PROPOSAL 3(D) – ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS FOR AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
 General  
We are asking you to approve an amendment to our Certificate, the effect of which would be to eliminate supermajority voting requirements for approval of amendments to certain provisions of our Certificate. 
The Certificate currently requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company to repeal or amend the following provisions of our Certificate:
If the proposed amendment is approved and adopted by the shareholders, the relevant voting requirement to approve amendments to such provisions of our Certificate in the future would be a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the 
Company. If Proposal 3(a) is approved and adopted by the shareholders then reference to the deleted provision governing the approval of certain business combinations will be deleted, regardless of whether this Proposal 3(d) is approved. 
 Purpose of the Amendment  
After evaluation, the Board has determined that, while the current supermajority voting requirements imposed by the Certificate are designed to ensure that interests of all shareholders are fully protected, the Board recognizes that there are different perspectives on this matter and compelling arguments for the elimination of supermajority voting requirements to amend a company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including growing sentiment that the elimination of such a provision provides shareholders greater ability to participate in the corporate governance of a company. The Board has also determined that an increasing number of companies are beginning to view such a voting requirement as overly burdensome. After carefully weighing all of these considerations, the Board approved the proposed amendment to the Certificate and recommended that the shareholders adopt these amendments by voting in favor of this proposal. 
If our shareholders do not approve this proposal, amendment or repeal of the provisions of our Certificate referenced above will continue to require the approval of at least 662/3% of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company.

    PROPOSAL 4:   APPROVE THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT   OF THE CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE   AWARD PLAN
The Board Unanimously Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
We are requesting that our shareholders approve an amendment and restatement of our 2015 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the "Restated Plan"). The existing 2015 Incentive Award Plan is referred to herein as the "Existing Plan. "In December 2018, our Board approved the Restated Plan, subject to shareholder approval. The Restated Plan will be effective as of the date on which our shareholders approve the Restated Plan. If the Restated Plan is not approved by our shareholders, the Restated Plan will not become effective, the Existing Plan will continue in full force and effect, and we may continue to grant awards under the Existing Plan, subject to its terms, conditions and limitations, using the shares available for issuance thereunder. 
 Description of Proposed Amendments  
The Restated Plan retains the same individual annual award limits that were in effect under the Existing Plan. Specifically, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any participant, other than a non-employee director, pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year cannot exceed 1,325,000 shares. However, this number may be adjusted to take into account equity restructurings and certain other corporate transactions as described below. In addition, the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards initially payable in cash shall be $10,000,000. In addition, the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any non-employee director pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year for services as a non-employee director cannot exceed 100,000 shares. The foregoing share number may be adjusted for changes in our capitalization and certain corporate transactions, as described below under the headings "Adjustments" and "Corporate Transactions."

PROPOSAL 4: APPROVE THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN  
The Restated Plan is not being amended in any material respect other than to reflect the changes described above. 
 Equity Incentive Awards Are Critical to Long-Term Shareholder Value Creation  
Our Existing Plan is the only equity plan pursuant to which we may grant equity awards to our directors, employees and consultants (other than our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (our "ESPP")), and we believe that the adoption of the Restated Plan is essential to our success. Equity awards are intended to motivate high levels of performance, align the interests of our directors, employees and consultants with those of our shareholders by giving directors, employees and consultants the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in our company and providing a means of recognizing their contributions to the success of our company. Our Board and management believe that equity awards are necessary to remain competitive in our industry and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified employees who help our company meet its goals. As of December 14, 2018, 582 of our 5,797 employees had received grants of equity awards and all 8 of our Independent Directors had received grants of equity awards. We have not historically granted equity awards to our consultants (of which we had approximately 1,040 as of December 14, 2018). 
The table below presents information about the number of shares that were subject to outstanding equity awards under our equity incentive plans and the shares remaining available for issuance under the Existing Plan and the ESPP, each at December 14, 2018, and the proposed increase in shares authorized for issuance under the Restated Plan.

In determining whether to approve the Restated Plan, including whether to increase the share reserve under the Restated Plan over the share reserve under the Existing Plan, our Board of Directors considered the input of Radford Aon Hewitt ("Radford"), the Executive Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and the following:

In light of the factors described above, and the fact that the ability to continue to grant equity compensation is vital to our ability to continue to attract and retain employees in the extremely competitive labor markets in which we compete, our Board of Directors has determined that the size of the share reserve under the Restated Plan is reasonable and appropriate at this time. Our Board of Directors will not create a subcommittee to evaluate the risk and benefits for issuing shares under the Restated Plan. 
 Other Key Features of the Restated Plan  
We depend on the performance and commitment of our employees to succeed. The use of equity-based long-term incentives assists us in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding talented employees. Providing equity grants creates long-term participation in our company and aligns the interests of our employees with the interests of our shareholders. The use of equity awards as compensation also allows us to conserve cash resources for other important purposes. 
The Restated Plan reflects a broad range of compensation and governance best practices, with some of the key features of the Restated Plan as follows:
our common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any participant, other than a non-employee director, pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year cannot exceed 1,325,000 shares. However, this number may be adjusted to take into account equity restructurings and certain other corporate transactions as described below. In addition, the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards initially payable in cash shall be $10,000,000. In addition, the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any non-employee director pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year for services as a non-employee director cannot exceed 100,000 shares. 
 Shareholder Approval Requirement  
In general, shareholder approval of the Restated Plan is necessary in order for us to (1) meet the shareholder approval requirements of the principal securities market on which shares of our common stock are traded, and (2) grant stock options that qualify as incentive stock options, or ISOs, as defined under Section 422 of the Code. 
 Summary of the Restated Plan  
This section summarizes certain principal features of the Restated Plan. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Restated Plan. Shareholders are urged to read the actual text of the Restated Plan in its entirety, which is set forth in Appendix B to this proxy statement.

PROPOSAL 4: APPROVE THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
 Authorized Shares.    The Restated Plan authorizes the issuance of 2,783,268 shares of our common stock, representing an increase of 1,200,000 shares over the existing share reserve under the Existing Plan. In no event will more than 2,783,268 shares of our common stock be issuable pursuant to ISOs under the Restated Plan. 
If any award under the Restated Plan is forfeited, expires or is settled in cash, then the shares subject to such award may be used again for future grants of awards under the Restated Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares tendered or withheld to satisfy the exercise price of an option granted under the Restated Plan or any tax withholding obligation with respect to an award granted under the Restated Plan, any shares subject to a SAR that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of such award on exercise, and shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options granted under the Restated Plan, will not be added to the shares authorized for grant under the Restated Plan. Shares forfeited by a participant or repurchased by us at a price not greater than the price originally paid by the participant will also again be available for awards under the Restated Plan. The payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Restated Plan. 
To the extent permitted by applicable law or any exchange rule, and subject to certain other restrictions, shares issued in assumption of, or in substitution for, any outstanding awards or shares available under a pre-existing plan of an entity acquired by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that was approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition will not be counted against the shares available for grant under the Restated Plan. 
 Plan Administration.    The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board will administer the Restated Plan (except with respect to any award granted to non-employee directors, which must be administered by our full Board). To the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, the members of the Executive Compensation Committee must each be a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and, with respect to awards that are intended to be performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, an "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m). In addition, to the extent required by applicable law, each member of the Executive Compensation Committee (or another committee or subcommittee of the Board assuming the functions of the Executive Compensation Committee under the Restated Plan shall be an "independent director" under the rules of any securities exchange on which the shares of our common stock are listed. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Restated Plan, our Executive Compensation Committee has the authority to select the persons to whom awards are to be made, to determine the type or types of awards to be granted to each person, the number of awards to grant, the number of shares to be subject to such awards, and the terms and conditions of such awards, and to make all other determinations and decisions and to take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the Restated Plan. Our Executive Compensation Committee is also authorized to establish, adopt, amend or revise rules relating to administration of the Restated Plan. Our Board may at any time revest in itself the authority to administer the Restated Plan. 
 Eligibility.    Options, SARs, restricted stock and other awards under the Restated Plan may be granted to individuals who are then our officers or employees or are the officers or employees of any of our subsidiaries. Such awards may also be granted to our non-employee directors and consultants but only employees may be granted ISOs. As of December 14, 2018, there were eight non-employee directors and 5,797 employees who would have been eligible for awards under the Restated Plan had it been in effect on such date. Although the Restated Plan permits the plan administrator to make grants to the approximately 
1,040 consultants of the Company (as of December 14, 2018), the Company as a general practice has not in the past granted awards from the Existing Plan to consultants. 
The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any participant, other than a non-employee director, under the Restated Plan during any calendar year cannot exceed 1,325,000 shares. In addition, the maximum aggregate amount of cash that may be paid in cash to any one person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards initially payable in cash shall be $10,000,000. In addition, the maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be subject to one or more awards granted to any non-employee director pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year for services as a non-employee director cannot exceed 100,000 shares. 
 Awards.    The Restated Plan provides that our Executive Compensation Committee (or the Board, in the case of awards to non-employee directors) may grant or issue stock options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, stock payments and performance awards, or any combination thereof. Our Executive Compensation Committee (or the Board, in the case of awards to non-employee directors) will consider each award grant subjectively, considering factors such as the individual performance of the recipient and the anticipated contribution of the recipient to the attainment of our long-term goals. Each award will be set forth in a separate agreement with the person receiving the award and will indicate the type, terms and conditions of the award.

PROPOSAL 4: APPROVE THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
 Tax Withholding.    The Restated Plan permits the Executive Compensation Committee to allow for the withholding or surrender of shares in satisfaction of tax withholding with respect to awards with a value up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction at the time of such withholding (or such other rate as may be required to avoid the liability classification of the applicable award under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America). 
 Transferability of Awards.    Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our Restated Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an option or SAR may exercise such an award during his or her lifetime. 
 Performance Criteria.    Under the Restated Plan, the Executive Compensation Committee may grant awards that are paid, vest or become exercisable upon the attainment of performance criteria, which may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following business criteria, each of which may be measured with respect to our performance or the performance of a division, business unit or an individual: (1) net earnings (either before or after one or more of (a) interest, (b) taxes, (c) depreciation, (d) amortization, (e) goodwill impairment charges, and (f) non-cash equity-based compensation expense), (2) gross or net sales or revenue, (3) net income (either before or after taxes), (4) adjusted net income, (5) operating earnings or profit, (6) cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow and free cash flow), (7) return on assets, (8) return on capital, (9) return on shareholders' equity, (10) total shareholder return, (11) return on sales, (12) gross or net profit or operating margin, (13) costs, (14) expenses, (15) working capital, (16) earnings per share, (17) adjusted earnings per share, (18) price per share, (19) implementation or completion of critical projects, (20) market share, (21) economic value, (22) comparisons with various stock market indices, (23) capital raised in financing transactions or other financing milestones, (24) shareholders' equity, (25) market recognition (including, but not limited to, awards and analyst ratings), (26) financial ratios, (27) return on invested capital, (28) asset turnover, and (29) implementation, completion or attainment of objectively determinable objectives relating to commercial or strategic milestones or developments. These performance criteria may be measured in absolute terms or as compared to any incremental increase or decrease or as compared to results of a peer group or to market performance indicators or indices. The Executive Compensation Committee shall select the performance criteria for each performance award for purposes of establishing the performance goal or performance goals applicable to such performance award for the designated performance period. With regard to a particular performance period, the Executive Compensation Committee will have the discretion to select the length of the performance period. 
The Executive Compensation Committee may provide that one or more adjustments will be made to one or more of the performance goals established for any performance period. Such adjustments may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: (1) items related to a change in accounting principle, (2) items relating to financing activities, (3) expenses for restructuring or productivity initiatives, (4) other non-operating items, (5) items related to acquisitions, (6) items attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by us during the performance period, (7) items related to the disposal of a business or segment of a business, (8) items related to discontinued operations that do not qualify as a segment of a business under applicable accounting standards, (9) items attributable to any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares occurring during the performance period, (10) any other items of significant income or expense which are determined to be appropriate adjustments, (11) items relating to unusual or extraordinary corporate transactions, events or developments, (12) items related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, (13) items that are outside the scope of our core, on-going business activities, (14) items relating to changes in tax laws, (15) items relating to asset impairment charges, (16) items relating to gains and losses for litigation, arbitration or

contractual settlements, or (17) items relating to any other unusual or nonrecurring events or changes in applicable laws, accounting principles or business conditions. 
 Forfeiture, Recoupment and Clawback Provisions.    Pursuant to its general authority to determine the terms and conditions applicable to awards under the Restated Plan, the Executive Compensation Committee has the right to provide, in an award agreement or otherwise, that an award shall be subject to the provisions of any recoupment or clawback policies implemented by us, including, without limitation, any recoupment or clawback policies adopted to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 Adjustments.    If there is any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash dividends) of our assets to shareholders, or any other change affecting the shares of our common stock or the share price of our common stock other than an equity restructuring (as defined in the Restated Plan), the plan administrator may make such equitable adjustments, if any, as the plan administrator in its discretion may deem appropriate to reflect such change with respect to (1) the aggregate number and type of shares that may be issued under the Restated Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the number of shares available under the Restated Plan, the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to ISOs under the Restated Plan and the maximum number of shares which may be subject to one or more awards to a participant pursuant to the Restated Plan during any calendar year), (2) the number and kind of shares, or other securities or property, subject to outstanding awards, (3) the terms and conditions of any outstanding awards (including, without limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect thereto), and (4) the grant or exercise price per share for any outstanding awards under the Restated Plan. If there is any equity restructuring, the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding award and the grant or exercise price per share for each outstanding award, if applicable, will be proportionately adjusted. Adjustments in the event of an equity restructuring will not be discretionary. Any adjustment affecting an award intended as "qualified performance-based compensation" will be made consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. The plan administrator also has the authority under the Restated Plan to take certain other actions with respect to outstanding awards in the event of a corporate transaction, including provision for the cash-out, termination, assumption or substitution of such awards. 
 Corporate Transactions.    In the event of a change in control where the acquirer does not assume awards granted under the Restated Plan, awards issued under the Restated Plan shall, to the extent held by a participant who has not experienced a termination of service prior to the date of such change in control, be subject to accelerated vesting such that 100% of the awards will become vested and exercisable or payable, as applicable. Under the Restated Plan, a change in control is generally defined as:
 Amendment and Termination; Repricing Without Shareholder Approval Prohibited.    Our Board and our Executive Compensation Committee have the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the Restated Plan at any time. However, shareholder approval of any amendment to the Restated Plan will be obtained to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule. Additionally, shareholder approval is required to (1) increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Restated Plan, (2) increase the limits imposed on the maximum number of shares that may be issued to any individual under the Restated Plan during any calendar year or the limit on the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to ISOs under the Restated Plan, (3) reduce the per-share exercise price of the shares subject to any option or SAR, and (4) cancel any option or SAR in exchange for cash or another award when the option or SAR price per share exceeds the fair market value of the underlying shares. Except as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Restated Plan will impair the rights or obligations of a holder under an award theretofore granted, unless such award expressly so provides or such holder consents. If not earlier terminated by our Board or the Executive Compensation Committee, the Restated Plan will continue until the tenth anniversary of the date of the Board's initial adoption of the Restated Plan. As a result, no awards may be granted under the Restated Plan after December 18, 2028. 
 Securities Laws.    The Restated Plan is intended to conform to all provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act and any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder, including, without limitation, Rule 16b-3. The Restated Plan will be administered, and awards will be granted and may be exercised, only in such a manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.

   Federal Income Tax Consequences  
The material federal income tax consequences of the Restated Plan under current federal income tax law are summarized in the following discussion, which deals with the general tax principles applicable to the Restated Plan. The following discussion is based upon laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. Foreign, state and local tax laws, and employment, estate and gift tax considerations are not discussed due to the fact that they may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. 
 Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.    A Restated Plan participant generally will not recognize taxable income and we generally will not be entitled to a tax deduction upon the grant of a stock option or SAR. The tax consequences of exercising a stock option and the subsequent disposition of the shares received upon exercise will depend upon whether the option qualifies as an ISO as defined in Section 422 of the Code. The Restated Plan permits the grant of options that are intended to qualify as ISOs as well as options that are not intended to so qualify; however, ISOs may be granted only to our employees and employees of our parent or subsidiary corporations, if any. Upon exercising an option that does not qualify as an ISO when the fair market value of our stock is higher than the exercise price of the option, a Restated Plan participant generally will recognize taxable income at ordinary income tax rates equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise over the purchase price, and we (or our subsidiaries, if any) generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense, in the amount equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares purchased exceeds the purchase price for the shares. Upon a subsequent sale or other disposition of the option shares, the participant will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the sales price of the shares and the participant's tax basis in the shares. 
Upon exercising an ISO, a Restated Plan participant generally will not recognize taxable income, and we will not be entitled to a tax deduction for compensation expense. However, upon exercise, the amount by which the fair market value of the shares purchased exceeds the purchase price will be an item of adjustment for alternative minimum tax purposes. The participant will recognize taxable income upon a sale or other taxable disposition of the option shares. For federal income tax purposes, dispositions are divided into two categories: qualifying and disqualifying. A qualifying disposition generally occurs if the sale or other disposition is made more than two years after the date the option was granted and more than one year after the date the shares are transferred upon exercise. If the sale or disposition occurs before these two periods are satisfied, then a disqualifying disposition generally will result. 
Upon a qualifying disposition of ISO shares, the participant will recognize long-term capital gain in an amount equal to the excess of the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of the shares over their purchase price. If there is a disqualifying disposition of the shares, then the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or, if less, the price at which the shares are sold) over their purchase price will be taxable as ordinary income to the participant. If there is a disqualifying disposition in the same year of exercise, it eliminates the item of adjustment for alternative minimum tax purposes. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon the disposition will be recognized as a capital gain or loss by the participant. 
We will not be entitled to any tax deduction if the participant makes a qualifying disposition of ISO shares. If the participant makes a disqualifying disposition of the shares, we should be entitled to a tax deduction for compensation expense in the amount of the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
Upon exercising or settling a SAR, a Restated Plan participant will recognize taxable income at ordinary income tax rates, and we should be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense, in the amount paid or value of the shares issued upon exercise or settlement. Payments in shares will be valued at the fair market value of the shares at the time of the payment, and upon the subsequent disposition of the shares the participant will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the sales price of the shares and the participant's tax basis in the shares. 
 Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.    A Restated Plan participant generally will not recognize taxable income and we generally will not be entitled to a tax deduction upon the grant of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Upon the termination of restrictions on restricted stock or the settlement of restricted stock units, the participant will recognize taxable income at ordinary income tax rates, and we should be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense, in the amount paid to the participant or the amount by which the then fair market value of the shares received by the participant exceeds the amount, if any, paid for them. Upon the subsequent disposition of any shares, the participant will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the sales price of the shares and the participant's tax basis in the shares. However, a Restated Plan participant granted restricted stock that is subject to forfeiture or repurchase through a vesting schedule such that it is subject to a "risk of forfeiture" (as defined in Section 83 of the Code) may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to recognize taxable income at ordinary income tax rates, at the time of the grant, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of grant, less the amount paid, if any, for such shares. We will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation, in the amount recognized as taxable income by the participant. If a timely Section 83(b) election is made, the participant will not recognize any additional ordinary income on the termination of restrictions on restricted stock, and we will not be entitled to any additional tax deduction. 
 Dividend Equivalents, Stock Payment Awards and Cash-Based Awards.    A Restated Plan participant will generally not recognize taxable income and we will not be entitled to a tax deduction upon the grant of dividend equivalents, stock payment awards or cash-based awards until cash or shares are paid or distributed to the participant. At that time, any cash payments or the fair market value of shares that the participant receives will be taxable to the participant at ordinary income tax rates and we should be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction for compensation expense. Payments in shares will be valued at the fair market value of the shares at the time of the payment, and upon the subsequent disposition of the shares, the participant will recognize a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss in the amount of the difference between the sales price of the shares and the participant's tax basis in the shares. 
 Section 409A of the Code.    Certain types of awards under the Restated Plan may constitute, or provide for, a deferral of compensation under Section 409A. Unless certain requirements set forth in Section 409A are complied with, holders of such awards may be taxed earlier than would otherwise be the case (e.g., at the time of vesting instead of the time of payment) and may be subject to an additional 20% federal income tax (and, potentially, certain interest penalties). To the extent applicable, the Restated Plan and awards

granted under the Restated Plan will be structured and interpreted to comply with Section 409A and the Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance that may be issued pursuant to Section 409A. 
 Section 162(m) Limitation.    In general, under Section 162(m), income tax deductions of publicly-held corporations may be limited to the extent total compensation (including base salary, annual bonus, stock option exercises and non-qualified benefits paid) for certain executive officers exceeds $1 million (less the amount of any "excess parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code) in any one year. Prior to the TCJA, covered employees generally consisted of our Chief Executive Officer and each of the next three highest compensated officers serving at the end of the taxable year other than our Chief Financial Officer, and compensation that qualified as "performance- 
based" under Section 162(m) was exempt from this $1 million deduction limitation. As part of the TCJA, the ability to rely on this exemption was, with certain limited exceptions, eliminated; in addition, the definition of covered employees was expanded to generally include all named executive officers. Certain awards under the Existing Plan granted prior to November 2, 2017 may be grandfathered from the changes made by the TCJA under certain limited transition relief, however, for grants after that date and any grants which are not grandfathered, we will no longer be able to take a deduction for any compensation in excess of $1 million that is paid to a covered employee. There is no guarantee that we will be able to take a deduction for any compensation in excess of $1 million that is paid to a covered employee under the Existing Plan or the Restated Plan. 
   New Plan Benefits  
The following table sets forth the awards granted to the individuals and groups identified below under the Existing Plan since its inception through December 14, 2018 that remained outstanding as of such date. No awards have been granted to date under the Restated Plan as it does not become effective until shareholder approval. 
All other future grants under the Restated Plan are within the discretion of our Board of Directors or the Executive Compensation Committee and the benefits of such grants are, therefore, not determinable.

    PROPOSAL 5: CONFIRMATION OF SELECTION OF   INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC   ACCOUNTANTS
The Board Recommends That You Vote "FOR" This Proposal
Ernst & Young LLP has audited the Company's books and records since 1959 and continues as its auditors. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the shareholders' meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board is seeking your confirmation of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Our organizational documents do not require that our shareholders confirm the selection of our independent auditors. We are doing so because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit and Compliance Committee will investigate the reasons for rejection and reconsider whether or not to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but still may retain them. Even if the selection is confirmed, the Audit and Compliance Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
 Principal Accountant Fees and  Services  
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to us by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent auditor, for 2018 and 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Audit Fees(1)           ​                4,988,000          ​                 5,069,000   
 Audit-Related Fees(2)     136,000     102,000   
         Tax Fees(3)          ​                172,000             ​                 259,000   
 All Other Fees(4)     5,000     3,000    
[END TABLE]
 Other Matters  
The Audit and Compliance Committee has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP. The policy generally requires pre-approval of specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services, and tax services, up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Committee's approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditor or on an individual explicit case-by-case basis before the independent auditor is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Committee's members, but the decision must be reported to the full Committee at its next scheduled meeting. During fiscal years 2018 and 2017 the Committee did not waive any requirement for pre-approval of any services by Ernst & Young LLP. The Committee approved all auditor services and fees as required by laws in effect at the time the services were commenced.

    DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER   PROPOSALS
Proposals of shareholders intended to be included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the Company's annual meeting of shareholders expected to be held in 2020 must be received by the Corporate Secretary, Cubic Corporation, 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, no later than September 20, 2019, unless the date of the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Company's 2019 annual meeting, in which case the deadline for such proposals will be a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and send its proxy materials. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for such proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement. 
The Company's bylaws set forth certain procedures which shareholders must follow in order to nominate a director or present any other business at an annual shareholders' meeting. Generally, a shareholder must give timely notice to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, such notice must be received by the Company at its principal executive offices not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (i.e., not earlier than October 21, 2019 and not later than November 20, 2019 for the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders), provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice must be received not earlier than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting, or, if later, the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was first made. The bylaws specify the requirements as to form and substance of such shareholder notice. Details of such provisions of the bylaws may be obtained by any shareholder from the Secretary of the Company. 
    ANNUAL REPORT
The Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 will be sent to shareholders of record on or about January 18, 2019. The Annual Report does not constitute, and should not be considered, a part of this proxy solicitation material. 
Any person who was a beneficial owner of the Company's common stock on the record date may request a copy of the  
Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and it will be furnished without charge upon receipt of a written request identifying the person so requesting a report as a shareholder of the Company at such date. Requests should be directed to Cubic Corporation, 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
    SHAREHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS
The rules promulgated by the SEC permit companies, brokers, banks or other intermediaries to deliver a single copy of a proxy statement and Annual Report to households at which two or more shareholders reside. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs as well as natural resources. Shareholders sharing an address who have been previously notified by their broker, bank or other intermediary and have consented to householding will receive only one copy of the Company's proxy statement and Annual Report. If you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings and receive separate proxy statements and Annual Reports for each shareholder sharing the same address, please contact your broker, bank or other intermediary. You may also obtain a separate proxy statement or Annual Report without charge by sending a written request to Cubic Corporation, 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The Company will promptly send additional copies of the proxy statement or Annual Report upon receipt of such request. Shareholders sharing an address that are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement or Annual Report can request delivery of a single copy of the proxy statement or Annual Report by contacting their broker, bank or other intermediary or sending a written request to Cubic Corporation at the address above.

    OTHER MATTERS
The expense of preparing, printing and mailing the proxy materials and all other expenses of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mails, the directors, officers and regular employees of the Company, who will receive no compensation in addition to their regular salary, if any, may solicit proxies. The Company will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks, trustees, nominees and other persons for their expenses in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial owners of shares held by them of record. 
Management knows of no business which will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than that stated in the Notice of Annual Meeting. However, if any such matter shall properly come before the meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy form will vote the same in accordance with their best judgment.

    ARTICLE 4.        GRANTING OF AWARDs         
4.1    Participation.    The Administrator may, from time to time, select from among all Eligible Individuals, those to whom an Award shall be granted and shall determine the nature and amount of each Award, which shall not be inconsistent with the requirements of the Plan. No Eligible Individual shall have any right to be granted an Award pursuant to the Plan. 
4.2    Award Agreement.    Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for such Award, which may include the term of the Award, the provisions applicable in the event of the Participant's Termination of Service, and the Company's authority to unilaterally or bilaterally amend, modify, suspend, cancel or rescind an Award. Award Agreements evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 
4.3    Limitations Applicable to Section 16 Persons.    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award granted or awarded to any individual who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and any amendments thereto) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule. 
4.4    At-Will Employment; Voluntary Participation.    Nothing in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of, or as a Director or Consultant for, the Company or any Subsidiary, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and any Subsidiary, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, and with or without notice, or to terminate or change all other terms and conditions of employment or engagement, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between the Participant and the Company or any Subsidiary. Participation by each Participant in the Plan shall be voluntary and nothing in the Plan shall be construed as mandating that any Eligible Individual shall participate in the Plan. 
4.5    Foreign Holders.    Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in countries other than the United States in which the Company or any Subsidiary operates or has Employees, Non-Employee Directors or Consultants, or in order to comply with the requirements of any foreign securities exchange, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to: (a) determine which Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (b) determine which Eligible Individuals outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan; (c) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Eligible Individuals outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws or listing requirements of any such foreign securities exchange; (d) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable (any such subplans and/or modifications shall be attached to the Plan as appendices); provided, however, that no such subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitations contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.3; and (e) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or approvals or listing requirements of any such foreign securities exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate Applicable Law. For purposes of the Plan, all references to foreign laws, rules, regulations or taxes shall be references to the laws, rules, regulations and taxes of any applicable jurisdiction other than the United States or a political subdivision thereof. 
4.6    Non-Employee Director Awards.    The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may provide that Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors shall be granted pursuant to a written nondiscretionary formula established by the Administrator (the "Non-Employee Director Compensation Program"), subject to the limitations of the Plan. The Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Program shall set forth the type of Award(s) to be granted to Non-Employee Directors, the number of Shares to be subject to Non-Employee Director Awards (subject to the limits of the Plan), the conditions on which such Awards shall be granted, become exercisable and/or payable and expire, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion. The Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Program may be modified by the Administrator from time to time in its sole discretion. 
4.7    Stand-Alone and Tandem Awards.    Awards granted pursuant to the Plan may, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, any other Award granted pursuant to the Plan. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards. 
    ARTICLE 5.        PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS INTENDED TO QUALIFY AS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION         
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award, with respect to any Award which is intended to continue to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation (as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code prior to its repeal) pursuant to the transition relief rules in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, to the extent any of the provisions of the Plan or any Award (or any amendments hereto pursuant to this amendment and restatement of the Plan) would cause such Awards to fail to so qualify, any such provisions shall not apply to such Awards to the extent necessary to ensure the such Awards continue to so qualify. In addition, any Award which is intended to continue to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation (as described in Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code prior to its repeal) pursuant to the transition relief rules in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 shall be subject to any additional limitations as the Administrator determines necessary for such Award to continue to so qualify. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and the Plan and any such Awards shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.

APPENDIX B: AMENDED AND RESTATED CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
    ARTICLE 6.        OPTIONS         
6.1    Granting of Options to Eligible Individuals.    The Administrator is authorized to grant Options to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its sole discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, which shall not be inconsistent with the Plan. 
6.2    Option Exercise Price.    The exercise price per Share subject to each Option shall be set by the Administrator, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). In addition, in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). 
6.3    Option Vesting.    
6.4    Manner of Exercise.    All or a portion of an exercisable Option shall be deemed exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of the Company, the stock administrator of the Company or such other person or entity designated by the Administrator, or his, her or its office, as applicable: 
6.5    Partial Exercise.    An exercisable Option may be exercised in whole or in part. However, an Option shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional Shares unless otherwise determined by the Administrator and the Administrator may require that, by the terms of the Option, a partial exercise must be with respect to a minimum number of shares. 
6.6    Option Term.    The term of each Option (the "Option Term") shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Option Term shall not be more than 10 years from the date the Option is granted, or five years from the date an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder. The Administrator shall determine the time period, including the time period following a Termination of Service, during which the Participant has the right to exercise the vested Options, which time period may not extend beyond the last day of the Option Term. Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or the first sentence of this Section 6.6, the Administrator may extend the Option Term of any outstanding Option, and may extend the time period during which vested Options may be exercised, in connection with any Termination of Service of the Participant, and may amend, subject to Section 13.1, any other term or condition of such Option relating to such a Termination of Service. 
6.7    Qualification of Incentive Stock Options.    No Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any person who is not an Employee of the Company or any subsidiary corporation (as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code) of the Company. No person who qualifies as a Greater Than 10% Stockholder may be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code. Any Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan may be modified by the Administrator, with the consent of the Participant, to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of stock with respect to which "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, but without regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year under the Plan, and all other plans of the Company and any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof (each as defined in Section 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code, respectively), exceeds $100,000, the Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code. The rule set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied by taking Options and other "incentive stock options" into account in the order in which they were granted and the Fair Market Value of stock shall be determined as of the time the respective options were granted. 
6.8    Notification Regarding Disposition.    The Participant shall give the Company prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition of Shares acquired by exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which occurs within (a) two years from the date of granting (including the date the Option is

modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) such Option to such Participant, or (b) one year after the transfer of such Shares to such Participant. 
6.9    Substitute Awards.    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 6 to the contrary, in the case of an Option that is a Substitute Award, the price per share of the Shares subject to such Option may be less than the Fair Market Value per share on the date of grant; provided that the exercise price of any Substitute Award shall be determined in accordance with the applicable requirements of Sections 424 and 409A of the Code. 
    ARTICLE 7.        RESTRICTED STOCK         
7.1    Award of Restricted Stock.    
7.2    Rights as Stockholders.    Subject to Section 7.4, upon issuance of Restricted Stock, the Participant shall have, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, all the rights of a stockholder with respect to said Shares, subject to the restrictions in each individual Award Agreement, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect to the Shares; provided, however, that, in the sole discretion of the Administrator, any extraordinary distributions with respect to the Shares shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.3. In addition, with respect to a share of Restricted Stock subject to vesting, dividends which are paid prior to vesting shall only be paid out to the Participant to the extent that the vesting conditions are subsequently satisfied and the share of Restricted Stock vests. 
7.3    Restrictions.    All shares of Restricted Stock (including any shares received by Participants thereof with respect to shares of Restricted Stock as a result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization) shall, in the terms of each individual Award Agreement, be subject to such restrictions and vesting requirements as the Administrator shall provide. Such restrictions may include, without limitation, restrictions concerning voting rights and transferability and such restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such times and pursuant to such circumstances or based on such criteria as selected by the Administrator, including, without limitation, criteria based on the Participant's duration of employment, directorship or consultancy with the Company, the Performance Criteria, Company performance, individual performance or other criteria selected by the Administrator. By action taken after the Restricted Stock is issued, the Administrator may, on such terms and conditions as it may determine to be appropriate, accelerate the vesting of such Restricted Stock by removing any or all of the restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable Award Agreement. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, Restricted Stock may not be sold or encumbered until all restrictions are terminated or expire. 
7.4    Repurchase or Forfeiture of Restricted Stock.    Except as otherwise determined by the Administrator at the time of the grant of the Award or thereafter, (a) if no purchase price was paid by the Participant for the Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service, the Participant's rights in unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions shall lapse and be forfeited, and such Restricted Stock shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled without consideration, and (b) if a purchase price was paid by the Participant for the Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service, the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the Participant the unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash price per share equal to the price paid by the Participant for such Restricted Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the applicable Award Agreement. The Administrator in its sole discretion may provide that, upon certain events, including without limitation a Change in Control, the Participant's death, retirement or disability, any other specified Termination of Service or any other event, the Participant's rights in unvested Restricted Stock shall not terminate, such Restricted Stock shall vest and cease to be forfeitable and, if applicable, the Company shall cease to have a right of repurchase. 
7.5    Certificates for Restricted Stock.    Restricted Stock granted pursuant to the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Administrator shall determine. Certificates or book entries evidencing shares of Restricted Stock shall include an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. The Company, in its sole discretion, may (a) retain physical possession of any stock certificate evidencing shares of Restricted Stock until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and/or (b) require that the stock certificates evidencing shares of Restricted Stock be held in custody by a designated escrow agent (which may but need not be the Company) until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed and that the Participant deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to such Restricted Stock. 
7.6    Section 83(b) Election.    If a Participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted Stock as of the date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates upon which the Participant would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the Code, the Participant shall be required to deliver a copy of such election to the Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service.

8.3    Vesting of Restricted Stock Units.    At the time of grant, the Administrator shall specify the date or dates on which the Restricted Stock Units shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and may specify such conditions to vesting as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, vesting based upon the Participant's duration of service to the Company or any Subsidiary, one or more Performance Criteria, Company performance, individual performance or other specific criteria, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods, as determined by the Administrator. 
8.4    Maturity and Payment.    At the time of grant, the Administrator shall specify the maturity date applicable to each grant of Restricted Stock Units, which shall be no earlier than the vesting date or dates of the Award and may be determined at the election of the Participant (if permitted by the applicable Award Agreement); provided that, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator and set forth in any applicable Award Agreement, the maturity date relating to each Restricted Stock Unit shall not occur following the later of (a) the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the applicable portion of the Restricted Stock Unit vests; or (b) the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the applicable portion of the Restricted Stock Unit vests. On the maturity date, the Company shall, subject to Section 11.4, transfer to the Participant one unrestricted, fully transferable Share for each Restricted Stock Unit scheduled to be paid out on such date and not previously forfeited, or in the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such Shares on the maturity date or a combination of cash and Common Stock as determined by the Administrator. 
8.5    No Rights as a Stockholder.

Shares underlying a Stock Payment which is subject to a vesting schedule or other conditions or criteria set by the Administrator shall not be issued until those conditions have been satisfied. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, a Participant of a Stock Payment shall have no rights as a Company stockholder with respect to such Stock Payment until such time as the Stock Payment has vested and the Shares underlying the Award have been issued to the Participant. Stock Payments may, but are not required to, be made in lieu of base salary, bonus, fees or other cash compensation otherwise payable to such Eligible Individual.

    ARTICLE 11.              ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AWARDS         
11.1    Payment.    The Administrator shall determine the methods by which payments by any Participant with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan shall be made, including, without limitation: (a) cash or check, (b) Shares (including, in the case of payment of the exercise price of an Award, Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Award) held for such period of time as may be required by the Administrator in order to avoid adverse accounting consequences, in each case, having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the aggregate payments required, (c) delivery of a written or electronic notice that the Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an Award, and that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the aggregate payments required; provided that payment of such proceeds is then made to the Company upon settlement of such sale, or (d) any other form of legal consideration acceptable to the Administrator in its sole discretion. The Administrator shall also determine the methods by which Shares shall be delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant who is a Director or an "executive officer" of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to such payment, with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act. 
11.2    Tax Withholding.    The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including the Participant's FICA, employment tax or other social security contribution obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event concerning a Participant arising as a result of the Plan. The Administrator shall determine the methods by which payments by any Participant with respect to the tax withholding obligations with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan shall be made, which methods may include any of the methods permitted under Section 11.1 above. Without limiting the foregoing, the Administrator, in its sole discretion and in satisfaction of the foregoing requirement, may withhold, or allow a Participant to elect to have the Company withhold, Shares otherwise issuable under an Award (or allow the surrender of Shares). The number of Shares which may be so withheld or surrendered may not exceed the number of Shares which have a fair market value on the date of withholding or surrender equal to the aggregate amount of such tax withholding liabilities based on the maximum individual statutory tax rate in the applicable jurisdiction at the time of such withholding (or such other rate as may be required to avoid the liability classification of the applicable award under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America) and, to the extent such Shares were acquired by the Participant from the Company as compensation, the shares must have been held for the minimum period required by applicable accounting rules to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes; provided, that, such shares shall be rounded up to the nearest whole Share to the extent rounding up to the nearest whole share does not result in the liability classification of the applicable Award under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value of the Shares, consistent with applicable provisions of the Code, for tax withholding obligations due in connection with a broker-assisted cashless Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of Shares to pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or any tax withholding obligation. 
11.3    Transferability of Awards.

Subject to Section 13.2, the Administrator shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, (a) authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right to reduce its price per share, or (b) cancel any Option or Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for cash or another Award when the Option or Stock Appreciation Right price per share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares. Subject to Section 13.2, the Administrator shall have the authority, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, to amend any outstanding Award to increase the price per share or to cancel and replace an Award with the grant of an Award having a price per share that is greater than or equal to the price per share of the original Award. Furthermore, for purposes of this Section 11.6, except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price per share of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price per share that is less than the exercise price per share of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights without the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

APPENDIX B: AMENDED AND RESTATED CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN  
    ARTICLE 12.              ADMINISTRATION         
12.1    Administrator.    The Committee (or another committee or a subcommittee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall administer the Plan (except as otherwise permitted herein). To the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and with respect to Awards that are intended to be Performance-Based Compensation, including Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the Committee (or another committee or subcommittee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall take all action with respect to such Awards, and the individuals taking such action and, unless otherwise determined by the Board, shall consist solely of two or more members of the Board appointed by and holding office at the pleasure of the Board, each of whom is intended to qualify as a "non-employee director" as defined by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or any successor rule. Additionally, to the extent required by Applicable Law, each of the individuals constituting the Committee (or another committee or subcommittee of the Board assuming the functions of the Committee under the Plan) shall be an "independent director" under the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any action taken by the Committee shall be valid and effective, whether or not members of the Committee at the time of such action are later determined not to have satisfied the requirements for membership set forth in this Section 12.1 or otherwise provided in any charter of the Committee. Except as may otherwise be provided in any charter of the Committee, appointment of Committee members shall be effective upon acceptance of appointment. Committee members may resign at any time by delivering written or electronic notice to the Board. Vacancies in the Committee may only be filled by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the full Board, acting by a majority of its members in office, shall conduct the general administration of the Plan with respect to Awards granted to Non-Employee Directors and, with respect to such Awards, the terms "Administrator" and "Committee" as used in the Plan shall be deemed to refer to the Board and (b) the Board or Committee may delegate its authority hereunder to the extent permitted by Section 12.6. Should any Awards made under the Plan prior to November 2, 2017, be intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code prior to its repeal, then all such determinations regarding such Awards will be made solely by a Committee comprised solely of two of more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
12.2    Duties and Powers of Committee.    It shall be the duty of the Committee to conduct the general administration of the Plan in accordance with its provisions. The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and Award Agreements, and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are not inconsistent therewith, to interpret, amend or revoke any such rules and to amend any Award Agreement; provided that the rights or obligations of the Participant of the Award that is the subject of any such Award Agreement are not impaired by such amendment, unless the consent of the Participant is obtained or such amendment is otherwise permitted under Section 11.5, Section 13.2 or Section 13.10. Any such grant or award under the Plan need not be the same with respect to each Participant. Any such interpretations and rules with respect to Incentive Stock Options shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. In its sole discretion, the Board may at any time and from time to time exercise any and all rights and duties of the Committee under the Plan except with respect to matters which under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any successor rule, or the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded are required to be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. 
12.3    Action by the Committee.    Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Committee, a majority of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present, and acts approved in writing by all members of the Committee in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Committee. Each member of the Committee is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, the Company's independent certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan. 
12.4    Authority of Administrator.    Subject to the Company's Bylaws, the Committee's Charter and any specific designation in the Plan, the Administrator has the exclusive power, authority and sole discretion to:

APPENDIX B: AMENDED AND RESTATED CUBIC CORPORATION 2015 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN
12.5    Decisions Binding.    The Administrator's interpretation of the Plan, any Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, and any Award Agreement and all decisions and determinations by the Administrator with respect to the Plan are final, binding and conclusive on all parties. 
12.6    Delegation of Authority.    To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Board or Committee may from time to time delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board or one or more officers of the Company the authority to grant or amend Awards or to take other administrative actions pursuant to this Article 12; provided, however, that in no event shall an officer of the Company be delegated the authority to grant awards to, or amend awards held by, or take administrative actions with respect to Awards held by, the following individuals: (a) individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or (b) officers of the Company (or Directors) to whom authority to grant or amend Awards has been delegated hereunder; provided, further, that any delegation of administrative authority shall only be permitted to the extent it is permissible under Applicable Law. Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Board or Committee specifies at the time of such delegation, and the Board may at any time rescind the authority so delegated or appoint a new delegatee. At all times, the delegatee appointed under this Section 12.6 shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Board and the Committee. 
    ARTICLE 13.              MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS         
13.1    Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan.    Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13.1, the Plan may be wholly or partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time or from time to time by the Board or the Committee. However, without approval of the Company's stockholders given within twelve (12) months before or after the action by the Administrator, no action of the Administrator may, except as provided in Section 13.2, (a) increase the limits imposed in Section 3.1 on the maximum number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Incentive Stock Options under the Plan, or the individual Award limits imposed in Section 3.3, (b) reduce the price per share of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan or take any action prohibited under Section 11.6, or (c) cancel any Option or Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for cash or another Award in violation of Section 11.6. Except as provided in Section 11.5, Section 13.2 or Section 13.10, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted or awarded, unless the Award itself otherwise expressly so provides. No Awards may be granted or awarded during any period of suspension or after termination of the Plan, and in no event may any Award (including any Incentive Stock Option) be granted under the Plan after December 18, 2028 (the "Expiration Date"). Any Awards that are outstanding on the Expiration Date shall remain in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement. 
13.2    Changes in Common Stock or Assets of the Company, Acquisition or Liquidation of the Company and Other Corporate Events.

This amended and restated Plan shall be submitted for the approval of the Company's stockholders within 12 months after the date of the Board's adoption of this amended and restated Plan. If this amended and restated Plan is not approved by the Company's stockholders, this amended and restated Plan shall not become effective and the Original Plan shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

13.4    No Stockholders Rights.    Except as otherwise provided herein, a Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the Participant becomes the record owner of such Shares. 
13.5    Paperless Administration.    In the event that the Company establishes, for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Participant may be permitted through the use of such an automated system. 
13.6    Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans.    The adoption of the Plan shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the right of the Company or any Subsidiary: (a) to establish any other forms of incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper corporate purpose including without limitation, the grant or assumption of options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm or association. 
13.7    Compliance with Laws.    The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment of money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to state, federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to Applicable Law. 
13.8    Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange Act.    The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control. References to sections of the Code or the Exchange Act shall include any amendment or successor thereto. 
13.9    Governing Law.    The Plan and any agreements hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof or of any other jurisdiction. 
13.10    Section 409A.    To the extent that the Administrator determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section 409A of the Code. To the extent applicable, the Plan and any Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Restatement Effective Date. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Restatement Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code (including Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Restatement Effective Date), the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section. 
13.11    No Rights to Awards.    No Eligible Individual or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award pursuant to the Plan, and neither the Company nor the Administrator is obligated to treat Eligible Individuals, Participants or any other persons uniformly. 
13.12    Unfunded Status of Awards.    The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Award Agreement shall give the Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary. 
13.13    Indemnification.    To the extent allowable pursuant to Applicable Law and the Company's charter and bylaws, each member of the Administrator shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company's charter or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
13.14    Relationship to other Benefits.    No payment pursuant to the Plan shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing, group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement thereunder. 
13.15    Expenses.    The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company and its Subsidiaries.
