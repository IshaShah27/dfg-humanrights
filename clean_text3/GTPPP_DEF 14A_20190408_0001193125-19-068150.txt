GOOD YEAR Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement APRIL 8, 2019 AKRON, OHIO 
INNOVATION EXCELLENCE Develop great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers SALES & MARKETING EXCELLENCE Build the value of our brand, help our customers win in their markets, and become consumers' preferred choice OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Relentlessly improve our quality and efficiency to deliver the right tire, to the right place, at the right time for the right cost Winning at the intersection is the key to success HOW WE'LL WIN 
March 8, 2019 
Dear Fellow Goodyear Shareholder, 
Thank you for your continued investment in Goodyear. I and the rest of the Board of Directors invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
In 2018, our business teams delivered several operational wins. Most notably, we recovered consumer replacement volume in our key mature markets, led by above-industry growth in the high-margin 17-inch and greater category in the U.S. and Europe. Our commercial truck tire shipments increased, as a strong commercial product portfolio and a suite of industry-leading fleet solutions allowed us to benefit from the positive momentum in the transportation industry. Globally, we added to our OE pipeline by securing numerous new fitments, with many on electric vehicles. 
We also achieved several strategic objectives during the year, three of which enhance our preparedness for the changes we see coming in the ways that tires are bought and sold: 
Changing consumer preferences have led to the creation of entirely new companies, new business models and new categories. TireHub, Goodyear Mobile Install, and Roll by Goodyear reflect our response to this changing consumer behavior as it relates to the tire buying process. Each of these formats strengthens our Connected Business Model, which is designed to move us closer to our customers and consumers, allowing us to improve our service levels today while positioning us to be a leader in the changing mobility landscape. 
These accomplishments were tempered by the increasing macroeconomic headwinds the tire industry faced as the year progressed, including rising raw material costs, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and softening industry conditions in emerging markets — most notably China and Brazil. These challenges dampened our financial results in 2018. 
While our financial performance fell short of our goals, we are exceeding our performance from the previous industry cycle despite a turbulent environment. This is confirmation that our strategy is working and that our investments are strengthening our competitive position in the market, helping us deliver higher highs and higher lows at each point in the industry cycle. 
We head into 2019 with a focus on execution, with product and business model innovation as a priority, and with an understanding that we need to intensify our focus on factors we can control, including our costs and cash flow in light of the realities of today's challenging macroeconomic backdrop. However, it is also important to ensure that we are running the business for the long term. We must leverage our brand, our products, our people, and our innovation to capitalize on the market opportunities that are being created by population and income growth around the globe, as well as the disruption that is occurring in the auto industry. 
A new mobility ecosystem is changing the underpinnings of the auto industry in ways unimaginable only a few years ago; however, I remain even more optimistic about our future. We have a remarkable set of assets: a powerful brand, dedicated associates, a culture of innovation, the strongest portfolio of products in our history, an aligned retail and distribution network, and a growing portfolio of premium OE fitments. The combination of these elements drives value for our customers and consumers and is where Goodyear continues to demonstrate its competitive advantage as the mobility revolution unfolds. 
We will maintain our unwavering commitment to our long-term strategy of pursuing growth in the industry's most attractive market segments and ensuring that we capture the value of our Connected Business Model. This focus, combined with our relentless commitment to capital stewardship, will underpin our ability to create sustainable shareholder value going forward. 
On behalf of our Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support. We look forward to welcoming you at our annual meeting. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Dear Fellow Goodyear Shareholder, 
I am honored and proud to serve as Goodyear's independent Lead Director. Your Board of Directors sets high standards for Goodyear's employees, officers and directors and promotes a corporate culture that is committed to acting with honesty, integrity and respect in all that we do. "Protect Our Good Name" is more than just a slogan — it is an integral part of the way we do business. As a Board, we are committed to representing your interests by providing appropriate oversight and delivering on our long-term strategy to achieve profitable growth. It has been an active year, and I want to update you on some of the key areas on which the Board has been focused. 
BOARD CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE 
Our Board of Directors is comprised of committed, qualified and diverse individuals who bring a wealth of experience and perspectives to their roles as the stewards of our Company and your investment in Goodyear. Our directors' deep and diverse skill sets and thought leadership have been an invaluable resource to me, our Chairman and the Goodyear management team in establishing our long-term business strategy and in executing on that strategy. I am happy with the recent addition of Tom Williams to the Board. Tom is currently the CEO and Chairman of Parker-Hannifin Corporation, and he brings to our Board extensive senior executive leadership experience, especially with respect to the operations of complex, global businesses. I am grateful to work with such capable and dedicated individuals in the pursuit of long-term shareholder value creation. I encourage you to support each of the Board's nominees on this year's ballot. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
We are focused on key governance practices of importance to our shareholders. Our Board leadership structure is one of those areas. The Board, after thoughtful evaluation, continues to believe that a combined Chairman-CEO role, accompanied by a strong independent Lead Director role, is the leadership structure that best serves the interests of Goodyear and our shareholders. Our Board continues to provide strong, independent oversight of management. In my role as independent Lead Director, I am empowered to provide independent leadership for our Board and am fully committed to fulfilling those responsibilities on your behalf. 
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR SHAREHOLDERS 
Our Board of Directors values the feedback and insights gained from frequent engagement with our shareholders. In 2018, I met with several of our largest shareholders to discuss the challenging industry dynamics we faced in 2018, how our strategy will enable us to drive future growth in our business, and the Board's role in overseeing that strategy. We also discussed how the Board thinks about its composition and refreshment, the Board's independent oversight of management, our commitment to aligning pay with performance, key sustainability initiatives, and our sound corporate governance and corporate responsibility practices. We remain committed to including our shareholders' perspectives in boardroom discussions, and we believe that regular engagement with our shareholders is necessary to ensure thoughtful and informed consideration of your views on matters of importance to our business. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
We remain committed to maintaining a strong alignment between company performance and our executive compensation program. As you read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, we believe you will see the alignment of our incentive compensation plans with the Company's performance — as payouts under those plans were significantly below target, demonstrating our strong pay for performance philosophy. 
I appreciate your ongoing confidence in Goodyear and the Board of Directors. We remain committed to serving your interests, and we appreciate the opportunity to serve Goodyear on your behalf. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

We have a pervasive distribution network that is focused on making the tire buying process easier — with over 13,000 retail touch points, a concentrated network of aligned third-party distributors, approximately 200 company-owned warehouse distribution facilities, and a leading business-to-consumer e-commerce platform. 
We manufacture our products in 47 manufacturing facilities in 21 countries, including the United States, and we have marketing operations in almost every country around the world. We employ approximately 64,000 full-time and temporary associates worldwide.

2018 Business Performance Highlights 
EBIT* $1,267 MILLION NET INCOME* $568 MILLION FREE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS* $393 MILLION TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN* 5th%ILE OF S&P 500 SHAREHOLDER RETURN PROGRAM $358 MILLION *As defined for purposes of our compensation plans in 2018 
Our performance fell short of our goals in 2018 as we continued to experience challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds due to a strong U.S. dollar, and volatility in emerging markets, including softening industry conditions in China. These factors more than offset the benefits of increased demand for our consumer replacement tires in the United States and Europe, driven by sales of 17-inch and above rim size tires that outperformed the industry. 
We are not satisfied with our overall performance in 2018, and we will intensify our efforts to improve execution in the areas of our business that are largely within our control, including gross cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. The restructuring plan that we expect to unveil during the first half of 2019 will underpin the next wave of our cost savings and strengthen our long-term competitive position in the market. 
We remain committed to our strategy which is aimed at capturing profitable growth in attractive market segments, particularly in 17-inch and above rim size tires, mastering increasing complexity and turning that into a competitive advantage, and connecting with consumers through our aligned distribution network of distributors and dealers. 
In order to drive this future growth and address the challenging industry environment, we remain focused on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Developing great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers;  
• Building the value of our brand, helping our customers win in their markets, and becoming consumers' preferred choice;  and  
• Relentlessly improving our quality and efficiency to deliver the right tire, to the right place, at the right time for the  right cost.  
[END TABLE]
Our strategy is designed to take advantage of the long-term trends shaping our industry, particularly in the larger rim size segment of the market. 
During 2018, we formed a 50/50 joint venture with Bridgestone Americas, Inc. ("Bridgestone") that combined our company-owned wholesale distribution business and Bridgestone's tire wholesale warehouse business to create TireHub, LLC ("TireHub"), our sole authorized national tire distributor in the United States. TireHub will provide U.S. tire dealers and retailers with a comprehensive range of passenger and light truck tires from two of the world's leading tire companies, with an emphasis on satisfying the rapidly growing demand for larger rim diameter premium tires. 
We also announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share, beginning with the December 3, 2018 payment date.

Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that it is important for us to communicate regularly with shareholders regarding areas of interest or concern. We have a robust shareholder engagement program that includes an annual outreach that is focused on our long-term business strategy, executive compensation, corporate governance, corporate responsibility and other topics suggested by our shareholders. This annual outreach helps to ensure that our shareholders are heard and able to communicate directly with us on these important matters. The following chart demonstrates our long-standing commitment to a robust shareholder engagement program: 
Commitment to Shareholder Engagement (as a% of outstanding Common Stock) 
As part of our 2018 annual outreach (based on our outstanding Common Stock as of September 30, 2018): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We requested the opportunity to meet with many of our shareholders;  
• We ultimately engaged with shareholders representing over 50% of our Common Stock; and  
• Our independent Lead Director met with several of our largest shareholders (representing approximately 33% of our Common  Stock) to provide a direct line of communication between our shareholders and the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
Specifically, our outreach meetings this year gave us the chance to discuss: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the challenging industry dynamics we faced in 2018,  
• how our strategy will enable us to drive future growth in our business,  
• the Board's role in overseeing that strategy,  
• how the Board thinks about its composition and refreshment,  
• the Lead Director's and Board's independent oversight of management,  
• our commitment to aligning pay with performance,  
• an update on key sustainability initiatives, such as the Sustainable Natural Rubber Initiative, and  
• our sound executive compensation, corporate governance and corporate responsibility practices.

Our executive compensation program is designed to support achievement of our business objectives and to serve the long-term interests of our shareholders. Our executive compensation is strongly aligned to company performance and measurable

 financial metrics, thereby aligning management's interests with our shareholders' interests by focusing management on driving increased shareholder value. 
The payouts under our incentive compensation plans this year were strongly aligned with our financial and stock price performance — demonstrating our commitment to structure an executive compensation program that pays for performance — as the payouts under those plans were significantly lower than in prior years. 
Our CEO's actual payouts under our annual incentive plan over the past three years are aligned with our EBIT and Free Cash Flow from Operations performance over those periods, as shown in the graphic below. For 2018, there were no payouts for overall company performance under our annual incentive plans or the 2018 performance period under our long-term incentive plans. In 2018, our relative total shareholder return, or TSR, modifier reduced the payouts for our 2016-2018 performance cycle by 20% as well.

Spotlight on Independent Board Oversight 
In order to ensure that the independent and non-management members of the Board maintain proper oversight of management on behalf of our shareholders, the Board has an independent Lead Director who is elected annually by the independent members of the Board. The election of a Lead Director by the independent members of the Board demonstrates the Board's continuing commitment to strong corporate governance, Board independence and the importance of the role of Lead Director. The Board periodically reviews the Board leadership structure and the roles of the Chairman and independent Lead Director, taking into consideration the views expressed by our shareholders. The Board believes that, especially in our changing and challenging environment, it is in the best interests of shareholders to retain the flexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership structure at any particular point in time.

Board Leadership Structure 
Mr. Kramer serves as our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President and Mr. McCollough was elected by the independent members of the Board to serve as our independent Lead Director. The Board believes that the current Board leadership structure is the most appropriate for the Company and its shareholders at this time. The Board periodically reviews the Board leadership structure and the roles of the Chairman and independent Lead Director, taking into consideration the views expressed by our shareholders. 
In order to ensure that the independent and non-management members of the Board maintain proper oversight of management on behalf of our shareholders, the Board has an independent Lead Director who is elected annually by the independent members of the Board. The election of a Lead Director by the independent members of the Board demonstrates the Board's continuing commitment to strong corporate governance, Board independence and the importance of the role of Lead Director. 
Currently, the Board believes that having Mr. Kramer serve as Chairman best positions the Company to compete successfully and advance our shareholders' interests. His extensive knowledge of the Company and the tire industry, gained through 19 years of experience in positions of increasing authority including Chief Financial Officer and President, North America, is valuable to the Board in his role as Chairman. Mr. Kramer has provided strong and open leadership of the Board as the Company executes its strategy in a highly competitive industry that continues to be challenged by volatile global economic conditions. The current combination of the Chairman and CEO roles enhances the Company's ability to coordinate the development, articulation and execution of a unified strategy at both the Board and management levels. The Board also believes that having Mr. Kramer serve as Chairman and CEO has facilitated the flow of information to, and discussion among, members of the Board regarding the Company's business. 
The Governance Committee believes that Mr. McCollough is highly qualified to serve as our Lead Director and that he provides strong leadership of the independent and non-management directors and diligently fulfills his duties as Lead Director.

Additional duties of our independent Lead Director are set forth in Annex II to our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
In addition to the clearly-delineated and comprehensive oversight responsibilities of our Lead Director, the independent directors have ample opportunity to, and regularly do, assess the performance of the CEO and provide meaningful direction to him. The Board has strong and effective independent oversight of management: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board holds executive sessions of the independent directors at each Board meeting that are led by the Lead Director.   
[END TABLE]
The Board's policy is that, especially in our changing and challenging environment, it must retain the flexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership structure at any particular point in time. As a result, the Board has the responsibility to establish our leadership structure, including in connection with any CEO succession. Some of the factors that the Board has considered, and may consider in the future, in combining or separating the Chairman and CEO roles, include:

Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Management continually monitors the material risks facing the Company, including competitive, operational, strategic, financial (accounting, liquidity and tax), legal and regulatory risks. The Board as a whole has responsibility for oversight of management's identification and management of, and planning for, those risks. Reviews of certain areas are conducted by relevant Board Committees that report their deliberations to the Board.

           Board's Role in Risk Oversight         
           Board's Role in Risk Oversight         
[END TABLE]
The Board and its Committees oversee risks associated with their principal areas of focus, as summarized below. The Board and its Committees exercise their risk oversight function by carefully evaluating the reports they receive from management and by making inquiries of management with respect to areas of particular interest to the Board. Board oversight of risk is enhanced by the fact that the Lead Director and Chairman attend virtually all Committee meetings and that Committee reports are provided to the full Board following each Committee meeting. We believe that our leadership structure also enhances the Board's risk oversight function since our Lead Director regularly discusses the material risks facing the Company with management. The Chairman is also expected to report candidly to his fellow directors on his assessment of the material risks we face, based upon the information he receives as part of his management responsibilities. Both the Lead Director and the Chairman are well-equipped to lead Board discussions on risk issues.

Consideration of Director Nominees 
The Governance Committee will consider properly submitted shareholder nominations of candidates for membership on the Board as described below under "Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Director." In evaluating nominations, the Governance Committee seeks to address the criteria described below under "Director Selection Guidelines." 
Any shareholder desiring to submit a proposed candidate for consideration by the Governance Committee should send the name of the proposed candidate, together with biographical data and background information concerning the candidate, to the Office of the Secretary, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 200 Innovation Way, Akron, Ohio 44316-0001. 
Director Selection Guidelines 
The Board of Directors has approved guidelines for selecting directors as part of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Criteria considered in the selection of directors include:

Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Director 
The Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, screening and recommending persons for nomination to the Board. The Governance Committee considers candidates for Board membership suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as management and shareholders. On occasion, the Committee also retains third-party executive search firms to identify candidates. In addition, under our prior master labor agreement with the United Steelworkers (the "USW"), the USW had the right to nominate a candidate for consideration for membership on the Board. Mr. Wessel, who became a director in December 2005, was identified and recommended by the USW. Mr. Williams was initially identified as a potential candidate for Board membership by management.

           Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Director         
[END TABLE]
Once a prospective nominee has been identified, the Committee makes an initial determination on whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate. This initial determination is based on whatever information is provided to the Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Committee's own knowledge of the prospective candidate, which may be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. The preliminary determination is based primarily on the need for additional Board members and the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the director selection guidelines described above. If the Committee determines, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board, the Lead Director and other Board members as appropriate, that additional consideration is warranted, it may request a third-party search firm to gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience and to report its findings to the Committee. The Committee then evaluates the prospective nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in Goodyear's director selection guidelines. The Committee also considers such other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the balance of management and independent directors and the evaluations of other prospective nominees. As described above under "Director Selection Guidelines," diversity is among the many factors that the Committee considers in evaluating prospective nominees. We consider the members of our Board to have a diverse set of business and personal experiences, backgrounds and expertise, and to be diverse in terms of age, gender and ethnicity. 
In connection with this evaluation, the Committee determines whether to interview the prospective nominee, and if warranted, the Lead Director, the Chairman of the Committee, one or more other members of the Committee and others as appropriate, interview prospective nominees in person or by telephone. After completing this evaluation and interview, the Committee makes a recommendation to the full Board as to the persons who should be nominated for election to the Board, and the Board makes its decision after considering the recommendation and report of the Committee. 
Board Structure and Committee Composition 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Goodyear's Board has thirteen directors, each elected annually, and the following six committees: (1) Audit, (2) Compensation, (3) Corporate Responsibility and Compliance, (4) Finance, (5) Governance, and (6) Executive.

Corporate Responsibility 
Goodyear is proud of its longstanding commitment to corporate responsibility. Our associates strive for continuous improvement in all areas of corporate responsibility for the benefit of our customers, suppliers, communities and investors, as well as the environment. 
Goodyear's Board Committee on Corporate Responsibility and Compliance oversees our corporate responsibility objectives and regularly monitors our progress toward achieving them. We also actively discuss these objectives with investors and other stakeholders, soliciting their feedback on any areas where they would like to see improvement. 
In 2018, we conducted an assessment, following an earlier assessment in 2014, to review corporate responsibility topics that are high priorities to the company and its stakeholders and to highlight opportunities for ongoing improvement. Our Corporate Responsibility Strategy has been refreshed based on this assessment. 
Progress on this strategy, shown below, is the basis for our annual Corporate Responsibility Report. Areas of focus include Sustainable Sourcing, Responsible Operations, Advanced Mobility and Inspiring Culture.

Sustainable     Sourcing           Sustainable  Raw Materials & Sourcing   Supply Chain Management      In 2018, we published our Natural  Rubber Procurement Policy which reflects our strong commitment to the responsible sourcing of raw materials. We also audited 79% of our natural rubber suppliers throughout the year, in accordance with our policy.   Following up on our award-winning breakthrough of applying soybean oil in the tread compound of  tires as a replacement for traditional petroleum oil, we released two new tires using this new technology — the Assurance WeatherReady and the Eagle Enforcer All Weather.

The Board has determined that eleven of the thirteen director nominees are independent within the meaning of Goodyear's independence standards, which are based on the criteria established by The Nasdaq Stock Market and are included as Annex I to Goodyear's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Kramer, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, is not considered independent. In addition, in light of his relationship with the USW, Mr. Wessel is not considered independent. Further, the Board expects that Mr. Wessel will recuse himself from discussions and deliberations regarding Goodyear's relationship with the USW. The Board also determined that the nature and size of the ordinary course commercial relationships between Goodyear and Parker-Hannifin Corporation did not impair the independence of Mr. Williams. The relationship was de minimis, constituting less than three one-hundredths of one percent (0.03%) of either Goodyear's or Parker-Hannifin's consolidated gross revenues in the most recent fiscal year. 
PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board of Directors has selected the following thirteen nominees recommended by the Governance Committee for election to the Board of Directors. The directors will hold office from their election until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, or until their successors are elected and qualified. If any of these nominees for director becomes unavailable, the persons named in the proxy intend to vote for an alternate designated by the current Board of Directors.

  Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR each of the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 1). 
PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
We are seeking your vote to approve, on an advisory (or non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), which starts on page 21, describes our executive compensation program. We encourage you to read the CD&A before casting your vote. 
The advisory resolution below, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you the opportunity to express your views on our executive compensation program for our named executive officers. The "say-on-pay" proposal is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the executive compensation policies, practices and plans described in this Proxy Statement. 
The resolution is required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The resolution is not intended to indicate your approval of the matters disclosed under the heading "Risks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices" or future "golden parachute" payments. We will seek shareholder approval of any "golden parachute" payments at the time of any transaction triggering those payments to the extent required by applicable law. 
We ask you to vote "FOR" the following resolution which will be presented by the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders." 
Although this proposal is an advisory vote that will not be binding on the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee will consider the results of this shareholder advisory vote and the changes, if any, to our executive compensation policies, practices and plans that may be warranted as a result of this vote. The Board of Directors has determined, consistent with the shareholders' vote on the matter in 2017, to hold an advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers every year until the next vote on the frequency of such advisory votes, which is currently expected to occur at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
  Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 2).

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Summary 
2018 OPERATING RESULTS AND OUR STRONG PAY AND PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT 
Our performance fell short of our goals in 2018 as we continued to experience challenging global industry conditions, including higher raw material costs, foreign currency headwinds due to a strong U.S. dollar, and volatility in emerging markets, including softening industry conditions in China. These factors more than offset the benefits of increased demand for our consumer replacement tires in the United States and Europe, driven by sales of 17-inch and above rim size tires that outperformed the industry. 
We are not satisfied with our overall performance in 2018, and we will intensify our efforts to improve execution in the areas of our business that are largely within our control, including gross cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. The restructuring plan that we expect to unveil during the first half of 2019 will underpin the next wave of our cost savings and strengthen our long-term competitive position in the market. 
The payouts under our incentive compensation plans were strongly aligned with our financial and stock price performance — demonstrating our commitment to structure an executive compensation program that pays for performance — as the payouts were significantly lower than in prior years.

The following summarizes key elements of the company's performance in 2018. 
Goodyear net income and SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME (in millions) TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (2016-2018) -34.5% EBIT* $2,267 MILLION NET INCOME* $568 MILLION FREE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS* $393 MILLION TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN* 5th%ILE OF S&P 500 SHAREHOLDER RETURN PROGRAM $358 MILLION * As defined for purposes of our compensation plans in 2018 
Our CEO's actual payouts under our annual incentive plan over the past three years are aligned with our EBIT and Free Cash Flow from Operations performance over those periods, as shown in the graphic below. For 2018, the payout for overall company performance under our annual incentive plans was calculated to be below our threshold performance level.

           Executive Summary         
[END TABLE]
In each of the past three years, our CEO's realized pay has been strongly aligned with our trailing three-year relative TSR performance. In 2018, our relative total shareholder return modifier (which we refer to as the "TSR modifier" and which is described in more detail on page 40) reduced the payouts for our 2016-2018 performance cycle by 20%. 
Our CEO's realized pay shows strong alignment to our stock price 
(in millions, except TSR) 1 As reported in the Summary Compensation Table beginning at page xx of this Proxy Statement. 2 Realized pay includes base salary, annual incentive earned, long term incentive to be paid out and pre-tax compensation earned upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of stock awards regardless of when they were granted. For more information on our calculation of realized pay, see Summary of Realized Pay Earned by Our Chief Executive Officer for 2016, 2017 and 2018 beginning at page xx of this Proxy Statement. 
As a result of our operating performance, we did not meet the performance thresholds for the 2018 performance periods under our 2016-2018, 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 long-term awards, and no payouts were approved for those performance periods. Our stock out-performed 5% of the companies in the S&P 500 during the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, resulting in a TSR modifier of 0.8 times, which reduced the payout for the 2016-2018 performance cycle. 
In the face of challenging global industry conditions, we remain committed to our strategy which is aimed at capturing profitable growth in attractive market segments, particularly in 17-inch and above rim size tires, mastering increasing complexity and turning that into a competitive advantage, and connecting with consumers through our aligned distribution network of distributors and dealers. 
In order to drive this future growth and address the challenging industry environment, we remain focused on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Developing great products and services that anticipate and respond to the needs of consumers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Building the value of our brand, helping our customers win in their markets, and becoming consumers' preferred choice;  and

• Relentlessly improving our quality and efficiency to deliver the right tire, to the right place, at the right time for the  right cost.

Our strategy is designed to take advantage of the long-term trends shaping our industry, particularly in the larger rim size segment of the market. 
In 2018, we once again demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns by increasing the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock by 14%, from $0.14 per share to $0.16 per share, beginning with the December 3, 2018 payment date.

2018 SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
We believe that it is important for us to communicate regularly with shareholders regarding areas of interest or concern. We have a robust shareholder engagement program that includes an annual outreach that is focused on our long-term business strategy, executive compensation, corporate governance, corporate responsibility and other topics suggested by our shareholders. This annual outreach helps to ensure that our shareholders are heard and able to communicate directly with us on these important matters. 
As part of our 2018 annual outreach, we requested the opportunity to meet with many of our shareholders, and we ultimately engaged with shareholders representing over 50% of our outstanding Common Stock as of September 30, 2018.

In 2018, our independent Lead Director met with several of our largest shareholders to provide a direct line of communication between our shareholders and the Board of Directors. Our outreach meetings gave us the chance to discuss the challenging industry dynamics we faced in 2018. Specifically, we discussed:

We received positive feedback on the structure of our executive compensation program, specifically the metrics in our annual and long-term incentive plans. This feedback was consistent with the success of last year's say on pay proposal, which was approved by 91% of our voting shareholders at our 2018 annual meeting. 
All of the shareholder feedback that we received was reported to the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors for its consideration. 
ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation for NEOs is comprised of a mix of variable and fixed compensation that is strongly linked to company performance and targeted in the aggregate to the median of the benchmark data that we use. 
For 2018, the mix of performance metrics was as follows:

In 2018, we made a few changes to our executive compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Added a new operating driver for 17-inch and above rim size tire volumes to replace  the former new product vitality operating driver to reinforce the importance of increasing profitable volume.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Replaced stock options with restricted stock units to link executives to the results earned by stockholders, to build  executive stock ownership, and to attract, incent and retain executive talent.

We believe that our compensation program is consistent with our performance-based compensation philosophy and serves the long-term interests of our shareholders. We will continue to seek feedback from our investors and consider ongoing enhancements to the program.

Compensation Philosophy 
The following core principles form the foundation of the compensation program for our executives, including the named executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 FIRST, compensation programs should motivate our executives to take actions that are aligned with our short-  and long-term strategic objectives, and appropriately balance risk versus potential reward.         SECOND, as executives move to a greater level of responsibility, the percentage of their pay based on  performance should increase to ensure the highest level of accountability to shareholders.

SECOND, as executives move to a greater level of responsibility, the percentage of their pay based on  performance should increase to ensure the highest level of accountability to shareholders.   
THIRD, performance pay should offer an opportunity for above average compensation when our performance exceeds our goals balanced by the risk of below average compensation when it does  not.       FOURTH, the percentage of total compensation paid in the form of equity should also increase as executives  have increasing responsibility for corporate performance, thereby more closely aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.

Components of Executive Compensation 
We provide executive compensation and benefits that are market-competitive in which a large portion of the total opportunity is variable and tied to our performance and changes in shareholder value over a multi-year period. The key components of compensation provided to our executive officers and how each supports our compensation objectives are presented in the following table:

Compensation Decision-Making 
The Compensation Committee undertakes ongoing review of our executive compensation policies, practices and plans to determine whether they are consistent with our compensation philosophy and objectives, and whether they need to be modified in light of changes in our business or the markets in general. The Compensation Committee meets periodically with the CEO to review compensation policies and specific levels of compensation paid to officers and other key personnel, and reports and makes recommendations to the Board regarding executive compensation policies and plans. In addition, the CEO annually makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding salary adjustments and the setting of annual and long-term incentive targets and awards for officers other than himself, including the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also obtains feedback, advice and recommendations on our compensation program from its independent compensation consultant, F.W. Cook. The Compensation Committee also reviews Company performance, compensation practices of its peers, compensation surveys and other materials regarding executive compensation. 
In determining the compensation of a named executive officer, the Compensation Committee considers various factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company performance against corporate and operating unit objectives,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's relative shareholder return,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation of officers with similar responsibilities at comparable companies,

• The awards given to the named executive officer in past years, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The relationship between the compensation to be received by the officer and the compensation to be received by the other  named executive officers (which we refer to as "internal pay equity"), including comparing the relationship to that found at comparable companies. In reviewing the CEO's compensation relative to our other named executive officers, the  Compensation Committee takes into account the fact that we do not currently have a president or chief operating officer between the CEO and our business unit presidents or corporate senior vice presidents as do many companies.

           Compensation Decision-Making         
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee generally sets "primary compensation," which we define to include salary, annual cash incentives and long-term compensation, for the CEO and the other named executive officers as follows: 
9% Salary 14% 19% 19% Salary Annual Annual Cash Cash Incentive Incentive 19% Stock Options 23% Stock 43% Options 54% Long Term Long Term Performance-Performance-Based Awards Based Awards2018 CEO'S PRIMARY COMPENSATION 2018 OTHER NEO'S PRIMARY COMPENSATION 9% Salary 14% 18% 20% Salary Annual Annual Cash Cash Incentive Incentive 19% Stock Options 23% Stock 43% Options 54% Long Term Long Term Performance-Performance-Based Awards Based Awards 
Long-term compensation is delivered through grants of restricted stock units and long-term performance-based incentive awards that are payable in shares of Common Stock and cash. The mix of long-term compensation between cash-based long-term incentives, performance shares and restricted stock units is based, in part, on the market value of our Common Stock, the number of shares available for grant under our shareholder-approved equity compensation plan, and considerations relating to managing the dilutive effect of share-based awards. 
We generally target base salaries for our CEO and other officers below median market rates, in the aggregate, consistent with the requirements of our master labor agreement with the USW, and we target annual and long-term incentive compensation at rates that, when added to base salaries, result in median market levels of target primary compensation, on average. The actual positioning of target compensation relative to the median varies based on each executive's experience and skill set, and generally results in executives who are new in their role being placed lower in the range and those with more experience being placed higher in the range. We emphasize variable compensation because it minimizes fixed expense associated with salary and enables total compensation to fluctuate directly with performance against operating goals and changes in share price. This approach aligns overall costs with performance and provides executives with a leveraged and attractive compensation opportunity that varies based on results.

Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain outside advisors, including compensation consultants, to assist it in evaluating actual and proposed compensation for our officers. During 2018, the Compensation Committee retained F.W. Cook as its independent compensation consultant. 
As part of its engagement, F.W. Cook reviewed our executive compensation peer group and conducted a competitive analysis of compensation for the named executive officers as well as our operational and stock price performance relative to the peer group. F.W. Cook also assisted the Committee with a variety of other issues, including setting CEO compensation, compensation related to leadership succession activities, the design and establishment of performance goals under our variable incentive plans, and reviewing our compensation risk analysis and this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
In addition, F.W. Cook reviewed and provided recommendations regarding our non-management director compensation program and made a presentation to the full Board on trends and regulatory developments in executive compensation. A representative of F.W. Cook regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings. F.W. Cook works with Goodyear management only under the direction of the Compensation Committee and does not provide any other advice or consulting services to the Company. 
Peer Group Benchmarking of Primary Compensation 
As noted above, the Compensation Committee generally targets primary compensation levels for officers at median market rates. For these purposes, the Compensation Committee has determined market rates by considering two sources: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy statements and other public filings of 21 peer companies; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broad-based compensation surveys published from time to time by national human resources consulting firms.

FOR 2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS, THE PEER GROUP NOTED ABOVE CONSISTED OF:

           Peer Group Benchmarking of Primary Compensation         
[END TABLE]
This peer group was selected because the companies, as a whole, represent organizations of comparable size and complexity with which we compete for executive talent. The peer group includes companies in similar industries with comparable business models and global reach. It does not include other companies in the tire industry because no other U.S.-based tire company is similar in size and complexity to us, and non-U.S.-based tire companies do not publish comparable compensation information. 
The Compensation Committee strongly believes that performance should be the primary basis on which compensation decisions are made. At the same time, the Compensation Committee believes that our peer group should reflect the fact that our executive officers are responsible for managing a larger and more complex enterprise relative to that of many other publicly traded companies with a larger market capitalization. Accordingly, in 2017, prior to analyzing competitive compensation data to help inform 2018 compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee reviewed the composition of the peer group using the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  size, including revenue, operating income, total assets, market capitalization and enterprise value;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  global manufacturing focus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  industry focus, particularly companies in the automotive industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  consumer branded product companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  companies with which we compete for executive talent; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  number of employees.  
[END TABLE]
Our peer group had 2017 annual revenues – the size criteria most strongly correlated to compensation – ranging from $8.8 billion to $39.3 billion and median revenues of $16.9 billion (for 2017, we had revenues of $15.4 billion), and had 53% and 76%, respectively, of our selected peer companies in common with the peer groups constructed by two leading proxy advisory firms. 
Following its review of the criteria described above, the Compensation Committee removed DuPont and Johnson Controls from our peer group for 2018 compensation decisions and added Adient, Air Products and Chemicals, Emerson Electric, Kimberly-Clark, Tenneco and Textron in order to expand our peer group to include a broader range of peer companies, consistent with market practice for companies who do not have many direct industry peers, and to maintain Goodyear's position near the peer group median with respect to annual revenue. The Compensation Committee may make further changes in the peer group from time to time based on the criteria described above or other relevant factors. 
Data with respect to comparable elements of primary compensation is compiled for the peer group of companies described above from available sources, including, in most cases, the most recently available annual proxy statements and other SEC filings that address executive compensation matters. 
Target Setting 
The Compensation Committee set the performance targets for our 2018 executive compensation program in February 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that the performance targets it established were rigorous, while providing meaningful motivational value to our executives. The performance targets required us to generate significant organic volume and earnings

[END TABLE]
 growth and free cash flow through 2020, while effectively managing volatility in raw material prices, a continued weak OE market, increasing inflationary pressures and the competitive environment. The achievement of the performance targets would enable us to fund our capital allocation plan, and would mean we had successfully met the significant challenges we faced, were a stronger competitor and were poised for future growth. 
The Compensation Committee considered the following factors when establishing the performance targets, including the related threshold and maximum target levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate strategy  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual and long-term operating plans  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Publicly disclosed financial targets and guidance

• Macro-economic and tire industry environment  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Input from F.W. Cook and management  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Difficulty of the targets in light of the above factors  
[END TABLE]
As in prior years, the target level of performance for the 2018 performance period under our annual and long-term incentive plans was consistent with our publicly announced earnings targets. The performance targets would be achieved, at the target performance level, if we successfully executed our operating plan for 2018 and the 2018-2020 performance cycle. The minimum level of performance was consistent with the known risks inherent in our 2018 operating plan, particularly with respect to our plan to out-perform the industry's volume growth given the competitive pricing environment in the tire industry and continued volatility in raw material prices. The maximum level of performance would be achieved if we more than offset raw material costs and inflationary headwinds through a combination of increased volume, pricing actions, product mix improvements and cost saving actions. 
ANNUAL COMPENSATION TARGETS 
The 2018 Corporate EBIT target reflected 14% growth from our 2017 actual results. Our 2018 Corporate EBIT target reflected significant volume growth, a benefit from price and product mix, net of raw material costs, and continued strong cost savings performance, net of inflation. Our goal was to have a strong recovery from disappointing performance in 2017 and to be positioned to achieve our long-term goals. 
The 2018 free cash flow from operations target of $625 million was a 20% increase over our 2017 actual results. Our 2018 free cash flow from operations target reflected a significant improvement in Corporate EBIT, as described above, that was partially offset by higher capital expenditures. Our goal was to have a strong free cash flow from operations recovery, driven by improved earnings, which would position us to fund our capital allocation plan and achieve our long-term goals. 
LONG-TERM COMPENSATION TARGETS 
The 2018 net income target was a 10% increase over our 2017 actual results and was driven by the same factors that impacted Corporate EBIT, as described above. The 2018 target for cash flow return on capital reflected the increase in free cash flow from operations described above.

2018 ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PAYOUTS 
For 2018, the performance objectives under our annual incentive plans were as follows: 
Corporate Officers 
Officers of Our Three Operating Units

We believe these weightings hold our operating unit executives most accountable for financial results in the areas where they have the most control and influence, but also motivate them to work cooperatively with other operating units to maximize results for the entire Company. 
The Compensation Committee used Corporate EBIT and Operating Unit EBIT to measure our results of operations and free cash flow from operations to measure our ability to generate cash, which enables us to provide funding for dividends and share repurchases, debt repayments and restructuring actions. The Compensation Committee also emphasized the balance between profitability and cash generation by equally weighting EBIT and free cash flow from operations.

"EBIT," as defined in our annual incentive plans, means the Company's net sales, less cost of goods sold and selling, administrative and general expense, excluding the effects of restructuring charges, accelerated depreciation, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, other unusual or non-recurring items, and the cumulative effect of tax or accounting changes. "Free cash flow from operations," as defined in our annual incentive plans, means cash flow from operating activities before pension contributions and direct payments and rationalization payments, less capital expenditures. In 2018, EBIT and free cash flow from operations were adjusted to reflect the impact of the TireHub transaction, a national transportation strike in Brazil, and payments relating to the refinancing of debt. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee established the following operating drivers that were consistent with our annual operating plan and are tied to the achievement of important strategic objectives that drive the success of our business:

In 2018, the Committee also approved a volume multiplier that, together with the 17-inch and above consumer tire volume operating driver, were intended to drive behavioral change by reinforcing the importance of increasing profitable volume to our strategy. The volume multiplier was designed to enhance the payouts under the annual incentive plan by applying a multiplier of between 1.0x and 1.3x to the calculated payouts of the performance objectives described above (up to a maximum payout of 200%) if certain volume growth targets were also achieved. The Committee also believed that the volume multiplier would help to motivate and retain key employees during a difficult industry cycle. 
Overall Company performance is relevant for determining the annual incentive payments for all named executive officers. Additionally, EMEA's performance is relevant for determining the annual incentive payment for Mr. Delaney and Americas' performance is relevant for determining the annual incentive payment for Mr. McClellan. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed actual results for 2018 with respect to achievement of the company-wide and operating unit performance objectives. The table below shows the performance objectives, actual results for 2018 and corresponding payout percentages under our annual incentive plans.

Since the EBIT and free cash flow from operations performance was largely consistent with our operating driver performance, the Committee determined that the operating driver performance should mirror the calculated performance using the financial performance measures for the overall company and each operating unit. In reaching these decisions, the Committee considered whether the performance under the financial performance measures and the operating drivers were appropriately aligned, and concluded that they were. 
The Committee also reviewed EMEA's volume growth of 1.3% against its volume growth targets, which resulted in a volume multiplier of 1.16x on EMEA's overall performance described above. EMEA's total payout under our annual incentive plan was 20% of target. 
The Compensation Committee reviewed its assessment of the CEO's performance and the CEO's assessment of each of the other named executive officer's performance during 2018, and their respective contributions to our results. In particular, the Compensation Committee considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sales of 17-inch and above consumer replacement tires that outperformed the industry, but fell short of our targets.

• The successful launch of TireHub, our new national distributor in the U.S.

The CEO and the Compensation Committee also considered the contributions of the other named executive officers in furthering the Company's strategic initiatives described in the preceding bullet points. 
The Compensation Committee then established an aggregate incentive pool for all officers, and determined the payout for each officer. In this process, the officer's target incentive amount is first multiplied by the same percentage used to determine the

 applicable portion of the aggregate incentive pool. (For example, if the portion of the aggregate incentive pool applicable to such officer, e.g., overall company, is funded at 150% of the aggregate target incentive amount, the officer's individual payout initially would be set at 150% of his individual incentive target.) Then, the CEO assesses the officer's individual performance and contributions towards Company goals and makes his recommendations with respect to individual payout amounts to the Compensation Committee, which considers the CEO's recommendations and determines the final payouts. The Compensation Committee undertakes the same process for the CEO and makes the determination as to the final payout amount for the CEO. Officers can earn between 0% and 200% of their target incentive, but the total payout for all officers may not exceed the aggregate incentive pool.

The performance criteria for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance periods for the 2018-2020 performance cycle are, consistent with our strategic plan, based 50% on net income and 50% on cash flow return on capital, providing a balanced emphasis on profitability and capital efficiency. Results will be based on our consolidated performance, with no award tied to business unit performance. In this manner, the plan balances performance measures used under our annual incentive plans and reinforces the need for teamwork among executives. Net income is used as a measure to focus on improvement in profitability. Cash flow return on capital is an efficiency metric that measures how much return is generated in proportion to the investment in the business in terms of plant, property and equipment and working capital. 
The TSR modifier measures the relative performance of our Common Stock versus the S&P 500 over the three-year performance cycle of our long-term incentive awards, and is calculated based on the trailing two-month average closing price for our Common Stock and the S&P 500 (as in existence at the end of the period), assuming the reinvestment of dividends. The TSR modifier will cause the payout of our long-term incentive awards to increase or decrease up to 20% (up to a maximum payout of 200%) as follows:

 operations of (1) redemption premiums and other refinancing costs related to the redemption of debt, (2) the TireHub transaction, and (3) a national transportation strike in Brazil. 
In 2018, we faced a number of challenges, which are discussed in detail above in the "Executive Summary" to this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. We did not meet our net income or cash flow return on capital targets for the 2018 performance period primarily due to Corporate EBIT that fell short of our annual operating plan. 
Based on the results during the 2018 performance period, the Compensation Committee did not approve any earnings on the long-term incentive awards for that period for the 2016-2018, 2017-2019 or 2018-2020 awards. 
The table below shows amounts earned by each of the named executive officers in respect of their long-term incentive grants for the 2018 performance period with respect to their 2016-2018 awards, which represents one-third of the three-year target award opportunity:

2018 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANTS 
In 2018, we replaced stock options with restricted stock units as part of our long-term incentive compensation program. The Compensation Committee believes that restricted stock units link executives to the results earned by shareholders, build executive stock ownership, and better attract, incent and retain executive talent. 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 30% of total long-term compensation in the form of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units granted in 2018 have the following terms: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock units vest and convert into shares of Common Stock three years from the grant date; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock units accrue dividend equivalents that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying  restricted stock units.  
[END TABLE]
The portion of long-term compensation provided in the form of restricted stock units grants each year is determined based on the availability of Common Stock under our equity compensation plans, as well as market data on long-term compensation. 
The table below shows the aggregate grant date fair value and the number of restricted stock units granted to each of our named executive officers in 2018.

TIREHUB INCENTIVE PLAN 
In June 2018, the Compensation Committee established an incentive plan for Mr. McClellan and certain other key non-officer employees related to the launch of TireHub. Payments under the TireHub incentive plan are based on performance against the following performance objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Launching TireHub on or before August 31, 2018 (payable at either 0% or 100% of target),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Successfully managing the potential loss of volume due to the transition of business to TireHub during 2018 (payable from  0% to 150% of target),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving net segment operating income improvements due to the TireHub transaction in 2019 (payable from 0% to 150% of  target), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving certain other operational objectives for TireHub by December 31, 2019 (payable at either 0% or 100% of  target).  
[END TABLE]
Mr. McClellan's total target TireHub incentive award is $600,000 and his total maximum incentive award is $800,000. The Compensation Committee considered our performance against the performance objectives for 2018 and found that (1) TireHub was successfully launched on July 1, 2018, resulting in a payout at 100% of target for that performance objective and (2) we successfully managed the transition of tire unit volumes from our former U.S. national tire distributor to TireHub during 2018, resulting in a payout at 150% of target for that performance objective. As a result, Mr. McClellan received total payments of $425,000 under the TireHub incentive plan in 2018. 
Retirement and Other Benefits 
RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
We provide our named executive officers with retirement benefits under both tax-qualified and non-qualified retirement plans. Tax-qualified plan benefits are pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan, the Goodyear Salaried Pension Plan (the "Salaried Plan"), which was frozen effective December 31, 2008, and a defined contribution plan, the Goodyear Employee Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (the "Savings Plan"). Non-qualified plan benefits are pursuant to a defined benefit plan, the Goodyear Supplementary Pension Plan (the "Supplementary Plan"). We also maintain a non-qualified defined benefit Excess Benefit Plan, which was also frozen effective December 31, 2008, that pays an additional pension benefit over that paid from the Salaried Plan if a participant does not meet the eligibility requirements of the Supplementary Plan. 
For all employees who do not meet the eligibility requirements of the Supplementary Plan, there is also a corresponding non-qualified defined contribution Excess Benefit Plan that mirrors the retirement contributions feature of the Savings Plan. 
Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson are currently eligible to receive a benefit under the Supplementary Plan. Upon an involuntary termination within two years of a change in control under the Executive Severance Plan described below, Mr. Bialosky will become vested in his Supplementary Plan benefits. Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson will receive benefits from the frozen Salaried Plan. 
Mr. Wells, Mr. Delaney and Mr. Bialosky are not eligible to participate in the Salaried Plan or the defined benefit Excess Benefit Plan. Participants in the Savings Plan, including all of the named executive officers, are currently eligible to receive Company matching contributions and retirement contributions.

[END TABLE]
The Supplementary Plan provides additional pension benefits to officers and certain other key individuals identified by the Compensation Committee. All of the named executive officers participate in the Supplementary Plan. The Committee believes supplemental executive retirement plans such as the Supplementary Plan are an important part of executive compensation and are utilized by many large companies that compete with the Company for executive talent. Retirement benefits, including those provided through a supplemental executive retirement plan, are essential to attracting, motivating and retaining talented executives with a history of leadership and to providing retirement replacement income. Retirement benefits are an important factor in an executive's decision to accept or reject a new position. The Compensation Committee has adopted a policy prohibiting the grant of additional service credit in the Supplementary Plan for newly hired officers and other key employees. 
The number reported in the "Change in Pension Value" column in the Summary Compensation Table reflects the change in each NEO's pension value in 2018. Changes in pension value are caused largely by two factors: (1) additional pension benefits accrued by the NEOs under the Supplementary Plan when they receive higher compensation due to roles of increasing responsibility or through strong performance, and (2) changes in assumptions used for financial reporting purposes, such as changes in discount rates and updated actuarial assumptions regarding life expectancies. Mr. Kramer's pension value decreased in 2018 due to increases in both the discount rate used to calculate the pension value and the interest rate used to determine the lump sum value of the Supplementary Plan benefit, partially offset by an increase in accrued benefits due to the growth in pension value from the passage of time and an additional year of credited service. 
For more information regarding the terms of these plans and the named executive officers' accrued benefits under these plans, see "Defined Contribution Plan Benefits" at page 58 and "Pension Benefits" at page 58. 
SEVERANCE AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL BENEFITS 
Our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan") provides for the payment of severance benefits to our officers, including all of the named executive officers, if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances during certain periods before or within two years following a change-in-control of the Company. The Executive Severance Plan does not provide for any excise tax gross-ups or walk-away rights. 
The Executive Severance Plan is designed to attract, retain and motivate officers, provide for stability and continuity in the event of an actual or threatened change-in-control, and ensure that our officers are able to devote their full time and attention to the Company's operations in the event of an actual or threatened change-in-control. 
The Executive Severance Plan and the related change-in-control triggers (commonly referred to as "double triggers") generally provide for the payment of severance benefits if employment is terminated under certain circumstances during certain periods before or within two years following a change-in-control of the Company. The change-in-control triggers in our equity compensation plans are substantially similar to those in the Executive Severance Plan. We selected the specific change-in-control triggers used in the Executive Severance Plan and our equity compensation plans, such as the acquisition of 20% or more of Goodyear's Common Stock, a significant change in the composition of the Board of Directors or the acquisition of actual control of Goodyear, based upon our review of market practices, including provisions included in similar agreements of other public companies. Based upon that review, we determined that the terms and conditions of the Executive Severance Plan, including the specific change-in-control triggers, were consistent with market practices.

The Executive Severance Plan also provides severance benefits to our officers, including each of the named executive officers, if their employment is terminated by us other than for Cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), death or disability, and other than in connection with a change-in-control. 
To be eligible to receive benefits under the Executive Severance Plan, an officer must execute a release and agree, among other things, to certain confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-solicitation and non-competition covenants. 
The Compensation Committee believes that our severance benefits are in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, are a necessary component of a competitive compensation program, and are in line with severance benefits in place at other companies. 
For additional information regarding the terms of the Executive Severance Plan and benefits payable under that plan, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control" at page 62. 
PERQUISITES 
We provide certain executive officers, including our named executive officers, with limited personal benefits and perquisites, as described below and in footnote 5 to the Summary Compensation Table at page 53. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and approved the perquisites described below. The Compensation Committee recognizes that these perquisites are an important factor in protecting our executive officers and in enabling them to focus on our business with minimal disruption. We do not provide any tax reimbursements to our executive officers for any of the perquisites we provide them. 
Home Security Systems. We pay for the cost of home security systems for a limited number of executive officers in order to enhance their safety and protect our investment in them. We cover the cost of installation, monitoring and maintenance for these systems. 
Use of Company Aircraft. In limited circumstances, executive officers are permitted to use our company aircraft for personal travel. 
Tire Program. We offer our executive officers and Board members the opportunity to receive up to two sets of tires per year at our expense, including the cost of tires, mounting, balancing and disposal fees. 
Financial Planning and Tax Preparation Services. We offer financial assistance to our executive officers to help them cover the cost of financial planning and tax preparation services. In providing this benefit, we seek to alleviate our executives' concern regarding personal financial planning so that they may devote their full attention to our business. The maximum annual cost to the Company under this program is $9,000 per officer. 
Club Memberships. We pay the annual dues for a corporate club membership that is available to Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson. None of the other named executive officers utilize this corporate club membership. The membership is intended to be used primarily for business purposes, although members may use the club for personal purposes so long as they pay all incremental costs, other than the annual dues, related to that personal use.

Annual Physical Exams. We strongly encourage our executive officers to have an annual comprehensive physical examination which we pay for in order to enhance their physical well-being and protect our investment in them. 
EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN 
The Goodyear Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides named executive officers and other highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer various forms of compensation. For participants, this offers an additional means to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. There is no guaranteed return associated with any deferred amounts. During 2018, none of the named executive officers made deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
For additional information regarding the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and participant balances, see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" at page 61. 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER TRANSITION 
On June 15, 2018, Laura Thompson, then our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, announced her upcoming retirement, effective March 31, 2019. On September 20, 2018, Darren Wells became Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Ms. Thompson in that role. Ms. Thompson will continue to serve as an Executive Vice President of the Company until her retirement. 
Ms. Thompson has worked at Goodyear for 35 years across numerous roles, including previously serving as Vice President, Business Development. In light of her strong relationships with many participants in the tire industry and how important they are to us, we have asked Ms. Thompson to continue overseeing business development activities and to help transition those relationships to others at the Company. To ensure an orderly transition of her many responsibilities, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with her, pursuant to which Ms. Thompson will provide consulting services to the Company following her retirement. The Consulting Agreement's term will run for fifteen months, from April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, and Ms. Thompson will be paid $250,000 per quarter for her consulting services and will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses and premiums for retiree medical family coverage under the Company's retiree medical plan. 
Compensation Policies and Practices 
STOCKHOLDING GUIDELINES 
To better link the interests of management and our shareholders, the Compensation Committee has established stockholding guidelines for our officers. These guidelines specify a number of shares that our officers are expected to accumulate and hold based on a multiple of annual base salary of six times for the CEO, three times for Executive Vice Presidents, Presidents of our operating units and Senior Vice Presidents, and two times for elected Vice Presidents. Therefore, the stockholding requirement for Mr. Kramer is six times his annual base salary and for Mr. Wells, Mr. McClellan, Mr. Delaney and Mr. Bialosky is three times their annual base salary. All shares of Common Stock owned outright by officers (or their spouses) and held by them in the Goodyear stock fund of the Savings Plan, and 60% of the shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units, earned (but unvested) performance shares awarded to officers and share equivalent units held in our deferred compensation plan, are counted as ownership in assessing compliance with the guidelines. Unearned performance shares and unexercised stock options are not counted toward compliance with the guidelines. The stock price used in assessing compliance with the guidelines as of May 1st of each year will be the average closing stock price for the prior 60-day period.

           Compensation Policies and Practices         
[END TABLE]
The stockholding guidelines also include stock retention provisions. If an officer has met their stockholding requirement, they are required to retain 25% of the net shares received from any vested shares of Common Stock or any exercised options for at least one year from the date of vesting or exercise and may only sell or otherwise dispose of shares to the extent they will still meet their stockholding requirement following that sale or disposition. If an officer has not met their stockholding requirement, they are required to retain all of the net shares received from any vested shares of Common Stock or any exercised options, and may not sell or otherwise dispose of shares until they have met their stockholding requirement, unless they demonstrate a need to sell shares due to a financial hardship. Net shares are the shares remaining after payment of the exercise price and/or withholding taxes. 
Mr. Kramer holds shares of Common Stock worth approximately eleven times his annual base salary, well in excess of his minimum stockholding requirement. Mr. McClellan and Mr. Bialosky have also met their stockholding requirement, and Mr. Wells and Mr. Delaney are making progress towards satisfying their stockholding requirement. 
PROHIBITION ON HEDGING AND PLEDGING 
We have adopted, as part of our insider trading policy, prohibitions on the short sale of our Common Stock and other securities and the issuance, purchase or sale of, or trading or dealing in, puts, calls or other options or rights relating to our Common Stock and other securities. These provisions prohibit our directors, officers and employees from hedging the risk of their ownership of our Common Stock. We also prohibit our directors, officers and employees from holding our Common Stock and other securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging them as collateral for a loan. 
RECOVERY OF COMPENSATION (CLAWBACK POLICY) 
If the Compensation Committee determines that an officer has engaged in conduct detrimental to the Company, the Compensation Committee may take a range of actions to remedy this conduct, prevent its recurrence and impose appropriate discipline. Discipline would vary depending on the facts and circumstances, and may include (1) termination of employment, (2) cancelling or reducing any outstanding compensatory grants or awards, (3) initiating an action for breach of fiduciary duty or fraud which could include recovery of any unjustly obtained incentive compensation, and (4) requiring reimbursement of compensation or other payments in accordance with provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our claw-back policy described below or the terms of the relevant compensation plan. These remedies would be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any actions imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities. 
Beginning with awards made in 2012, the Compensation Committee adopted a claw-back policy that effectively contractually extends the claw-back provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the Presidents of each of our strategic business units and all of our Senior Vice Presidents. If we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement as a result of misconduct, the claw-back policy would permit the Compensation Committee to require reimbursement of (1) any incentive compensation received from us during the one-year period following the publication of misstated financial statements and (2) any profits realized from the sale of our securities during that one-year period. We will make any necessary revisions to our claw-back policy once implementing rules pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 are adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The Nasdaq Stock Market.

[END TABLE]
In addition, under our equity compensation plans, the Compensation Committee may require a plan participant who engages in competition with us within 18 months after their termination of employment to return or forfeit the realized value of all awards under those plans during such period of time that the Compensation Committee determines. Our Executive Severance Plan also provides for the recovery or forfeiture of severance payments if a person receiving payments pursuant to the plan violates certain confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-solicitation and non-competition covenants.

4  Represents total change in pension value for each named executive officer, which reflects both the accrual of additional  benefits and changes in the assumptions used to value the benefits. The discount rate used to calculate the Supplementary Plan pension value increased from 3.68% at December 31, 2017 to 4.04% at December 31, 2018. Also, the interest rate  used to determine the lump sum value of the Supplementary Plan benefit increased from 1.00% to 1.75%. These changes in assumptions accounted for a portion of the total change in pension value for each of the named executive officers. The table below  allocates the total change in pension value between the actual increase in accrued benefits, including the growth in pension value due to the passage of time, and assumption changes.

Summary of Realized Pay Earned by Our Chief Executive Officer for 2016, 2017 and 2018 
Our compensation programs for Mr. Kramer and our other officers are primarily based on performance. The information shown below is intended to supplement and not be a substitute for the information in the Summary Compensation Table. The Summary Compensation Table includes several items that are driven by accounting and actuarial assumptions, which are not necessarily reflective of compensation actually realized by Mr. Kramer in a particular year. For example, the information required to be in the Summary Compensation Table combines pay actually received (base salary and annual cash incentive payments) with the accounting value of equity compensation granted, which may never be realized, and earned but unvested long term cash awards, which continue to be subject to forfeiture and a TSR modifier until the vesting date. The Summary Compensation Table is also required to include other compensation (contributions to qualified defined contribution plans and perquisites) and the change in pension values (based on actuarial assumptions), much of which is not realized in the periods presented. 
The following table reports base salary, annual incentive earned, long term incentive to be paid out for the three-year performance cycle ending in each respective year and pre-tax compensation earned upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of stock awards regardless of when they were granted.

During the restriction period for shares of restricted stock, the recipient is not entitled to delivery of the shares, restrictions are placed on the transferability of the shares, and all or a portion of the shares will be forfeited if the recipient terminates employment for reasons other than as approved by the Compensation Committee. Upon expiration of the restriction period, the appropriate number of shares of Common Stock will be delivered to the grantee free of all restrictions. During the restriction period for shares of restricted stock, the grantee shall be entitled to vote restricted shares and receive dividends. For grants made after April 2013, shares of restricted stock will be credited with notional dividends that vest and are payable in cash (without interest) at the same time and subject to the same conditions as the underlying shares of restricted stock. Restricted stock units do not have any voting rights but receive dividend equivalents that vest and are payable in shares of Common Stock at the same time and subject to the same conditions as the underlying restricted stock units. Earned and unearned, but unvested, performance share units do not have any voting rights and are not entitled to receive dividend equivalents.

 qualified plan limit under the Code, which was $230,000 for 2008. A portion of the benefit may be paid by employee contributions. Effective December 31, 2007, all active participants in the Salaried Plan became vested and are entitled to a benefit upon any termination of employment. Benefits are available on a five-year certain and continuous annuity basis at age 65, by converting the lump sum to an annuity. Annuity benefits payable to a participant who retires prior to age 65 are subject to a reduction for each month retirement precedes age 65. Benefits under the Salaried Plan are funded by an irrevocable tax-exempt trust. 
Participation in the Salaried Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2004. Subsequent hires, including Mr. Wells, Mr. Delaney and Mr. Bialosky, participate in the retirement contributions feature of the Savings Plan. Under the Savings Plan, each participant receives an allocation each pay period equal to a percentage of compensation, with compensation held to the qualified plan limit under the Code. Effective January 1, 2009, Salaried Plan participants, including Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson, also began receiving allocations under the retirement contributions feature of the Savings Plan. 
Goodyear also maintains the Supplementary Plan, a non-qualified plan which provides additional retirement benefits to our officers and certain other key employees, including all of the named executive officers. The Supplementary Plan provides pension benefits to participants who retire with at least 30 years of service, retire after age 55 with at least ten years of service or retire after age 65 with at least five years of service. The formula for an annuity benefit is based on a percentage determined using credited service (22% with 10 years, 38% with 20 years, 48% with 30 years and 54% with 40 years) times five-year average compensation above the breakpoint ($64,200 in 2018), with compensation inclusive of base salary and annual incentive payments. The five-year average compensation uses the highest five calendar years, not necessarily consecutive, out of the last ten years. Benefits are offset for the Salaried Plan, the retirement contributions feature of the Savings Plan, applicable non-U.S. benefits and certain prior employer benefits. Under the Supplementary Plan, benefits payable to a participant who retires prior to age 62 are subject to a reduction of 0.4% for each month retirement precedes age 62. All benefits from the Supplementary Plan will be paid in a lump sum. For participants considered to be among the top 50 wage earners of the Company, benefits cannot be distributed prior to six months after separation of service. Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson are vested in their Supplementary Plan benefits. 
Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson are eligible for immediate commencement of the benefit from the Salaried Plan as of December 31, 2018. Mr. Wells, Mr. Delaney and Mr. Bialosky are not participants in the Salaried Plan. The chart below indicates the date at which each named executive officer is or will be eligible to receive a benefit from the Supplementary Plan.

We also maintain a non-qualified defined benefit Excess Benefit Plan that pays an additional pension benefit over that paid from the Salaried Plan if a participant does not meet the eligibility requirements of the Supplementary Plan. For employees hired after December 31, 2004, and for all employees as of December 31, 2008, who do not meet the eligibility requirements of the Supplementary Plan, there is a corresponding defined contribution Excess Benefit Plan that mirrors the retirement contributions feature of the Savings Plan. Like the qualified plans, effective December 31, 2008 accruals were frozen under the defined benefit Excess Benefit Plan and all affected participants began receiving defined contribution allocations under the defined contribution Excess Benefit Plan. 
The Pension Benefits table below shows for the named executive officers the number of years of credited service, present value of accumulated benefit and payments during the last fiscal year, for each defined benefit plan. 
The "Present Value of Accumulated Benefit" is the lump sum value as of December 31, 2018 of the expected pension benefit payable at age 62 that was earned as of December 31, 2018. That is, the benefit reflects service and compensation only through 2018, not projected for future years. The benefit payment at age 62 is assumed to be the lump sum form. The present value is measured using the same assumptions used for financial reporting purposes (and which are set forth following the Pension Benefits Table), with the exception of the commencement age. The commencement age is assumed to be 62 because that is the age at which the Supplementary Plan benefit is payable with no reduction for early retirement. If a participant would not have 10 years of service at age 62, then the benefit is assumed to be payable at the age when 10 years of service would be attained. 
Generally, a participant's years of credited service under the Supplementary Plan are based on years of employment with Goodyear. However, in the past, credit for service prior to employment with Goodyear was infrequently granted. Mr. Kramer received 13.6 additional years of credited service following his hiring by Goodyear in respect of service with a prior employer. The benefits paid to Mr. Kramer under the Supplementary Plan will be reduced by amounts he is entitled to receive under the pension plan maintained by his prior employer. Due to this service grant, the present value of accumulated benefit in the Pension Benefits table is $5,281,472 higher for Mr. Kramer. None of the other named executive officers have received any additional years of credited service. 
The Compensation Committee has adopted a policy prohibiting the grant of additional service credit in the Supplementary Plan for newly hired officers and other key employees.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
The Goodyear Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that provides named executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees the opportunity to defer their base salary and annual incentive payments. Deferred amounts may be invested in one of five investment alternatives or, with respect to annual incentive payments, Goodyear stock units. Three of these investment alternatives are funds managed by The Northern Trust Company, and currently include a money market fund, an equity index fund and a balanced fund. The average interest rate payable with respect to funds invested in the Northern Trust money market fund was 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The fourth investment vehicle is a growth fund managed by American Century Investments and the fifth investment vehicle is a bond fund managed by Western Asset Management. Investment elections among the five investment alternatives may be changed daily. Deferrals of annual incentive payments into Goodyear stock units will result in a 20% premium paid in stock units that will vest in one year. There is no guaranteed return associated with any deferred amounts, and deferred amounts are subject to the claims of creditors in the event of our bankruptcy. Distribution of deferred amounts may begin after separation of service or in a selected number of years ranging from one to 20. Payment of deferred amounts will be in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments, as elected at the time of deferral. Redeferral of amounts originally deferred prior to January 1, 2005 is allowed only if elected one year prior to the scheduled payout. Any stock units are converted to shares of Common Stock and distributed to the participant in January of the fourth year following the end of the plan year under which the award was earned.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
We provide for the payment of severance and certain other benefits to our named executive officers upon certain types of terminations of employment, as described below. 
EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN 
The Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits to the Company's officers, including all of the named executive officers, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  If a participant's employment is terminated by the Company and its affiliates other than for Cause (as such term is  defined below), death or disability (and other than in connection with a change-in-control, as described in paragraph (2) below), such participant will generally  receive: (i) earned but unpaid base salary and annual incentive compensation and accrued paid vacation, sick leave, sabbatical, holiday and other paid time off; (ii) a pro-rated annual incentive  payment based on actual performance for the entire fiscal year in an amount not to exceed the participant's target annual incentive; (iii) a cash severance payment equal to the sum of the participant's base salary and target annual  incentive at the time of severance multiplied by the participant's severance multiple, which is established by the Compensation Committee and currently ranges from 1.0x to 2.0x; (iv) if the sum of the participant's age plus years of  credited service is equal to or greater than 75, vesting of the participant's benefit under the Supplementary Plan; (v) continued health care coverage for a number of years equal to the participant's severance multiple; and  (vi) outplacement services in an amount not to exceed $25,000. Mr. Kramer's severance multiple is 2.0x and each of the other named executive officers' severance multiple is 1.5x.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  If a participant's employment is terminated involuntarily other than for Cause, death, disability or mandatory  retirement or by the participant for Good Reason during the pendency of, and for ninety days following the cessation of, a Potential Change in Control (as such term is defined below) or within two years following a Change in Control (as such term is  defined below), such participant will generally receive: (i) earned but unpaid base salary and annual incentive

To be eligible to receive the benefits described above, the participant must execute a release and agree, among other things, to certain confidentiality, non-disparagement, non-solicitation and non-competition covenants. 
The Executive Severance Plan has been effective since February 28, 2013 and now renews for one-year periods unless the Company provides notice, at least 90 days prior to the end of the current term, of its intent not to renew the Executive Severance Plan. The Executive Severance Plan automatically renewed for an additional one-year period ending on February 28, 2020. 
As used in the Executive Severance Plan: 
"Cause" means (1) the continued failure by an eligible employee to substantially perform the employee's duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from the employee's incapacity due to physical or mental illness), (2) the engaging by the employee in conduct which is demonstrably injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise, (3) the employee committing any felony or any crime involving fraud, breach of trust or misappropriation or (4) any breach or violation of any agreement relating to the employee's employment with the Company where the Company, in its discretion, determines that such breach or violation materially and adversely affects the Company.

The description above is meant only to be a summary of the provisions of the Executive Severance Plan. The Executive Severance Plan was an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2013. 
QUANTIFICATION OF TERMINATION BENEFITS 
The table below shows amounts that would be payable to each of the named executive officers, as of December 31, 2018, upon the termination of their employment in the circumstances indicated in each row of the table. The amounts shown are calculated on the assumption that the triggering event occurred on December 31, 2018. We have assumed that, if a named executive officer resigned or was terminated for Cause, the Compensation Committee would have exercised its discretion to cancel any outstanding awards in respect of the performance cycles ending on December 31, 2018 prior to the payment of those awards in February 2019. Other assumptions used to determine the amounts shown are described below. 
Cash Severance. The amounts shown in the rows captioned "Termination Without Cause" and "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control" are calculated in accordance with the terms of the Executive Severance Plan. (See "Executive Severance Plan" above.) Cash severance is not payable in any other circumstance. 
Annual and Long-Term Cash Incentives. The amounts shown in the table for annual and long-term cash incentives are the amounts earned for the annual or three-year performance cycles ended December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the rows captioned "Death/Disability" and "Retirement" also include the amounts earned but not yet payable for completed performance periods under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 long-term cash incentive awards. The amounts shown in the row captioned

           Potential Payments Upon Termination or  Change-in-Control         
[END TABLE]
 "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control" also include (a) the amounts earned but not yet payable for completed performance periods and (b) the unearned amounts at the target amount of the award opportunity for uncompleted performance periods under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 long-term cash incentive awards. 
Equity. The amounts shown in the table for equity with respect to restricted stock units in the rows captioned "Death/Disability" and "Retirement" reflect pro-rata vesting, and in the row captioned "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control" reflect the full vesting, of the restricted stock units upon the occurrence of those events. In each case, the amounts shown are calculated based on a per share price of $20.41, the closing market price of our Common Stock on December 31, 2018. 
The amounts shown in the table for equity with respect to performance share awards are the amounts earned for the three-year performance cycle ended December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the rows captioned "Death/Disability" and "Retirement" also include the amounts earned but not yet payable for completed performance periods under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance share awards. The amounts shown in the row captioned "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control" also include (a) the amounts earned but not yet payable for completed performance periods and (b) the unearned amounts at the target amount of the award opportunity for uncompleted performance periods under the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance share awards. In each case, the amounts shown are calculated based on a per share price of $20.41, the closing market price of our Common Stock on December 31, 2018. 
Our equity compensation plans provide that unexercised stock options terminate automatically if the optionee ceases to be an employee of Goodyear or one of its subsidiaries for any reason, except that (a) upon retirement or disability of the optionee more than six months after the grant date, each stock option will become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until the earlier of five years or its expiration date, (b) in the event of the death of the optionee more than six months after the grant date, each stock option will become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until the earlier of three years after the date of death of the optionee or its expiration date, and (c) for options granted on or after June 8, 2010, in the event of the termination of the optionee's employment by us other than for cause, each vested stock option will remain exercisable for 90 days following the date of termination of their employment. For these purposes, resignations, terminations without cause, and involuntary terminations upon a change in control are treated like a retirement if the employee is eligible for retirement as of the date of termination. Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson were eligible for retirement on December 31, 2018. 
Additional Retirement Benefits. The table below shows the additional retirement benefits, if any, that would be payable to the named executive officer if the named executive officer's employment was terminated on December 31, 2018, and that named executive officer was vested in the benefit as of that date. Mr. Kramer, Mr. McClellan and Ms. Thompson are vested in their Supplementary Plan benefit. Mr. Wells, Mr. Delaney and Mr. Bialosky are not yet vested in a Supplementary Plan benefit, are not eligible to participate in the Salaried Plan or the defined benefit Excess Benefit Plan, and would instead receive substantially smaller benefits from the defined contribution Excess Benefit Plan. The Supplementary Plan and Salaried Plan amounts shown in the Pension Benefits table are the present values at December 31, 2018 of benefits that would be payable in lump sum form at the later of age 62 and the age at which 10 years of service is attained (or age at December 31, 2018, if older than 62). The amounts shown in the table below are the additional amounts that would be payable, together with the amounts shown in the Pension Benefits table, in lump sum form after termination of employment at December 31, 2018. The additional amounts are solely due to differences in the assumptions used to value the benefit as of December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
In the event of an "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control," Mr. Bialosky's benefits under the Supplementary Plan will become vested since he has five years of credited service. For Mr. Bialosky, the difference between the amount payable from the Supplementary Plan upon a triggering event ($3,537,530) and the value presented in the Pension Benefits table ($3,359,051) is solely due to differences in the assumptions used in the calculations. 
All Other Benefits. The amounts shown for all other benefits for each scenario include the payment of accrued vacation. In addition, the amounts shown in the row captioned "Termination Without Cause" include reimbursement of COBRA payments and payments for outplacement services (capped at $25,000), and the amounts shown in the row captioned "Involuntary Termination Within Two Years of Change in Control" include reimbursement of COBRA payments, payments for outplacement services (capped at $25,000), and reimbursement for legal fees, if any (assumed to be $0 for purposes of the table below).

Goodyear directors who are not officers or employees of Goodyear or any of its subsidiaries receive, as compensation for their services as a director, a combination of cash retainer and stock awards pursuant to the Outside Directors' Equity Participation Plan (the "Directors' Equity Plan").

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews pay levels for non-employee directors each year with assistance from F.W. Cook, who prepares a comprehensive assessment of Goodyear's non-employee director compensation program. That assessment includes benchmarking of director compensation against the same peer group used for executive compensation purposes, an update on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance best practices. Following that review, the Board of Directors, consistent with the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, did not make any changes to the outside directors' compensation in 2018. The outside directors' annual cash compensation was $130,000 and the grant date fair value of annual stock awards was $145,000 during 2018. The Lead Director received an additional $55,000. The chairpersons of the Audit and Compensation Committees received an additional $20,000, and the chairpersons of all other committees received an additional $15,000. Any director who attended more than 24 Board and committee meetings received $1,700 for each additional meeting attended ($1,000 if the meeting was attended by telephone). In addition, the Board may form special committees from time to time and determine the compensation of the chairperson of such committees. Travel and lodging expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings are paid by Goodyear. Mr. Kramer did not receive additional compensation for his service as a director. 
Outside directors also participate in the Directors' Equity Plan, which is intended to further align the interests of directors with the interests of shareholders by making part of each director's compensation dependent on the value and appreciation over time of our Common Stock. For 2018, each eligible director received a quarterly grant of restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of $36,250, payable on the first business day of the subsequent calendar quarter based on the closing market price of our Common Stock on that date. These restricted stock units will be paid to directors in shares of Common Stock on the fifth business day of the quarter following the quarter during which the director leaves the Board. The Directors' Equity Plan also permits each participant annually to elect to have 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of his or her cash retainer and meeting fees deferred and converted into share equivalent units based on the closing market price of our Common Stock on the payment date. Under the Directors' Equity Plan, the restricted stock units and share equivalent units receive dividend equivalents at the same rate as our Common Stock, which dividends will be converted into restricted stock units or share equivalent units, as the case may be, based on the closing market price of our Common Stock on the dividend payment date. Share equivalent units accrued prior to October 1, 2010 will be converted to a dollar value at the closing market price of our Common Stock on the later of the first business day of the seventh month following the month during which the participant ceased to be a director and the fifth business day of the year next following the year during which the participant ceased to be a director. Such amounts earned and vested prior to January 1, 2005, will be paid in ten annual installments or, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, in a lump sum or in fewer than ten installments beginning on the fifth business day following the conversion from share equivalent units to a dollar value. Amounts in Directors' Equity Plan accounts that are to be paid in installments will earn interest from the date converted to a dollar value until paid at a rate one percent higher than the prevailing yield on United States Treasury securities having a ten-year maturity on the conversion date. Amounts earned and vested on or after January 1, 2005, will be paid out in a lump sum on the fifth business day following the conversion from share equivalent units to a dollar value. Share equivalent units accrued on or after October 1, 2010 will be paid to directors in shares of Common Stock on the fifth business day of the quarter following the quarter during which the director leaves the Board. 
The stockholding guidelines for directors specify that a director must accumulate and hold a number of shares equal in value to five times the annual cash retainer. Shares owned directly and restricted stock units and share equivalent units accrued to a Directors' Equity Plan account are counted as ownership in assessing compliance with the guidelines. The stock price to be

Risks Related To Compensation Policies And Practices 
We have reviewed our compensation policies and practices for our employees and have concluded that the risks arising from those policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
Pay Ratio 
For 2018, the annual total compensation of the CEO, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, was $6,213,100, and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees, other than the CEO, was $45,459, resulting in a ratio of 137:1 (the "pay ratio"). 
In determining the median employee, we collected information regarding taxable wages for all employees, defined consistently with applicable SEC regulations, of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of October 1, 2017 for the period beginning January 1, 2017 and ending September 30, 2017. Taxable wages generally included an employee's actual income, including wages, overtime, bonuses and other cash incentives, that are subject to taxation in the applicable jurisdiction. We converted earnings paid in local currencies to U.S. dollars by applying the average exchange rate used for the preparation of our financial statements for the period from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017. 
For 2018, we used the same median employee that was identified in 2017 since there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. 
We did not utilize the "de minimis" exception, statistical sampling or other similar methods, or any cost-of-living adjustment, as permitted by applicable SEC regulations, in calculating the pay ratio.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and officers to file reports of holdings and transactions in our equity securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a practical matter, we assist our directors and officers by completing and filing these reports electronically on their behalf. We believe that our directors and officers timely complied with all such filing requirements during 2018, except that an amended Form 3 was filed on May 18, 2018 to amend a Form 3 dated September 18, 2017 for Ryan Patterson, President, Asia Pacific, in order to report the direct ownership of 1,690 shares of Common Stock that were inadvertently omitted from the original Form 3 filing. 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
During 2018, Goodyear and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of their business and at competitive prices and terms, made sales to or purchases from, or engaged in other transactions with, corporations of which certain Goodyear non-management directors are directors and/or executive officers. Goodyear does not consider the transactions to be material to its business and believes such transactions were not material in relation to the business of such other corporations or the interests of the directors concerned. 
On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to complete a Director and Officer Questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transactions with the Company in which the director or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, have a direct or indirect material interest. Under the "Board of Directors and Executive Officers Conflict of Interest Policy," directors and executive officers are expected to promptly disclose potential conflicts of interest to Goodyear's General Counsel, who may consult with the Chairman of the Governance Committee on matters of interpretation of the policy. Any waivers of the policy are required to be approved by the Board of Directors, and any such waivers will be promptly disclosed to shareholders.

The Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policy provides for pre-approval of audit, audit-related, tax and all other fees on an annual basis and, in addition, individual engagements anticipated to exceed pre-established thresholds must be separately approved. Under the policy, the Audit Committee delegates pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Committee. The Chairman is to report any such pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Management has the primary responsibility for the integrity of Goodyear's financial information and the financial reporting process, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), Goodyear's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for conducting independent audits of Goodyear's financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and expressing an opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based upon those audits. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities by management and PwC. 
As part of its oversight responsibility, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements, the adequacy of financial controls and the effectiveness of Goodyear's internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. The Audit Committee also has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed under PCAOB standards. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PwC their independence from Goodyear. 
Based on the review and discussions with management and PwC referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that Goodyear include the audited consolidated financial statements of Goodyear and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2018 in Goodyear's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and in its 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders.

PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board has the ultimate authority and responsibility to directly appoint, retain, compensate, oversee, evaluate, and, where appropriate, terminate the independent accountants. The Audit Committee has appointed PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit Goodyear's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. During fiscal year 2018, PwC served as Goodyear's independent registered public accounting firm and also provided audit-related, tax and other services. See "Principal Accountant Fees and Services" above. 
PwC and its predecessor firms have been our independent auditors since 1898. The Audit Committee believes that our long-term engagement of PwC has several benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improved audit quality due to PwC's in-depth understanding of our global  business, accounting policies, practices and systems, and internal controls.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improved audit efficiency and effectiveness due to PwC's familiarity with the Company, which also results in a lower  fee structure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Elimination of time and expense inherent in on-boarding a new independent auditor.   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee engages in an annual evaluation of the independent auditor's qualifications, performance and independence and periodically considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC's policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to us. For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. We select the Company's lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy following meetings between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and candidates for that role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management. 
The members of the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of PwC to serve as Goodyear's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of Goodyear and its shareholders. As a result, the following resolution will be presented by the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019 is hereby ratified."

           PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         
[END TABLE]
Ratification of the appointment of PwC requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock. In the event the appointment of PwC is not ratified by the shareholders, the adverse vote will be deemed to be an indication to the Audit Committee that it should consider selecting another independent registered public accounting firm for 2020. 
  Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal 3).

PROPOSAL 4 – SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL 
The proposal set forth below has been submitted by Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, the beneficial owner of no fewer than 200 shares of Goodyear's Common Stock. 
Proposal 4 – Independent Board Chairman 
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
Caterpillar is an example of a company changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman. 
In the year leading up to the submittal of this proposal our stock fell from $33 to $21. This stock price decline was in spite of an authorized increase of $1 Billion for the share repurchase plan which is supposed to increase the price of the stock. 
Plus stock buybacks are a sign of short-termism for executives — sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the firm. A related issue is that buybacks draw money away from investment. A dollar spent repurchasing a share is a dollar that cannot be spent on new machinery, an acquisition, entry into a new market, or anything else. Adoption of this proposal will cost Goodyear virtually nothing — yet it can improve board oversight of company performance. 
Meanwhile there are new challenges that face our company that need to be well managed and prevented from reoccurring: 
Product Concerns — National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Investigation into Safety Defects in G159 Tires; 95 Injuries Reported 
April 2018 
Workplace Safety Concerns — Multiple Asbestos-Related Lawsuits 
February 2018 
Additionally our Chairman/CEO received the highest 2018 negative votes of any director. 
Please vote yes:

[END TABLE]
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. 
The Board opposes this proposal because, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  The Board has in place strong independent leadership in the form of an independent Lead Director role with  clearly-delineated and comprehensive oversight responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  It would deprive the Board of the flexibility to determine the most effective Board leadership structure at any  particular point in time; and

  (3)  Independent shareholders have substantial shareholder rights flowing from the strong governance practices adopted by the  Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines specifically provide that the independent directors of the Board must elect an independent Lead Director annually. W. Alan McCollough currently serves as our independent Lead Director. The Board believes that Mr. McCollough's skills, experience, commitment and the time he devotes to his role make him well-qualified to serve as our independent Lead Director. 
In 2013, the Board revised the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines to further strengthen the role of our independent Lead Director. Among other duties, the Corporate Governance Guidelines specify that the independent Lead Director shall: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent  directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serve as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approve all information sent to the Board, including meeting agendas, and advise the Chairman on such matters, and may  specifically request the inclusion of information;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approve the schedule of Board meetings to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items and  advise the Chairman on the same;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Call meetings or executive sessions of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Interview, along with the Chairman of the Governance Committee, Board candidates and make recommendations to the Governance  Committee and the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If requested by major shareholders, ensure that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication in  appropriate circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
The designation of an independent Lead Director by the independent directors of the Board demonstrates the Board's continuing commitment to strong corporate governance, Board independence and the important role of the independent Lead Director. 
The independent directors have ample opportunity to, and regularly do, assess the performance of the CEO and provide meaningful direction to him. The Board has strong, independent oversight of management: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 85% of the Company's directors are independent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees are independent directors;

• Committee Chairs, all of whom are independent, approve agendas for their committee meetings;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board and Committee agendas are prepared based on discussions with all directors and recommendations from management, and  all directors are encouraged to request agenda items, additional information and/or modifications to schedules as they deem appropriate; and    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board holds executive sessions of the independent directors at each Board meeting.    
[END TABLE]
Further, the Board of Directors has adopted many leading governance practices that provide accountability to our shareholders: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annually elected directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Majority voting in the election of directors with a resignation policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy access rights; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shareholder right to call special meetings.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that the Company's balanced and flexible corporate governance structure, including an independent Lead Director with clearly-delineated and comprehensive duties, makes it unnecessary and ill-advised to have an absolute requirement that the Chairman be an independent director. The Board believes that adopting such a rule would only limit the Board's ability to select the director it believes is best suited to serve as Chairman of the Board, in light of all the facts and circumstances known to the Board, and is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Goodyear has a strong history of listening and responding to shareholder feedback, as recently demonstrated by our independent Lead Director's engagement with several of our largest shareholders during 2018. In these conversations, many investors expressed support for Goodyear's current Board leadership structure and noted that they were pleased to interact directly with our independent Lead Director. The Board has also considered as part of its recommendation that 74% and 77% of investors voted against this same proposal by the same shareholder when it was presented in 2014 and 2017, respectively. The Board's approach is consistent with that of most large, publicly traded companies in the United States. According to Shearman & Sterling's 2018 Corporate Governance & Executive Compensation Survey of the 100 largest U.S. public companies, only 19% have an independent board chairman. The Board periodically reviews the Board leadership structure and the roles of the Chairman and independent Lead Director, taking into consideration the views expressed by our shareholders. The Board believes it is important, especially in our changing and challenging environment, to retain the flexibility to separate or combine the offices of CEO and Chairman. 
Currently, the Board believes that having Mr. Kramer serve as Chairman best positions the Company to compete successfully and advance shareholder interests. His extensive knowledge of the Company and the tire industry, gained through 19 years of experience in positions of increasing authority including Chief Financial Officer and President, North America, is valuable to the Board in his role as Chairman. 
Mr. Kramer's leadership at the management and Board levels is instrumental to Goodyear's ability to adapt to the evolving competitive landscape. Under his leadership as Chairman and CEO, the Company is focused on capturing value through developing tires for emerging vehicle types, developing technology for future transportation solutions (e.g., autonomous vehicles), building service offerings for commercial truck fleets, making the tire buying process easier for consumers, and

strengthening the Company's competitive position. For example, in 2018, the Company formed TireHub, a joint venture that combined Goodyear's company-owned wholesale distribution business with Bridgestone's tire wholesale warehouse business to enhance its distribution footprint. In addition, the Company is disrupting traditional tire retail models with its direct-to-consumer eCommerce platform — the first by a major tire manufacturer — and Roll by Goodyear retail stores at lifestyle centers. The Company is also piloting new manufacturing technology to more efficiently make the higher value tires of the future while building relationships with both existing and emerging automotive companies. 
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock. 
  Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST approval of this shareholder proposal (Proposal 4).

Our telephone number is: 330-796-2121 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Goodyear to be voted at the Annual Meeting, and at any adjournments thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice. 
Our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 is enclosed with this Proxy Statement. The Annual Report is not considered part of the proxy solicitation materials. The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and the related materials are first being sent to shareholders is March 8, 2019. 
Shares Voting 
Holders of Common Stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote the shares of Common Stock they hold on the record date at, the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 232,264,013 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. 
Vote Required 
In accordance with Goodyear's Articles of Incorporation, a director nominee must receive, in an uncontested election of directors, a greater number of votes cast "for" his or her election than "against" his or her election. You may not vote cumulatively in the election of directors. 
Under Ohio law, an incumbent director who is not re-elected will continue in office as a "holdover" director until his or her successor is elected by a subsequent shareholder vote, or his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. In order to address "holdover" terms for any incumbent directors who fail to be re-elected under our majority vote standard, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if a director nominee does not receive a majority affirmative vote, he or she will promptly offer his or her resignation as a director to the Board of Directors. Within 90 days, the Board will decide, after taking into account the recommendation of the Governance Committee (in each case excluding the nominee(s) in question), whether to accept the resignation. The Governance Committee and the Board may consider any relevant factors in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. The Board's explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date is required for a management or shareholder proposal, other than an advisory vote, to be adopted at the Annual Meeting. When considering the results of advisory votes, the Board of Directors intends to consider only those votes actually cast at the Annual Meeting. 
Abstentions and "broker non-votes," which occur when your broker does not have discretionary voting authority on a matter and you do not provide voting instructions, have the same effect as votes against any proposal voted upon by shareholders but have no effect on the election of directors or advisory votes.

The holders of a majority of shares represented at the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn the meeting. If the time and place of the adjourned meeting is announced at the time adjournment is taken, no other notice need be given. 
Voting Shares Held in Street Name 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee regarding how to vote your shares. If you do not return the voting instruction card, the broker or other nominee will determine if it has the discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter. Under applicable rules, brokers have the discretion to vote only on matters deemed to be routine, such as the ratification of the selection of an accounting firm (Proposal 3). The election of directors (Proposal 1), the executive compensation advisory vote (Proposal 2) and the shareholder proposal (Proposal 4) are not considered to be routine matters, and your broker will not have discretion to vote on those matters unless you specifically instruct your broker to do so by returning your signed voting instruction card. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted for any director nominee or on any matter on which your broker does not have discretionary authority (resulting in a broker non-vote).

A separate "Confidential Voting Instructions" card is being sent to each employee or former employee participating in the Goodyear Common Stock fund of certain employee savings plans. Shares of Common Stock held in the trusts for these plans will be voted by the trustee as instructed by the plan participants who participate in the Goodyear Common Stock fund. Shares held in the trusts for which voting instructions are not received will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion as it votes shares for which voting instructions were received from participants in the Goodyear Common Stock fund of the applicable trust. 
Voting of Proxy 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be Held on April 8, 2019: 
The Proxy Statement, Proxy Card and Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
David L. Bialosky, Darren R. Wells and Daniel T. Young have been designated as proxies to vote shares of Common Stock in accordance with your instructions. You may give your instructions using the accompanying proxy card, via the internet or by telephone. 
You may vote your shares using the internet by accessing the following web site: http://www.proxyvote.com or by making a toll-free telephone call within the United States of America or Canada using a touch-tone telephone to the toll-free number provided on your proxy card, or if you hold your shares in "street name," on the voting instruction card provided by your broker or nominee. 
Your shares will be voted for the thirteen nominees identified at pages 13 through 19, unless your instructions are to vote against any one or more of the nominees.

Shareholders Sharing The Same Address 
Goodyear has adopted a procedure called "householding," which has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under this procedure, Goodyear is delivering only one copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement to multiple shareholders who share the same address and have the same last name, unless Goodyear has received contrary instructions from an affected shareholder. This procedure reduces Goodyear's printing costs, mailing costs and fees. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. 
Goodyear will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement to any shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of either of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the Annual Report or Proxy Statement, you may write or call Goodyear's Investor Relations Department at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 200 Innovation Way, Akron, Ohio 44316-0001, Attention: Investor Relations, telephone (330) 796-3751. You may also access Goodyear's Annual Report and Proxy Statement on the Investor Relations section of Goodyear's website at www.goodyear.com or at www.proxyvote.com. 
If you are a holder of record and would like to revoke your householding consent and receive a separate copy of the Annual Report or Proxy Statement in the future, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, either by calling toll free at (866) 540-7095 or by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, Attention: Householding Department. You will be removed from the householding program within 30 days of receipt of the revocation of your consent. 
Any shareholders of record who share the same address and currently receive multiple copies of Goodyear's Annual Report and Proxy Statement who wish to receive only one copy of these materials per household in the future should contact Goodyear's Investor Relations Department at the address or telephone number listed above to participate in the householding program. 
A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding. If you hold your shares in "street name," please contact your bank, broker or other holder of record to request information about householding. 
Form 10-K 
Goodyear will mail without charge, upon written request, a copy of Goodyear's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including the Consolidated Financial Statements, schedules and list of exhibits, and any particular exhibit specifically requested. Requests should be sent to: The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 200 Innovation Way, Akron, Ohio 44316-0001, Attn: Investor Relations. The Annual Report on Form 10-K is also available at www.goodyear.com.

Costs of Solicitation 
The costs of soliciting proxies will be borne by Goodyear. Goodyear has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., 48 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, to assist in distributing proxy materials and soliciting proxies for an estimated fee of $14,500, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. D.F. King & Co. may solicit proxies from shareholders by mail, telephone or the internet. In addition, officers or other employees of Goodyear may, without additional compensation, solicit proxies in person or by telephone or the internet. 
Submission of Shareholder Proposals and Nominations 
If a shareholder desires to have a proposal included in the proxy materials of the Board of Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, such proposal shall conform to the applicable proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the submission and content of proposals, including Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and must be received by Goodyear prior to the close of business on November 8, 2019. If an eligible shareholder, or a group of up to 20 eligible shareholders, desires to have a candidate for election as a director included in the proxy materials of the Board of Directors (a "proxy access nominee") for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, such nomination shall conform to the applicable requirements set forth in Article II, Section 2A of the Company's Code of Regulations and any applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the submission and content of proxy access nominations, and must be submitted to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than October 10, 2019 and not later than the close of business on November 8, 2019. In addition, if a shareholder intends to present a proposal or other business (not including a proposal submitted for inclusion in our proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8) or to nominate a candidate for election as a director (not including a proxy access nominee) at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholder's notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not earlier than December 10, 2019 and not later than the close of business on January 9, 2020. If notice of a proposal or a director nomination is not received by the Company in accordance with the dates specified pursuant to Rule 14a-8 or in the Code of Regulations, as the case may be, then the proposal or director nomination will be deemed untimely and we will have the right to exclude the proposal or director nomination from consideration at the meeting and/or to exercise discretionary voting authority and vote proxies returned to us with respect to such proposal or director nomination. Shareholder proposals or director nominations should be sent to the executive offices of Goodyear, 200 Innovation Way, Akron, Ohio 44316-0001, Attention: Office of the Secretary. 
For a proposal or director nomination to be properly presented at an annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must comply with the deadlines described in the preceding paragraph, as well as all of the other requirements of the Code of Regulations. Goodyear reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal or director nomination that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.

In 2018, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company launched innovative business models in distribution and retail with the goal of making Goodyear tires easier for our customers to sell and easier for consumers to buy, own and recommend. We also continued developing important business relationships to help shape the future of mobility. These initiatives illustrate how Goodyear is executing the How Well Win elements of its Strategy Roadmap. During 2018, we formed TireHub , a new national wholesale tire distributor in the U.S. Complemented by our network of aligned regional distributors and designed to provide best-in-class service, TireHub enhances our ability to capture the full value of the Goodyear brand by selling the full depth and breadth of our product portfolio. This launch increases our Operational Excellence by enhancing our ability to deliver the right tire to the right place, at the right time, for the right cost. A new retail format called Roll by Goodyear was piloted in two U.S. markets. Located in high-traffic life-style centers and business districts, Roll offers consumers an option to shop for tires on their terms and select the installation option that best fits their busy schedules. Roll is an example of Sales & Marketing Excellence, as it builds the value of the Goodyear brand and makes it easier for consumers to choose and recommend our products and services. Goodyears commitment to Innovation Excellence comes to life in its work on autonomous vehicles. We teamed with Arizona-based Local Motors to conduct tire testing with Olli , an eight-passenger autonomous shuttle, on which Goodyear earned the exclusive fitment. The test work allows Goodyear to study the operation and maintenance of autonomous vehicles, including future tire technology options.

 Goodyear is one of the world's leading tire companies, with operations in most regions of the world. Together with its U.S.  and international subsidiaries, Goodyear develops, manufactures, markets and distributes tires for most applications.
