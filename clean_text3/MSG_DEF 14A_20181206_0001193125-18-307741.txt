 PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 6, 2018 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
COMPANY OVERVIEW 
The Madison Square Garden Company, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries. Our Class A Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "MSG." As a result, we are subject to certain of the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. 
The Company, formerly named MSG Spinco, Inc., was incorporated on March 4, 2015 as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of MSG Networks Inc. ("MSG Networks"). We changed our name to The Madison Square Garden 
 Company on September 30, 2015 (the "MSG Distribution Date") in connection with the distribution of all of the Company's outstanding common stock to the stockholders of MSG Networks (the "MSG Distribution"). Pursuant to the MSG Distribution, the Company acquired the entertainment and sports businesses previously owned and operated by MSG Networks through its MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports business segments, including the arenas and other venues previously owned, leased or operated by MSG Networks as well as MSG Networks' interests in various joint ventures. 
PROXY STATEMENT MATERIALS 
These proxy materials are provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, December 6, 2018, at the J.P. Morgan Club at the Madison Square Garden Arena, which is located on Seventh Avenue between West 31st Street and West 33rd Street, New York, NY. 
In this proxy statement, the words "Company," "we," "us," "our," "Madison Square Garden" and "MSG" refer to The Madison Square Garden Company, a Delaware corporation. This proxy statement and form of proxy are first being sent to stockholders on or about October 25, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, references to "2018," the "2018 fiscal year" and the "year ended June 30, 2018" refer to the Company's fiscal year ended on June 30, 2018. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Who may vote at the annual meeting? 
Holders of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common Stock"), and holders of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common Stock," together with Class A Common Stock, collectively, "Company Stock"), as recorded in our stock register at the close of business on October 16, 2018, may vote at the meeting. On 
 October 16, 2018, there were 19,222,045 shares of Class A Common Stock and 4,529,517 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. Each share of Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and holders will be voting for the election of five candidates to the Board. Each share of Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share and holders will be voting for the election of nine candidates to the Board. As a result of their ownership of all of the shares of   Class B Common Stock, members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities, have the power to elect all of the directors to be elected by the holders of Class B Common Stock, and to approve Proposal 2, regardless of how other shares are voted. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials by Internet. Accordingly, the Company has sent a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to our stockholders. All stockholders have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials by Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. In addition, our stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically. If you previously chose to receive proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive access to these materials via email unless you otherwise elect. The Company encourages our stockholders who have not already done so to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the cost and the environmental impact of the annual meeting. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials was sent directly to you by the Company. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will also receive a proxy card. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization how to vote the shares held in your account. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form from that organization. 
What votes need to be present to hold the annual meeting? 
In order to carry on the business of the annual meeting, we need a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding shares eligible to vote on October 16, 2018 to be present, in person or by proxy. This is known as a "quorum." If voting on a particular action is by class, a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding shares of such class constitutes a quorum for such action. Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are considered present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
How do I vote? 
You may vote in advance of the annual meeting by telephone, Internet or mail by following the instructions provided on the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you choose to vote by mail, please sign, date and return the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. You may also vote in person or by legal proxy at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting in person, the Board strongly recommends that you vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the annual meeting.  Can my broker vote my shares without instructions from me? 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you must instruct them how to vote your shares. Please use the voting instruction form provided to you by your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization to direct them how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on the election of directors or any other proposal on which the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization can register your shares as being present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under applicable rules. 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization has discretionary voting authority under applicable rules to vote your shares on the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent auditors (Proposal 2), even if the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors (Proposal 1) without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
Election of directors by the holders of our Class A Common Stock requires the affirmative vote of the plurality of votes cast by holders of our Class A Common Stock. Election of directors by the holders of our Class B Common Stock requires the affirmative vote of the plurality of votes cast by holders of our Class B Common Stock. Approval of Proposal 2 requires the favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of our Class A Common Stock and the holders of our Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the proposals because abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast. As a result of their ownership of all of the shares of our Class B Common Stock, members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities, have the power to elect all of the directors to be elected by the holders of our Class B Common Stock, and to approve Proposal 2, regardless of how other shares are voted. 
Can I change my vote after I have voted? 
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the annual meeting. You may change your vote prior to the annual meeting by:  If your shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you should follow the instructions they provide in order to change your vote. 
How will my shares be voted at the annual meeting if I submit a proxy card? 
The proxy materials, including the proxy card, are being solicited on behalf of the Board. The Company representatives appointed by the Board (the persons named on the proxy card, or, if applicable, their substitutes) will vote your shares as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your shares will be voted as the Board recommends, which is: 
Who participates in and pays for this solicitation? 
The Company will bear the expense of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying materials. Solicitation of individual stockholders may be made by mail, personal interviews, telephone, facsimile, electronic delivery or other telecommunications by our executive officers and regular employees who will receive no additional compensation for such activities. 
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee estimated not to exceed $25,000, plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, we will reimburse brokers and other nominees for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners. 
How do I attend the 2018 annual meeting in person and what identification must I show? 
An admission ticket will be required if you plan to attend the annual meeting in person. Without an admission ticket, you will not be able to attend the annual meeting. To be admitted to the 2018 annual meeting, you must have been a stockholder at the close of business on the record date of October 16, 2018 or be the legal proxy holder or qualified representative of such stockholder. You must bring with you, your admission ticket and a valid government-issued photo identification card (federal, state or local), such as a driver's license or passport. Persons without an admission ticket and proper identification will be denied admission to the annual meeting. Registration will begin at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the annual meeting date. 
Your proxy card is not an admission ticket. To obtain an admission ticket, go to www.proxyvote.com or call 1-844-318-0137 (toll-free) or 925-331-6070 (international). You will need to enter your 16-digit control number, which can be found on your Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, voting instruction form or proxy card. You may also request an admission ticket by calling the telephone number on your voting instruction form or proxy card. The deadline to obtain an admission ticket is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 26, 2018. If you have questions about admission to the annual meeting, please call 1-844-318-0137 (toll-free) or 925-331-6070 (international).  Please note that you will need your admission ticket to be admitted to the annual meeting whether you vote before or at the meeting, and regardless of whether you are a registered or beneficial stockholder. If you are attending the meeting as a proxy or qualified representative for a stockholder, you will need to bring your legal proxy or authorization letter in addition to your admission ticket and government-issued photo identification card. 
Stockholders must provide advance written notice to the Company if they intend to have a legal proxy (other than the persons appointed as proxies on the Company's proxy card) or a qualified representative attend the annual meeting on their behalf. The notice must include the name and address of the legal proxy or qualified representative and must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 26, 2018 in order to allow enough time for the issuance of an admission ticket to such person. For further details, see "Other Matters — Advance Notice of Proxy Holders and Qualified Representatives." 
Please note that cameras, video and audio recording equipment and other similar electronic devices, as well as large bags (including backpacks, handbags and briefcases) and packages will need to be checked at the door. Additionally, the Company may impose additional restrictions on items that must be checked at the door as well as on the conduct of the meeting. To ensure the safety of all persons, attendees and bags may also be subject to security inspections. 
Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order received. Please note that seating is limited, and requests for tickets will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
Stockholders of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials may receive only one copy of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the "2018 Form 10-K") unless we are notified that one or more of these stockholders wishes to receive individual copies. This "householding" procedure will reduce our printing costs and postage fees. 
Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. If you are eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents, or if you hold MSG stock in more than one account, and, in either case, you wish to receive only a single copy of each of these documents for your household, please contact 
Broadridge Householding Department, by calling their toll-free number, 1-866-540-7095 or by writing to: Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. 
If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents, or if you do not wish to continue to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of these documents in the future, please contact Broadridge Householding Department as indicated above. You will be removed from the householding program within 30 days of receipt of your instructions at which time you will then be sent separate copies of the documents. 
If you are a beneficial owner, you can request information about householding from your broker, bank or other holder of record. 
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
This Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, the proxy card and the Company's 2018 Form 10-K, along with instructions on how   to obtain an admission ticket, which is required to attend the annual meeting in person, are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
In accordance with the SEC rules, we are using the Internet as our primary means of furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders. Consequently, most of our stockholders will not receive paper copies of our proxy materials. Instead we are sending these stockholders a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials with instructions for accessing the proxy materials, including our proxy statement and 2018 Form 10-K, and voting via the Internet. This makes the proxy distribution process more efficient and less costly, and helps conserve natural resources. The Notice of Annual 
 Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also provides information on how our stockholders may obtain paper copies of our proxy materials if they so choose. If you previously elected to receive proxy materials electronically, these materials will continue to be sent via email unless you change your election. 
If you receive paper copies of our proxy materials and would like to sign up for electronic delivery via email or the Internet, please follow the instructions to vote by Internet at www.proxyvote.com and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access stockholder communications electronically in future years.  BOARD AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
OVERVIEW 
The following section provides an overview of our Board and corporate governance practices. We have taken several actions to be responsive to stockholder feedback, including expanding our stockholder outreach efforts and enhancing our proxy disclosure to provide greater transparency to our stockholders. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
Our Board has adopted the Governance Guidelines and other practices to promote the functioning of the Board and its committees to serve the best interests of all our stockholders. The Governance Guidelines provide a framework for our governance practices, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Annual election of directors, with all directors serving one-year terms   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Board composition to include a broad range of skills, experience, industry knowledge, diversity of opinion and  contacts relevant to the Companys business that serves the interests of the holders of both our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Board self-assessments conducted at least annually to assess the mix of skills and experience that directors  bring to the Board to facilitate an effective oversight function  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Robust director nomination criteria to ensure a diversity of viewpoints, background and expertise in the  boardroom  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Regular executive sessions of independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Independent Board committees, with each of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee comprised 100% of  independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Restricted stock units subject to holding requirement through the end of service on the Board   
[END TABLE]
Our Governance Guidelines set forth our practices and policies with respect to Board composition and selection, Board meetings, executive sessions of the Board, Board committees, the expectations we have of our directors, selection of the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, management succession, Board and executive compensation, and Board self-assessment requirements. The full text of our Governance Guidelines may be viewed at our corporate website at www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com under Investors — Corporate Governance. A copy may be obtained by writing to The Madison Square Garden Company, Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10121; Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Fostering long-term relationships with our stockholders is a priority for the Company. Engagement helps us gain insight into the issues most important to our stockholders, informing 
 Board discussions and allowing us to consider investors' views on a range of topics including corporate governance and executive compensation matters.  We regularly engage with stockholders, and during each of the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, we have engaged with holders of approximately 70% and two-thirds, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock concerning our Board, governance and executive compensation practices, with the specific` goal of seeking stockholder feedback. We greatly value the views of our stockholders, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board has the flexibility to determine whether the roles of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separated or combined. The Board makes this decision based on its evaluation of the circumstances and the Company's specific needs. Effective November 2017, Mr. James L. Dolan became Chief Executive Officer, which had the effect of combining the roles of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes this is the optimal leadership structure for the Company at this time as it recognizes Mr. James L. Dolan's senior executive role with the Company as well as his leadership position on the Company's Board. The Board believes that this is appropriate because of Mr. Dolan's familiarity with the Company's business and industry, as well as his ability to most effectively identify strategic priorities of the Company and ensure execution of the Company's strategy. 
BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT 
The Board conducts an annual self-assessment to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. Among other things, the Board's self-assessment seeks input from the directors on whether they have the tools and access necessary to perform their oversight function as well as suggestions for improvement of the Board's functioning. In addition, our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee each conducts its own annual self-assessment, which includes an assessment of the adequacy of their performance as compared to their respective charters. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF NON-MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS 
Under our Governance Guidelines, either our directors who are not also executive officers of our Company (the "non-management directors") or our directors who are independent under the NYSE rules are required to meet regularly in executive sessions with no members of management present. If non-management directors who are not independent participate in these executive sessions, the independent directors under the NYSE rules are required to meet separately in executive sessions at least once each year. 
RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our Board believes that risk oversight is an important Board responsibility. The Audit Committee takes the lead on behalf of the Board in this risk oversight role. The Audit Committee discusses guidelines and policies governing the process by which the Company's management assesses and manages the Company's exposure to risk, and discusses the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The 
 Compensation Committee considers the Company's exposure to risk in establishing and implementing our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, reviewed the level of risk incentivized by the Company's executive compensation program as well as incentive programs below the executive officer level. Based on this assessment and the executive compensation program's   emphasis on long-term performance, its close connection to Company-wide and divisional performance and its equity-based component designed to align the executives officer's compensation with the Company's long-term strategy and growth, the Compensation Committee determined that our executive compensation program does not create incentives for excessive risk-taking that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
COMMUNICATING WITH OUR DIRECTORS 
Our Board has adopted policies designed to allow our stockholders and other interested parties to communicate with our directors. Any interested party who wishes to communicate directly with the Board or any director or the non-management directors as a group should send communications in writing to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, The Madison Square Garden Company, Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, 
 NY 10121. Any person, whether or not an employee, who has a concern with respect to our accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing issues or other matters, may, in a confidential or anonymous manner, communicate those concerns to our Audit Committee by contacting the MSG Integrity Hotline, which is operated by a third-party service provider, at 1-877-756-4306. 
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics for our directors, officers and employees. A portion of this Code of Conduct and Ethics also serves as a code of conduct and ethics for our senior financial officers, including our principal accounting officer and controller. Among other things, our Code of Conduct and Ethics covers conflicts of interest, disclosure responsibilities, legal compliance, reporting and compliance with the Code of Conduct and Ethics, confidentiality, corporate opportunities, fair dealing, protection and proper use of Company assets and equal employment opportunity and harassment. The full text of the Code of Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com. In addition, a copy may be obtained by writing to The Madison Square Garden Company, Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10121; Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
As a "controlled company" we have the right to elect not to comply with the corporate governance rules of the NYSE requiring: (i) a majority of independent directors on our Board, (ii) an independent corporate governance and nominating committee, and (iii) an independent compensation committee. Because of our status as a "controlled company" we have elected not to maintain a majority of independent directors on our Board or to have a corporate governance and nominating committee. We elect to maintain an independent compensation committee. 
Our Board elected not to comply with the requirement for a majority of independent directors on our Board because of our voting structure. Under the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of our Class B Common Stock have the right to elect up to 75% of the members of our Board and there is no requirement that any of those directors be independent or be chosen independently.  Our Board has determined that each of the following non-management directors and director nominees is "independent" within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and the SEC: Frank J., Biondi, Jr., Joseph J. Lhota, Richard D. Parsons, Nelson Peltz, Alan D. Schwartz, Scott M. Sperling and Vincent Tese. In reaching its determination, the Board considered the following: 
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS 
As permitted under the NYSE rules, we do not have a nominating committee and believe it is appropriate not to have one because of our stockholder voting structure. The Board has nonetheless established a nomination mechanism in our Governance Guidelines for the selection of nominees for election as directors by the holders of our Class A Common Stock ("Class A Directors") and by the holders of our Class B Common Stock ("Class B Directors"), as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       of the independent Class A Directors then in office.  
[END TABLE]
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides holders of the Company's Class B Common Stock the right to elect up to 75% of the members of our Board and holders of our Class A Common Stock the right to elect 25% of the members of our Board.  DIRECTOR SELECTION 
Our Board believes that each director nominee should be evaluated based on the skills needed on the Board and his or her individual merits, taking into account, among other matters, the factors set forth in our Governance Guidelines under "Board Composition" and "Selection of Directors." Those factors include: 
The Class A Directors evaluate and recommend Class A Director candidates to the Board for nomination as Class A Directors and suggest individuals for the Board to explore in more depth. The Board also considers Class A Director nominees recommended by our stockholders. Nominees recommended by our stockholders are given consideration in the same manner as other nominees. Stockholders who wish to submit nominees for consideration by the Board for election at our 2019 annual meeting of our stockholders may do so by submitting in writing such nominees' names, in compliance with the procedures and along with other information required by the Company's Amended By-Laws. See "Other Matters — Stockholder Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting." 
The Class B Directors will consult from time to time with one or more of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to ensure that all Class B Director nominees recommended to the Board are individuals who will make a meaningful contribution as Board members and will be individuals likely to receive the approving vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding Class B Common Stock. The Class B Directors do not intend to consider unsolicited suggestions of nominees by holders of our Class A Common Stock. We believe that this is appropriate in light of the voting provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation which provide the holders of our Class B Common Stock the exclusive right to elect our Class B Directors. 
BOARD MEETINGS 
The Board met five times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Each of our directors who was on the Board during the 2018 fiscal year attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees of the Board on which he or she served during 2018. 
We encourage our directors to attend annual meetings of our stockholders and believe that attendance at annual meetings is just as important as attendance at Board and committee meetings. All of the incumbent directors, except three, attended the 2017 annual stockholders' meeting.  COMMITTEES 
Our board has two standing committees comprised solely of independent directors: the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. 
Audit Committee 
The primary purposes and responsibilities of our Audit Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       by Company employees or any provider of accounting-related services of concerns regarding questionable accounting and auditing matters and review of submissions and treatment of any such  complaints;  
[END TABLE]
Our Board has determined that each member of our Audit Committee is "independent" within the meaning of the rules of both the NYSE and the SEC, and that each has not participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past three years and is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Our Board has also determined that each of Messrs. Parsons, Schwartz and Tese is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. 
Our Board has established a procedure whereby complaints or concerns with respect to accounting, internal controls, auditing and other matters may be submitted to the Audit Committee. This procedure is described under   "Board and Governance Practices — Communicating with Our Directors." 
The text of our Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com. A copy may be obtained by writing to The Madison Square Garden Company, Corporate Secretary, Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10121. 
Compensation Committee 
The primary purposes and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       compensation matters, including overseeing the Company's policies on structuring compensation programs to preserve tax deductibility, and, as and when required, establishing performance  goals and certifying that performance goals have been attained for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code");  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the Senior Employees, evaluates their performance in light of those goals and objectives and, either as a committee or together with any other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determines and approves the Senior Employees' compensation level based on this evaluation. In determining the long-term incentive component of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, the Compensation Committee considers, among other factors, the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to Chief Executive Officers at comparable companies and the awards given to the Chief Executive Officer in past years.  As discussed above, our Board has determined that each member of our Compensation Committee is "independent" under the rules of the NYSE. 
The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate a portion of its duties and responsibilities to one or more subcommittees of the Compensation Committee. For example, the Compensation Committee may delegate the approval of certain transactions to a subcommittee consisting solely of members of the Compensation Committee who are (i) "non-employee directors" for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and (ii) "outside directors" for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)"). The Compensation Committee may also engage outside compensation consultants to assist in the performance of its duties and responsibilities. The text of our Compensation Committee charter is available on our website at www.themadisonsquaregardencompany.com. A copy may be obtained by writing to The Madison Square Garden Company, Corporate Secretary, Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10121. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Scott M. Sperling, Joseph J. Lhota and Vincent Tese currently serve as members of the Compensation Committee. None of them is a current nor a former executive officer or employee of the Company. 
Independent Committee 
In addition to standing committees, the Company has adopted a policy whereby a committee of our Board consisting entirely of independent directors (an "Independent Committee") will review and approve or take such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries in which any director, executive officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation 
S-K adopted by the SEC) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404, which currently apply to transactions (or any series of similar transactions) in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. 
Our Board has adopted a special approval policy for transactions with MSG Networks and AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries whether or not such transactions qualify as "related party" transactions described above. Under this policy, the Independent Committee oversees approval of all transactions and arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each of MSG Networks and its subsidiaries and AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in which the amount exceeds $120,000. To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, the Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of these transactions. Currently, and throughout our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Audit Committee served as the Independent Committee under the above policies. For a further discussion of the scope of these policies, see "Related Party Transaction Approval Policy." 
Special Committee 
In connection with the Company's exploration of a possible spin-off that would create a separately-traded public company comprised of its sports businesses, including the Knicks and Rangers professional sports franchises, the Company formed a special committee on June 27, 2018. The special committee consists of Messrs. Frank J. Biondi, Jr. and Richard D. Parsons. 
Other Committee Matters 
Our Amended By-Laws permit the Board to form an Executive Committee of the Board which would have the power to exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board in the   management of the business and affairs of the Company, except as limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our Board has not formed an Executive Committee, although it could do so in the future. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The following table describes the components of our non-management directors' compensation program in effect during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation  Element(1)      Compensation 
  Meeting Fees      $2,000 per meeting (in person)  $500 per meeting (by telephone)     
  Meeting Fees      $2,000 per meeting (in person)  $500 per meeting (by telephone)     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  A director who is also a Company employee receives no compensation for serving as a director.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Each director receives an annual grant of restricted stock units determined by dividing the value of the annual  equity retainer by the 20-trading day average closing price on the day prior to the grant date (typically the annual stockholders' meeting). Restricted stock units are fully vested on the date of grant  but remain subject to a holding   
[END TABLE]
In order for our directors to develop an intimate familiarity with the different types of events presented at our venues, the services and support offered to patrons at our events and the characteristics and features of our venues, the Company makes available to each of our non-management directors without charge up to two tickets per event for up to eight events per calendar year, subject to availability. Director attendance at such events is integrally and directly related to the performance of their duties and, as such, we do not deem the receipt of such tickets to be perquisites. These ticket limitations do not apply to special events to which non-management directors and their guests may have been specifically invited from time to time in their capacity as non-management directors of the Company (e.g., charity concerts, premieres, etc.). In addition, non-management directors are able to purchase tickets to events from the Company at face value, subject to availability. Tickets provided to non-management directors are not available for resale.  Director Compensation Table 
The table below summarizes the total compensation paid to or earned by each person who served as a non-management director during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Directors who are employees of the Company receive no compensation for service as directors and are therefore not identified in the table below.

(1)  These amounts represent retainer, committee, board and independent director meeting fees earned during the  fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The amounts reported do not include any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings for which the Company  reimburses each non-management director.

(2)  This column reflects the grant date fair market value of 513 restricted stock units granted on  December 15, 2017, to each non-management director, as calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718.  The values reflected in this column differ from the $110,000 value set forth in our directors' compensation program because the value calculated under ASC Topic 718 differs from the 20-trading day average  used to determine the number of shares granted to directors.   
(3)  For each non-management director, the aggregate number of restricted  stock units held as of June 30, 2018 is as follows: Frank J. Biondi, Jr., 1,148 units; Charles F.

 PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board has nominated 14 director candidates named below. Following a vacancy in the directors elected by the holders of our Class B Common Stock created in March 2018, the size of the Board was reduced from 15 to 14 directors. Of the 14 director nominees, five are to be elected by the holders of our Class A Common Stock and nine are to be elected by the holders of our Class B Common Stock. All 14 candidates have been nominated for a term to expire at the 2019 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. 
The Company representatives appointed by the Board (the persons named on the proxy card, or, if applicable, their substitutes) will vote your shares as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your shares will be voted to elect each of the director nominees below, as applicable, based on whether you are a holder of our Class A Common Stock or our Class B Common Stock. 
Each director nominee listed below has consented to being named in this proxy statement and has agreed to serve if elected. However, if a nominee for election as a director by the holders of our Class A Common Stock becomes unavailable before the election or for good cause will not serve, the persons named on the Class A proxy card would be authorized to vote for a replacement director nominee for election as a director by the holders of our Class A Common Stock if the Board names one. If a nominee for election as a director by the holders of our Class B Common Stock becomes unavailable before the election or for good cause will not serve, the persons named on the Class B proxy card would be authorized to vote for a replacement director nominee for election as a director by the holders of our Class B Common Stock if the Board names one.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting, internal controls, and audit functions. As set forth in the charter of the Audit Committee, management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's accounting and financial reporting principles, and the Company's internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Company has an in-house Internal Audit Department that reports to the Audit Committee and management. This department provides the Audit Committee and management an independent review function, including reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of the Company's system of internal controls. 
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the consolidated financial statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG the audited financial statements and its evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the firm's independence. All audit and non-audit services performed by KPMG must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee or by its Chairman (and subject to ratification by the full committee). 
As part of its responsibilities for oversight of the risk management process, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's risk assessment and risk management framework, including discussions of individual risk areas as well as a summary of the overall process. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's Internal Audit Department and KPMG, the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Audit Committee met with the head of the Internal Audit Department and representatives of KPMG in regular and executive sessions to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs. 
Based upon the reports, reviews and discussions described in this report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC.

Vincent Tese (Chair)  LETTER FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
Dear Fellow Stockholder, 
We thank you for your continued support of The Madison Square Garden Company. We wish to share with you how the Compensation Committee continues to evolve our executive compensation program and practices to support our long-term strategic goals and drive stockholder value creation. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews our compensation structure against the following four over-arching principles that we believe are core to pay and performance alignment and appropriately motivate our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of each executive officer's compensation opportunity should be at risk based on  Company and stock performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives should generally comprise a greater proportion of total compensation than short-term  incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity compensation should be a meaningful component of total compensation in order to establish a direct  alignment of interests between executive officers and our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We should attract, retain, motivate and reward the best talent in a competitive industry.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also seeks to include the input of our stockholders in the regular evaluation of our programs. During the 2018 fiscal year, management of the Company engaged with holders of approximately two-thirds of our Class A Common Stock to discuss our Board, governance and compensation practices, with the specific goal of seeking stockholder feedback. 
Further detail on our compensation program is included in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis that follows. We are committed to maintaining a compensation structure that aligns pay with performance and effectively motivates our executive officers to continue driving long-term value creation for our stockholders. We welcome continued stockholder feedback on our executive compensation practices.

Stockholder Engagement & Responsiveness 
During each of the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, we have engaged with holders of approximately 70% and two-thirds, respectively, of our Class A Common Stock concerning our Board, governance and executive compensation practices, with the specific goal of seeking stockholder feedback. 
In direct response to our stockholder feedback and the Compensation Committee's regular review of our programs, and in consultation with the compensation consultant, during the 2017 fiscal year we made several enhancements that we believe further align our compensation practices with our long-term strategy and the interests of our stockholders. Such enhancements include the improvement of disclosures regarding incentive program design, goal achievement against targets, and the alignment of incentive payouts with sustained Company performance, as well as the adoption of an anti-pledging policy. 
We value the views of our stockholders, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue to inform the Compensation Committee's ongoing review of the program.  Executive Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy 
The Company is a sports and entertainment business comprised of dynamic and powerful assets and brands. We operate in specialized industries and our executive officers have substantial and meaningful professional experience in these industries. The Company places great importance on its ability to attract, retain, motivate and reward experienced executive officers who can drive our business objectives and achieve strong financial, operational and stock price performance. The Compensation Committee has designed executive compensation policies and programs that are consistent with, explicitly linked to, and supportive of, the financial and strategic objectives of growing the Company's businesses and maximizing long-term stockholder value. 
Our Compensation Committee has designed a program that reflects four key overarching executive compensation principles:

In designing our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee seeks to fulfill these objectives by maintaining appropriate balances between (1) short-term and long-term compensation, (2) cash and equity compensation, and (3) performance-based and time-based vesting of compensation. 
Elements of Compensation 
The Company compensates its NEOs through base salary, annual incentive awards, long-term incentive awards, perquisites and benefit programs. Our annual and long-term incentive programs provide performance-based incentives for our NEOs tied to key financial and strategic measures that drive stockholder value and reward sustained achievement of the Company's key financial goals. The Company considers Total Company Net Revenue and AOI to be the key measures of its operating performance. As such, our Compensation Committee has incorporated these performance measures into our annual incentive awards and long-term incentive performance equity awards, along with other specific strategic and operating measures. The Company's long-term incentive program also includes restricted stock units whose value is tied to the performance of the market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock.  The table below summarizes the current elements of our compensation program and how each element supports the Company's compensation objectives:

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION PROGRAM PRACTICES AND POLICIES 
The following discussion describes the practices and policies implemented by the Compensation Committee during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. For the 2018 fiscal year, compensation for the NEOs was subject to employment agreements approved by the Company's Compensation Committee. Information concerning the Company's current employment agreements with each NEO is set forth below under "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements." 
In the Company's most recent advisory "say-on-pay" proposal, which was held in 2016, a majority of stockholders voted to approve on an advisory basis the Company's executive compensation. The Compensation Committee considered the results of this vote, as well as the   Company's ongoing discussions with stockholders, in its assessment and development of the compensation program. These factors, among other considerations, contributed to our decision to adopt an anti-pledging policy and enhance our disclosure related to our compensation practices during the 2017 fiscal year. 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation program. The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are set forth in its charter. Among other responsibilities, the Compensation Committee: (1) establishes our general compensation philosophy and, in consultation with management, oversees the development and implementation of compensation programs; (2) reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers who are required to file reports with the SEC under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, evaluates their performance in light of those goals and objectives, and determines and approves their respective compensation levels based on this evaluation; (3) oversees the activities of the committee or committees administering our retirement and benefit plans; and (4) administers our stockholder-approved compensation plans. For more information about the Compensation Committee, please see "Board and Governance Practices —Committees — Compensation Committee." 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to engage outside consultants to assist in the performance of its duties and responsibilities. Our Compensation Committee utilizes the services of ClearBridge Compensation Group LLC (the "compensation consultant"), an independent compensation consultant, to assist in determining whether the elements of our executive compensation program are reasonable and consistent with our objectives. 
The compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and, at the request of the Compensation Committee, the compensation consultant meets with members of management from time to time for the purpose of gathering information on management proposals and recommendations to be presented to the Compensation Committee. 
With respect to compensation matters for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the services provided by the compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee included: 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the compensation consultant provided no services to the Company other than those provided to the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee charter requires the Compensation Committee to consider the NYSE independence factors before receiving advice from an advisor, despite the fact that such independence rules are not applicable to controlled companies. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee concluded that the compensation consultant satisfies the independence requirements of the NYSE rules. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the compensation consultant's work did not raise any conflicts of interest during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered the same rules regarding advisor independence. 
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Compensation 
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance and compensation of the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and, following discussions with the compensation consultant, establishes his compensation. Senior management of the Company assists the Compensation Committee and the compensation consultant as described in this Compensation Discussion & Analysis, and provides to the Compensation Committee, either directly or through the compensation consultant, management's recommendations on the compensation for executive officers other than the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of management provide support to the Compensation Committee as needed. Based upon a review of performance and historical compensation, recommendations and information from members of management, and discussions with the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee determines and approves compensation for the executive officers. 
Performance Objectives 
As described below under "— Elements of Our Compensation Program," performance-based incentive compensation is an important element of the Company's executive compensation program. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee has historically based the performance objectives for the Company's incentive compensation on Total Company Net Revenues and/or on the AOI of the Company and its business segments. The Company considers these performance objectives to be key measures of the Company's operating performance. 
The company defines "Total Company Net Revenue" as total revenue for all business units other than specified divisions where contribution is the measure used. Contribution is revenue less event-related expenses. In those instances, management believes it serves as a more meaningful measure of revenue. 
The Company defines AOI, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses. Because it is based on operating income (loss), AOI also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. "Business Unit AOI" is based upon the AOI of the business segments less the cost of the Company's long-term incentive program that is included as an expense of the segments. At the time of grant of an award, the performance measures used may contemplate certain potential future adjustments and exclusions. 
Tally Sheets 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed tally sheets prepared by the compensation consultant, setting forth all components of compensation payable, and the benefits accruing, to the NEOs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, including all cash compensation, benefits, perquisites and the current value of outstanding equity-based awards. The tally sheets also set forth potential payouts to the NEOs upon various termination scenarios.  Determining Compensation Levels; Benchmarking 
As part of the determination of the total compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the compensation consultant assisted the Compensation Committee in: (1) determining if a peer group should be used for comparative purposes, (2) assessing executive compensation in light of internal and external considerations and (3) reviewing the Company's equity and cash-based executive incentive programs, taking into account evolving market trends. The Compensation Committee, in consultation with the compensation consultant, considered broad market data (industry-related and general industry data) and multiple broad-based compensation surveys in order to appropriately assess compensation levels. 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the compensation consultant, determined to not utilize a peer group or target positioning in determining compensation given the limited number of comparable publicly-traded companies. 
Besides the market data listed above, the Compensation Committee considered internal information (historical compensation, job responsibility, experience, parity among executive officers, contractual commitments and attraction and retention of talent) to determine compensation. 
ELEMENTS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Our executive compensation philosophy is reflected in the principal elements of our executive compensation program, each of which is important to the Company's goal of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding highly-qualified executive officers. The compensation program included the following key elements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018: base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term incentives, retirement, health and welfare and other benefits, which are generally provided to all other eligible employees, and additional executive officer benefits, including post-termination compensation under certain circumstances and certain perquisites, each as described below. 
A significant percentage of total direct compensation is allocated to incentive compensation in accordance with the Compensation Committee's philosophy. The Compensation Committee reviews historical compensation, other information provided by the compensation consultant and other factors, such as experience, performance, length of service and contractual commitments, to determine the appropriate level and mix of compensation for executive officers. The allocation between cash and equity compensation and between short-term and long-term compensation is designed to provide a variety of fixed and at-risk compensation that is related to the achievement of the Company's short-term and long-term objectives. 
Mr. Dolan is also employed by MSG Networks as its Executive Chairman and Mr. Burian is also employed by MSG Networks as its Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Messrs. Dolan and Burian receive separate compensation from MSG Networks with respect to such employment. For more information regarding the respective compensation of Messrs. Dolan and Burian by MSG Networks, see MSG Networks' Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018. 
Base Salaries 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the base salaries of the executive officers, which are intended to compensate them for the day-to-day services that they perform for the Company. Base salaries for these executive officers have been set at levels that are intended to reflect the competitive marketplace in attracting and retaining quality executive officers. The employment agreements between the   Company and the NEOs contain a base salary level. For information regarding these base salary levels, please see "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" below. The Compensation Committee reviews the salaries of the executive officers at least annually. The Compensation Committee may adjust base salaries for executive officers over time, based on their performance and experience and in accordance with the terms of their employment agreements. 
The base salaries paid by the Company to each of Messrs. Dolan, Lustgarten and O'Connor, Ms. Coleman, and Messrs. Burian and Yospe in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were as follows: $1,000,000, $914,423, $692,308, $900,000, $700,000, and $515,370, respectively. As previously noted, Mr. O'Connor departed the Company in November 2017, and thus the base salary paid to Mr. O'Connor reflects his employment with the Company through the date of his departure (based on an annual base salary of $2,000,000). The base salary paid to Mr. Lustgarten, who was promoted to President of the Company on December 15, 2017, includes base salary paid to him prior to December 15, 2017 for his services as Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy of the Company. See footnote 1 to "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table" for additional information regarding the base salaries paid during the Company's fiscal year. Effective September 1, 2018, annual base salaries of Mr. Lustgarten, Ms. Coleman, and Messrs. Burian and Yospe were increased to $1,500,000, $1,200,000, $840,000 and $536,000, respectively. The base salary for Mr. Dolan is $1,000,000 and did not change from the prior year. The Compensation Committee determined salaries for NEOs after evaluation of Company and individual performance, market pay levels, the range of increases generally provided to the Company's employees and, to the extent appropriate, management's recommendations. 
Annual Cash Incentives 
Overview 
Annual cash incentives in the 2018 fiscal year were determined by performance against goals: under the Management Performance Incentive Plan ("MPIP") for the purpose of determining the final annual incentive payouts, and under the Cash Incentive Plan ("CIP") for the purpose of achieving tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) as in effect prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See "Compensation Discussion & Analysis — Tax Deductibility of Compensation" for a discussion of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the Company's compensation program.  This annual incentive is designed to link executive compensation directly to the Company's performance by providing incentives and rewards based upon business performance during the applicable fiscal year, while preserving the tax deductibility of awards under Section 162(m) where possible. 
Target Award Opportunities 
Each employee eligible for an annual incentive award is assigned a target award equal to a percentage of that employee's base salary earned during the applicable fiscal year. Target annual incentive opportunities are based upon the applicable employee's position, grade level, responsibilities, and historical and expected future contributions to the Company. In addition, each employment agreement between the Company and each of the NEOs contains a minimum target annual incentive award level. See "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" below. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion and subject to the terms of employment agreements, may revise target annual incentive award levels for the executive officers. 
Annual Incentive Payouts 
The below table summarizes each NEO's target annual incentive opportunity and actual 2018 fiscal year annual incentive payouts, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Consistent with prior years' practice, payouts earned under the CIP were reduced so that actual 2018 fiscal year annual incentive payouts were in line with calculated payouts under the MPIP. The annual incentive payouts are described in more detail below.

MPIP 
Overview 
MPIP awards to all eligible employees are conditioned upon the satisfaction of predetermined financial and strategic objectives, weighted at 75% and 25%, respectively. Final MPIP results are calculated based on performance achievement against these predetermined goals.  Performance Targets & Achievement Levels 
Financial Component (75%): For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the MPIP financial performance objectives included rigorous Total Company Net Revenue and Company AOI 
 targets, with potential payouts under this component ranging from 0-200% of target. The level of payout is determined based on the extent to which the Company's annual financial performance exceeded or missed the predetermined targets, as outlined below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Company AOI (60%)       123.8% of target   
 Company AOI (60%)       123.8% of target   
[END TABLE]
Strategic Component (25%): For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the MPIP also included a performance component that measures achievement against strategic objectives set at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
The Company has 11 business units/functions (e.g., Marketing Partnerships, Venue Operations, Corporate) and each such business unit/function, including Corporate, establishes up to five strategic goals with up to ten discrete metrics under each individual goal, which are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The strategic goals for each division are assigned a weight at the beginning of the year and the level of achievement of each goal is evaluated on a four-point scale. The strategic component for NEO payouts is calculated based on the extent to which Corporate-specific objectives are achieved or missed in the fiscal year. 
Based on the Company's performance against the predetermined metrics established under each of the five Corporate strategic goals, the payout result of the strategic component of the MPIP was achieved at 157.5% of target. 
MPIP Payout: As a result of the level of achievement of the Corporate financial and strategic objectives, as discussed above, MPIP paid out at 130.0% of the target level. 
CIP 
Overview 
While the MPIP is used to determine annual incentive amounts, NEOs and executive officers receive annual incentive awards under the CIP to preserve tax deductibility where possible. 
Performance Targets & Achievement Levels 
For the 2018 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee used Business Unit AOI as the financial measure for CIP funding, with no awards payable under the plan if a Business Unit AOI threshold of $120.0 million was not achieved. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Business Unit AOI was $266.6 million, and the CIP bonus pool was funded. The Compensation Committee used negative discretion to bring CIP payout levels to the same level as payouts calculated under the MPIP (i.e., 130.0% of the target level). 
Long-term Incentives 
Long-term incentives represent a substantial portion of our executive officers' annual total direct compensation. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, long-term incentives were comprised of performance stock units and restricted stock units. 
The Compensation Committee believes this equity mix:  The following table summarizes our 2018 fiscal year long-term incentive awards for all NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Restricted Stock Units      50%   ✓    Share-based award establishes direct alignment with our stock price performance and stockholder interests 
 Restricted Stock Units      50%   ✓    Share-based award establishes direct alignment with our stock price performance and stockholder interests 
[END TABLE]
Additional information regarding long-term incentive awards granted to NEOs during the 2018 fiscal year is set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Effective September 1, 2018, the target annual long-term incentive opportunities of Messrs. Lustgarten and Burian were increased to $3,000,000 and $1,400,000, respectively. Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, Mr. Dolan's target annual long-term incentive opportunity was increased to $9,000,000. Additionally, in recognition of Mr. Dolan's service as Chief Executive Officer for seven months of the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Dolan received a make-whole award with a target value of $875,000 and in connection with the execution of Mr. Dolan's employment agreement, Mr. Dolan received a one-time award of performance stock units and stock options. For more information regarding these awards, see "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements." These increases reflect each of Messrs. Dolan, Lustgarten and Burian's role and performance, as well as his competitive market positioning and internal considerations. 
Performance Stock Units 
Performance stock units are intended to align the executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders, with a focus on long-term financial results. Under our executive compensation program for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, performance stock units were granted to executive officers and certain other members of management pursuant to the 2015 Employee Stock Plan (the "Employee Stock Plan"). With respect to NEOs, the performance stock units also were designed to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) where possible.  2018 Fiscal Year Grants 
In August 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following awards of performance stock units to the NEOs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance period):

Performance stock units are structured to be paid at the end of a three-year performance period, to the extent the applicable pre-determined financial performance goals are met. 
Target Setting 
For the 2018 fiscal year performance stock units granted in September 2017 for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance period, the Compensation Committee selected Total Company Net Revenue and Business Unit AOI as the two financial metrics. Goals were set at the beginning of the fiscal year based on the Company's five-year strategic plan, which is subject to review by the Board in connection with its approval of the annual budget. The Company's five-year strategic plan is confidential and disclosure of those targets could provide information that could lead to competitive harm, and for this reason the three-year performance stock unit financial performance targets are not disclosed; however, the Compensation Committee seeks to make target goals ambitious, requiring meaningful growth over the performance period, while threshold goals are expected to be achievable. The Company intends to disclose the Total Company Net Revenue and Business Unit AOI payout results as a percentage of target as well as the resulting payout for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance stock units as a percentage of target after the end of the performance period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial  Metrics (Weighting)     Threshold Performance     Maximum Performance 
 Financial  Metrics (Weighting)     Threshold Performance     Maximum Performance 
 Total Company Net Revenue (50%)    85% of target goal    115% of target goal 
 Total Company Net Revenue (50%)    85% of target goal    115% of target goal 
 Business Unit AOI (50%)    75% of target goal    125% of target goal 
[END TABLE]
 The performance stock unit payout opportunity ranges from 0 to 110% of target, based on performance and subject to continued employment. At the threshold performance level, 90% of target performance stock units would pay out, and at or above the maximum performance level, 110% of target performance stock units would pay out. If the Company exceeds threshold levels but does not achieve the targeted rates, or if the Company achieves or exceeds one target but not both, the award provides for partial payments. No performance stock units pay out if the Company fails to achieve both threshold levels of performance. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted stock units serve to align executive officers' interests with those of stockholders and promote the retention of employees, including the NEOs. 
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following awards of restricted stock units to the NEOs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock Plan:

Restricted stock units vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant subject to continued employment and include a performance threshold designed to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) for eligible NEOs. 
For 2018 fiscal year restricted stock units, the Section 162(m) performance objectives required the Business Unit AOI in any of the fiscal years ending on June 30, 2018, June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2020 to exceed 60% of the 2017 fiscal year Business Unit AOI. 
On August 29, 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the achievement of the performance objectives for the awards held by executive officers, based on Business Unit AOI for the 2018 fiscal year ($266.6 million) exceeding 60% of the Business Unit AOI for the 2017 fiscal year ($120.0 million). 
Stock Options 
Stock options establish a close alignment with stock price performance and with our stockholders' interests. In connection with Mr. Lustgarten's promotion to President of the Company, in December 2017 the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the compensation   consultant, awarded Mr. Lustgarten a one-time grant of stock options to purchase 93,826 shares of the Class A Common Stock with an option exercise price equal to $210.13 per share (the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant). The aggregate grant date fair value of this award is $5,000,000. The one-time option award vests in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the effective date of Mr. Lustgarten's employment agreement, subject to continued employment. 
2016 Fiscal Year Performance Stock Unit Awards 
As previously disclosed, the compensation committee of MSG Networks approved awards of MSG Networks performance stock units for certain of our NEOs for the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2016, which were converted into Company awards in connection with the MSG Distribution. Additionally, our Compensation Committee awarded certain other NEOs performance stock units shortly following the MSG Distribution. 
In light of the Company's business and management restructuring following the MSG Distribution, the Company determined to modify the 2016 fiscal year performance stock units into restricted stock units that cliff vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment, and included a performance threshold designed to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) for eligible NEOs. 
The Section 162(m) performance objective was certified by the Compensation Committee in September 2016 and the awards vested in accordance with their terms on September 11, 2018. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all directors and employees (including NEOs) from (i) engaging in short sales or other "hedging" transactions and (ii) placing securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging Company securities. 
Holding Requirements 
Under our executive compensation program for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, annual restricted stock unit awards to NEOs vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and annual performance stock unit awards to NEOs cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, in each case, so long as the recipient is continuously employed by the Company until the applicable vesting date (and subject to the performance conditions described above and any applicable terms of their employment agreement). With respect to our non-management directors, and as discussed above under " — Director Compensation," compensation includes annual awards of restricted stock units. Pursuant to the award agreements, directors' restricted stock units are settled in shares of Company stock (or, in the Compensation Committee's discretion, cash) on the first business day following 90 days after service on the Board ceases (other than in the event of a director's death, where the restricted stock units are settled immediately). One effect of the cliff and three-year ratable vesting (with respect to our NEOs and eligible employees) and the holding requirements (with respect to our non-management directors) is to require each of our non-management directors, NEOs and eligible employees to maintain significant holdings of Company securities at all times. 
BENEFITS 
Benefits offered to executive officers generally provide for retirement income and serve as a safety net against hardships that can arise from illness, disability or death. The executive officers are generally eligible to participate in the same health and welfare benefit plans made available to   the other benefits-eligible employees of the Company, including, for example, medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage. 
Defined Benefit Plans 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company assumed from MSG Networks sponsorship of the MSG Holdings, L.P. Cash Balance Pension Plan, which was renamed the MSG Sports & Entertainment, LLC Cash Balance Pension Plan (the "Cash Balance Pension Plan"), a tax-qualified defined benefit plan, for participating employees, including executive officers. Effective March 1, 2011, MSG Networks merged the Madison Square Garden, L.P. Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), a frozen defined benefit pension plan, into the Cash Balance Pension Plan. Under the MSG Sports & Entertainment, LLC Excess Cash Balance Plan (the "Excess Cash Balance Plan"), a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, the Company provides additional benefits to employees, including executive officers, who are restricted by the applicable IRS annual compensation limitation. Each of the Cash Balance Pension Plan and Excess Cash Balance Plan were frozen to new participants and future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015. 
More information regarding the Cash Balance Pension Plan, the Excess Cash Balance Plan, and the Retirement Plan is provided in the Pension Benefits table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Defined Contribution Plans 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company assumed from MSG Networks the sponsorship of the MSG Holdings, L.P. 401(k) Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"), a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, for participating employees, including executive officers. As of the MSG Distribution, the Savings Plan was renamed the Madison Square Garden 401(k) Savings Plan, and amended to be a multiple employer plan to which MSG Networks also contributes as a participating employer. Under the Savings Plan, participants may contribute into their plan accounts a percentage of their eligible pay on a before-tax basis as well as a percentage of their eligible pay on an after-tax basis. The Savings Plan provides (a) fully-vested matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) a discretionary non-elective contribution by the Company. In March 2018, the Company provided a discretionary non-elective contribution with regards to the 2017 calendar year equal to 1.5% of eligible pay. 
In addition, the Company offers the MSG Sports & Entertainment, LLC Excess Savings Plan (the "Excess Savings Plan"), a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, to employees, including executive officers, who are restricted by the applicable IRS annual compensation limitation and/or the pre-tax income deferral limitation. More information regarding the Excess Savings Plan is provided in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Matching contributions made by the Company under the Savings Plan and the Excess Savings Plan are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
PERQUISITES 
The Company provides certain perquisites to executive officers as described below. Additional information concerning perquisites received by each of the NEOs is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Car and Driver 
Messrs. Dolan and Lustgarten have (and, prior to his departure, Mr. O'Connor had) regular access to a car and driver which each is permitted to use for personal use in addition to business purposes.   For Mr. Dolan a portion of such costs are reimbursed by MSG Networks. In addition, certain other executive officers and members of management have access to cars and drivers on a limited basis for personal use. To the extent employees used a car and driver for personal use without reimbursement to the Company, those employees are imputed compensation for tax purposes. 
Aircraft Arrangements 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Company owned its own airplane, and also had access to various aircraft through arrangements with various Dolan family entities. Messrs. Dolan and Lustgarten have (and, prior to his departure, Mr. O'Connor had) been permitted to use the Company's aircraft as well as aircraft of various Dolan family entities for personal use. Additionally, Messrs. Dolan and Lustgarten have access to helicopter travel for personal travel, which has primarily been for purposes of commutation. The Company and MSG Networks have agreed on an allocation of the costs of such personal helicopter use with respect to Mr. Dolan. See "Transactions with Related Parties — Aircraft Arrangements." 
The Company is typically reimbursed for the incremental costs associated with the personal use of aircraft (other than for commutation). To the extent any executive officer or other employee uses any of the aircraft, including helicopters, for personal travel without reimbursement to the Company, they are imputed compensation for tax purposes based on the Standard Industry Fare 
 Level rates that are published biannually by the IRS. For compensation reporting purposes, we valued the incremental cost of the personal use of the aircraft based on the variable costs incurred by the Company net of any reimbursements received from executive officers. The incremental cost of the use of the aircraft does not include any costs that would have been incurred by the Company whether or not the personal trip was taken. 
Executive Security 
Mr. Dolan participates in the Company's executive security program. The Company and MSG Networks agreed on an allocation of the costs of such participation in their security program. See "Transactions with Related Parties." Because certain of these costs can be viewed as conveying personal benefits to Mr. Dolan, they are reported as perquisites. 
Other 
From time to time certain employees, including the NEOs (and their guests), have access to tickets to sporting events and other entertainment at the Company's venues at no cost, and may also purchase tickets at face value. Attendance at such events is integrally and directly related to the performance of their duties, and, as such, we do not deem the receipt of such tickets to be perquisites. 
Our NEOs may also make incidental use from time to time of medical and other health related services provided by the Company's staff. 
POST-TERMINATION COMPENSATION 
We believe that post-termination benefits are integral to the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers. 
Under certain circumstances, payments or other benefits may be provided to employees upon the termination of their employment with the Company. These may include payments or other benefits upon a termination by the Company without cause, termination by the employee for good reason, other voluntary termination by the employee, retirement, death, disability, or termination following a change in control of the Company or following a going private transaction. With respect to the NEOs, the amounts and terms of such payments and other benefits (including the definition of "cause" and "good reason") are governed by each NEO's employment agreement and any applicable award   agreements. Post-termination compensation is discussed in greater detail in "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment 
 Agreements" and " — Termination and Severance" below. 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION 
For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31 2017, Section 162(m) established a $1 million limit on the amount that a publicly held corporation may deduct for compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the next three most highly paid NEOs (other than the chief financial officer) in a taxable year. This limitation does not apply to any compensation that is "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), which is defined as compensation paid in connection with certain stock options or that is paid only if the individual's performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria established under a plan approved by stockholders. Our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans have generally been designed to qualify for this exemption from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) and to be consistent with providing appropriate compensation to executive officers. The Company's stockholders approved the CIP and Employee Stock Plan at the Company's annual stockholders' meeting on December 9, 2016. 
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) was modified to remove the "qualified performance-based compensation exemption" from Section 162(m), unless such compensation is "grandfathered" because it is paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and has not been modified in any material respect on or after such date. 
OTHER AWARDS – MSG DISTRIBUTION 
Employee Restricted Stock Units 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, each holder of a MSG Networks employee restricted stock unit that was granted prior to July 1, 2015 received one MSG restricted stock unit in respect of every three MSG Networks employee restricted stock units owned on the record date (each such MSG restricted stock unit, an "MSG Distribution Unit") and, upon vesting, received a share of our Class A Common Stock (or cash or other property) for each employee restricted stock unit in accordance with the existing award agreement. In connection with the MSG Distribution, each MSG Networks employee restricted stock unit that was granted on or after July 1, 2015 (but prior to the MSG Distribution Date) was adjusted in accordance with its terms, which generally provide that (1) each holder who remained employed by MSG Networks following the MSG Distribution continued to hold the employee restricted stock units, with the number of employee restricted stock units adjusted to reflect the MSG Distribution to maintain the value of the employee restricted stock units, and (2) each holder who the Company employed following the MSG Distribution received our restricted stock units of the same value as the original MSG Networks employee restricted stock units, and the MSG Networks employee restricted stock units were cancelled. Any holder of MSG Networks employee restricted stock units granted on or after July 1, 2015 (but prior to the MSG Distribution Date) who was employed by both MSG Networks and us following the MSG Distribution (including Messrs. Dolan and Burian) continued to hold MSG Networks employee restricted stock units, adjusted to reflect the MSG Distribution, and received our restricted stock units in connection with the MSG Distribution, so that 30% of the value of the employee's restricted stock units were MSG Networks employee restricted stock units and 70% of the value of the employee's restricted stock units were our restricted stock units as of the MSG Distribution Date.  REPORT OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis set forth above with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this proxy statement for filing with the SEC.

Vincent Tese  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
The tables below reflect the compensation of the Company's NEOs. See "Compensation 
 Discussion & Analysis" for an explanation of our compensation philosophy and program. 
SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 
The table below summarizes the total compensation paid to or earned by each of our NEOs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The information set forth below with respect to the Pre-MSG Distribution Period is historical MSG Networks compensation. Such historical MSG Networks information has been provided by, or derived from information provided by, MSG Networks and reflects compensation earned during the Pre-MSG Distribution Period based upon services rendered to MSG Networks and its subsidiaries. Amounts relating to the MSG Pre-Distribution Period that are separately disclosed in the MSG Networks Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018, are not disclosed herein, so as to avoid double-counting. Following the MSG Distribution, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary are shared employees of the Company and MSG Networks, and therefore the information set forth below for periods following the MSG Distribution only reflects the compensation for those shared executive officers paid by the Company for services rendered to the Company, and excludes amounts for which MSG Networks reimbursed the Company (for more information regarding the compensation of Messrs. Dolan and Burian by MSG Networks, see MSG Networks' Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018). 
Effective November 2017, Mr. O'Connor ceased to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. O'Connor's 2018 fiscal year compensation is reflected herein because he was employed by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer for a portion of the year. Mr. Dolan became Chief Executive Officer effective November 2017, and Mr. Lustgarten was promoted to President of the Company in December 2017.

(2)  This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of Company restricted stock units and performance  stock units granted to the NEOs, without any reduction for risk of forfeiture, as calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the performance stock units is shown at target performance. For the  2018 figures, this column reflects the value of restricted stock units and performance stock units granted in September 2017.

[END TABLE]
 The Company maintains several benefit plans for our executive officers. The material terms and conditions are discussed below. 
Cash Balance Pension Plan 
Upon the MSG Distribution, the Company assumed from MSG Networks the sponsorship of the Cash Balance Pension Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit plan that generally covers regular full-time and part-time non-union employees of the Company and certain of its affiliates who have completed one year of service. The Cash Balance Pension Plan was frozen to future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015 (though accrued benefits continue to earn interest credits). A notional account is maintained for each participant under the Cash Balance Pension Plan, including the NEOs (other than Messrs. Dolan and O'Connor and Ms. Coleman), which consists of (i) annual allocations made by the Company as of the end of each year on behalf of each participant who has completed 800 hours of service during the year that range from 3% to 9% of the participant's compensation, based on the participant's age and (ii) monthly interest credits based on the average of the annual rate of interest on the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bonds for the months of September, October and November of the prior year. Compensation includes all direct cash compensation received while a participant as part of the participant's primary compensation structure (excluding bonuses, fringe benefits, and other compensation that is not received on a regular basis), and before deductions for elective deferrals, subject to applicable IRS limits. 
A participant's interest in the Cash Balance Pension Plan is subject to vesting limitations for the first three years of employment. A participant's account will also vest in full upon his or her termination due to death, disability or retirement after attaining age 65. Upon retirement or other termination of employment with the Company, the participant may elect a distribution of the vested portion of the cash balance account. Any amounts remaining in the Cash Balance Pension Plan will continue to be credited with interest until the account is paid. The normal form of benefit payment for an unmarried participant is a single life annuity and the normal form of benefit payment for a married participant is a 50% joint and survivor annuity. The participant, with spousal consent if applicable, can waive the normal form and elect a single life annuity or a lump sum. 
Excess Cash Balance Plan 
The Excess Cash Balance Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is intended to provide eligible participants, including each of the NEOs (other than Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Coleman), with a portion of their overall benefit that they would accrue under the Cash Balance Pension Plan but for Code limits on the amount of "compensation" (as defined in the Cash Balance Pension Plan) that can be taken into account in determining benefits under tax-qualified plans. The Excess Cash Balance Plan was frozen to future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015 (though accrued benefits continue to earn interest credits). The Company maintains a notional excess cash balance account for each eligible participant, and for each calendar year, credits these accounts with the portion of the allocation that could not be made on his or her behalf under the Cash Balance Pension Plan due to the compensation limitation. In addition, the Company credits each notional excess cash balance account monthly with interest at the same rate used under the Cash Balance Pension Plan. A participant vests in the excess cash balance account according to the same schedule in the Cash Balance Pension Plan. The excess cash balance account, to the extent vested, is paid in a lump sum to the participant as soon as practicable following his or her retirement or other termination of employment with the Company. 
Madison Square Garden 401(k) Savings Plan ("Savings Plan") 
Under the Savings Plan, a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, participating employees, including the NEOs, may contribute into their plan accounts a percentage of their eligible pay on a before-tax  basis as well as a percentage of their eligible pay on an after-tax basis. The Company provides a (a) fully-vested matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) discretionary non-elective fully-vested contribution by the Company. In March 2018, the Company made a discretionary non-elective contribution to each eligible employee's account equal to 1.5% of eligible pay with respect to the 2017 calendar year. In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Savings Plan became a multiple employer plan sponsored by the Company, to which MSG Networks also contributes for its employees. 
Excess Savings Plan 
The Excess Savings Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that operates in conjunction with the Company's tax-qualified Savings Plan. An employee is eligible to participate in the Excess Plan for a calendar year if his or her compensation (as defined in the Savings Plan) in the preceding year exceeded (or would have exceeded, if the employee had been employed for the entire year) the IRS limit on the amount of compensation that can be taken into account in determining contributions under tax-qualified retirement plans ($275,000 in calendar year 2018) and he or she makes an election to participate prior to the beginning of the year. An eligible employee whose contributions to the Savings Plan are limited as a result of this compensation limit or as a result of reaching the maximum 401(k) deferral limit ($18,500, or $24,500 if 50 or over, for calendar year 2018) can continue to make pre-tax contributions under the Excess Savings Plan of up to 4% of his or her eligible pay. In addition, the Company provides a (a) fully-vested matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) discretionary non-elective fully-vested contribution by the Company. Account balances under the Excess Savings Plan are credited monthly with the rate of return earned by the Stable Value Fund offered as an investment alternative under the Savings Plan. Distributions of vested benefits are made in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the participant's termination of employment with the Company. In March 2018, the Company made a discretionary non-elective contribution to each eligible employee's account equal to 1.5% of eligible pay with respect to the 2017 calendar year.

 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
Each of our NEOs had an employment agreement with the Company in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. On December 15, 2017, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Lustgarten in connection with his promotion to President of the Company. In addition, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with each of Mr. Burian, effective September 1, 2018, and Mr. Dolan, effective October 3, 2018, which replaces his prior agreement. Set forth below is a description of the employment agreements between the Company and each of Messrs. Dolan and Lustgarten, Ms. Coleman, and Messrs. Burian, Yospe and O'Connor. 
As noted above in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, each of Messrs. Dolan and Burian also serves as an executive officer and employee of MSG Networks. Such MSG Networks employment arrangements are pursuant to employment arrangements between MSG Networks and each of Messrs. Dolan and Burian, as applicable (which are not described herein). For a description of each of these employment agreements, see MSG Networks' Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018. 
James L. Dolan 
On September 16, 2016, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with James L. Dolan, effective as of July 1, 2016, which provides for Mr. Dolan's continued employment as the Executive Chairman of the Company. 
The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of not less than $1,000,000. Mr. Dolan is eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual bonus program with an annual target bonus opportunity equal to not less than 200% of his base salary. Mr. Dolan is eligible for our standard benefits program. He is also eligible, subject to his continued employment by the Company, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an aggregate target value of not less than $7,500,000. 
If, on or prior to December 31, 2019, Mr. Dolan's employment is either involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or is terminated by Mr. Dolan for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist (a "Qualifying Termination"), then, subject to Mr. Dolan's execution of a separation agreement, the Company will provide him with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Mr. Dolan's annual base salary and annual target bonus, (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred, (c) each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested long-term cash awards will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Mr. Dolan to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment, (d) all of the time-based restrictions on each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units (including restricted stock units subject to performance criteria) will immediately be eliminated and such restricted stock and restricted stock units will be payable or deliverable to Mr. Dolan subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria, and (e) each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested stock options and stock appreciation awards will immediately vest. 
If Mr. Dolan's employment is terminated due to his death or disability, or if after December 31, 2019 there is a Qualifying Termination, then, subject to execution of a separation agreement (other than in the case of death), he or his estate or beneficiary will be provided with the benefits and rights set forth in clauses (c), (d) and (e) above.  The employment agreement recognizes that Mr. Dolan will be employed by MSG Networks during his employment with the Company. If Mr. Dolan's employment with MSG Networks is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in Mr. Dolan's employment agreement with MSG Networks) prior to December 31, 2019, and while Mr. Dolan remains employed by the Company, then the Compensation Committee may either (1) increase Mr. Dolan's target annual compensation (consisting of his annual base salary, target annual bonus percentage and minimum annual target long-term incentive value) to equal the aggregate target annual compensation to which Mr. Dolan was entitled from the Company and from MSG Networks at the time of such MSG Networks termination, or (2) elect not to increase Mr. Dolan's target annual compensation, in which case Mr. Dolan will have good reason to resign his employment within 20 days following the Compensation Committee's election, and receive the MSG Networks Severance Amount (as defined below) in addition to the severance payments and benefits described in the preceding paragraph. If the Compensation Committee elects to increase Mr. Dolan's compensation pursuant to clause (1) above, then his target annual compensation may be increased up to a maximum annual base salary of $2,000,000, annual bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary and annual target long-term incentive of $13,500,000. We refer to the amount of this increase as the "incremental compensation." Mr. Dolan will not receive a cash severance payment from MSG Networks (the "MSG Networks Severance Amount") on such a termination, which amount will instead be paid by MSG Networks to the Company. Additionally, if, following an MSG Networks termination, Mr. Dolan's employment with the Company is terminated after December 31, 2019, without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, then Mr. Dolan will be entitled to an additional severance payment from the Company equal to the MSG Networks Severance Amount less the aggregate incremental compensation paid or awarded to Mr. Dolan by the Company after the MSG Networks termination. The employment agreement also provides that certain actions and circumstances arising from or relating to Mr. Dolan's dual employment with MSG Networks will not be deemed to be a breach of his obligations under the employment agreement or to constitute cause. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Dolan, including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. Dolan's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company. 
The Company and Mr. Dolan entered into a new employment agreement effective October 3, 2018, which provides for Mr. Dolan's continued employment as the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The new employment agreement supersedes and replaces his prior agreement. The terms of the new employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Mr. Dolan's prior employment agreement, provided that beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, it is expected that Mr. Dolan will receive annual grants of cash and/or equity long-term incentive awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $9,000,000 as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
Additionally, in recognition of Mr. Dolan's service as Chief Executive Officer for seven months of the Company's fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Dolan received a make-whole award with a target value of $875,000 (the "FY 2018 Award"). The FY 2018 Award is comprised of 50% restricted stock units, two-thirds of which vest on August 30, 2019 and the remainder of which vest on August 30, 2020, and 50% performance stock units, which vest on the same schedule (and subject to the same performance targets) as the performance stock units previously granted to Mr. Dolan with respect to that fiscal year.  Promptly following the execution of the new employment agreement, the Company also granted Mr. Dolan a one-time special award of (x) performance stock units with an aggregate grant date fair value of $10,000,000 (the "Special PSU Grant") and (y) three grants of stock options, each with a grant date fair value of $10,000,000 (the "Option Grants"). Subject to the terms of the award agreement, 75% of the Special PSU Grant will vest at the same time as the performance stock units previously granted to Mr. Dolan with respect to the Company's current fiscal year ending on June 30, 2019, and the remaining 25% will vest on September 15, 2022, in each case subject to the same performance targets as the performance stock units previously granted to Mr. Dolan with respect to the Company's current fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. The three Option Grants have exercise prices as follows: one equals the grant date closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock, one equals 110% of the grant date closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock and one equals 125% of the grant date closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Each of the Option Grants will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on September 15, 2019, subject to the terms of the award agreements, and expire not later than 7.5 years after the date of grant. 
The new agreement with Mr. Dolan expires on December 31, 2023. 
Andrew Lustgarten 
Effective December 15, 2017 (the "Lustgarten Effective Date"), the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lustgarten in connection with Mr. Lustgarten's appointment as President of the Company. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of not less than $1,000,000 (subject to annual review and increase in the discretion of our Compensation Committee) and an annual target bonus equal to not less than 150% of Mr. Lustgarten's annual base salary. Mr. Lustgarten will also participate in future long-
 term incentive programs that are made available to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to Mr. Lustgarten's continued employment by the Company. Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018, and each fiscal year thereafter, it is expected that Mr. Lustgarten will receive one or more long-term awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $2,000,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Lustgarten's target long-term opportunity was prorated to reflect the period from the Lustgarten Effective Date through June 30, 2018. 
In connection with the execution of the employment agreement, Mr. Lustgarten received a one-time grant of stock options with an aggregate grant date fair value equal to $5,000,000 (the "Option Grant"). The Option Grant vests in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the Lustgarten Effective Date, and expires no later than 10 years after the date of grant. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Lustgarten continues to be eligible to participate in the Company's standard benefits program, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements, payment of required premiums, and the terms of the plans. 
If Mr. Lustgarten's employment with the Company is terminated on or prior to December 31, 2021 (i) by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the employment agreement), or (ii) by Mr. Lustgarten for "good reason" (as defined in the employment agreement) and cause does not then exist, then, subject to Mr. Lustgarten's execution of a separation agreement with the Company, the Company will provide him with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Mr. Lustgarten's annual base salary and annual target bonus; (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred; (c) each of Mr. Lustgarten's   outstanding long-term cash awards will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Mr. Lustgarten to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment; (d) all of the time-based restrictions on each of Mr. Lustgarten's outstanding restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to him under the plans of the Company will immediately be eliminated and will be payable or deliverable to Mr. Lustgarten subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria; and (e) each of Mr. Lustgarten's outstanding stock options and stock appreciation awards under the plans of the Company will immediately vest. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Lustgarten including a non-competition agreement that restricts Mr. Lustgarten's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company on or prior to December 31, 2021. 
Donna Coleman 
The Company entered into an employment agreement with Donna Coleman effective as of October 16, 2015, which provides for her employment as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company at an annual base salary of not less than $900,000 (subject to annual review and increase in the discretion of our Compensation Committee) and an annual target bonus equal to not less than 150% of her annual base salary in the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Ms. Coleman will also participate in future long-term incentive programs that are made available to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to Ms. Coleman's continued employment by the Company. Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and each fiscal year thereafter, it is expected that Ms. Coleman will receive one or more long-term awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $2,000,000. Under the agreement, Ms. Coleman is eligible to participate in the Company's standard benefits program, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements, payment of required premiums, and the terms of the plans. 
If, on or prior to October 1, 2018, Ms. Coleman's employment with the Company is terminated (i) by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or (ii) by Ms. Coleman for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist, then, subject to Ms. Coleman's execution of a separation agreement with the Company, the Company will provide her with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Ms. Coleman's annual base salary and annual target bonus; (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred; (c) each of Ms. Coleman's outstanding long-term cash awards will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Ms. Coleman to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment; (d) all of the time-based restrictions on each of Ms. Coleman's outstanding restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to her under the plans of the Company will immediately be eliminated and will be payable or deliverable to Ms. Coleman subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria; and (e) each of Ms. Coleman's outstanding stock options and stock appreciation awards under the plans of the Company will immediately vest. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Ms. Coleman including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Ms. Coleman's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of her employment with the Company. 
Lawrence J. Burian 
On September 11, 2015, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Lawrence J. Burian, which became effective as of the MSG   Distribution Date. As noted above, Mr. Burian's MSG Networks employment arrangement is pursuant to a separate written employment agreement with MSG Networks (for more information regarding Mr. Burian's employment arrangement with MSG Networks, see MSG Networks' Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018). The employment agreement with the Company provides for Mr. Burian's employment as the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. The employment agreement provides for a minimum annual base salary of not less than $700,000 and a discretionary annual bonus with a target value equal to not less than 150% of Mr. Burian's annual base salary. Mr. Burian will also participate in future long-term incentive programs that are made available to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to Mr. Burian's continued employment by the Company. It is expected that Mr. Burian will receive one or more long-term awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $1,050,000. Mr. Burian will be eligible to participate in the Company's standard benefits program, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements, payment of required premiums, and the terms of the plans. 
If Mr. Burian's employment with the Company is terminated on or prior to October 1, 2019 (the "Burian Scheduled Expiration Date") (i) by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or (ii) by Mr. Burian for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist, then, subject to Mr. Burian's execution of a separation agreement, the Company will provide Mr. Burian with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Mr. Burian's annual base salary and annual target bonus; (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred; (c) each of Mr. Burian's outstanding long-term cash awards will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Mr. Burian to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment; (d) all of the time-based restrictions on each of Mr. Burian's outstanding restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to him under the plans of the Company will immediately be eliminated and will be payable to or deliverable to Mr. Burian subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria; and (e) each of Mr. Burian's outstanding stock options under the plans of the Company will immediately vest. 
If Mr. Burian ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date as a result of his death or disability, and at such time cause does not exist, then, subject to execution of a separation agreement (other than in the case of death), he or his estate or beneficiary will be provided with the benefits and rights set forth in (b), (d) and (e) of the preceding paragraph and each of his outstanding long-term cash awards shall immediately vest in full, whether or not subject to performance criteria and will be payable on the 90th day after the termination of his employment; provided, that if any such award is subject to any performance criteria, then (i) if the measurement period for such performance criteria has not yet been fully completed, the payment amount will be at the target amount for such award, and (ii) if the measurement period for such performance criteria has already been fully completed, the payment amount of such award will be at the same time and to the same extent that other similarly situated executives receive payment as determined by the Compensation Committee (subject to the satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Burian will not be entitled to the severance payment described in (a) of the second preceding paragraph if Mr. Burian's employment with the Company is terminated without cause or for good reason (other than if cause then exists) prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and while Mr. Burian remains employed with MSG   Networks. If Mr. Burian's employment with MSG Networks is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in Mr. Burian's employment agreement with MSG Networks) prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and while Mr. Burian remains employed by the Company, then Mr. Burian's target annual compensation (consisting of his annual base salary, target annual bonus percentage and minimum annual target long-term incentive value) will increase to equal the aggregate target annual compensation to which Mr. Burian was entitled from the Company and from MSG Networks at the time of such MSG Networks termination. We refer to the amount of this increase as the "incremental compensation." Mr. Burian will not receive a severance payment from MSG Networks (the "MSG Networks Severance") on such a termination, which amount will instead be paid by MSG Networks to the Company. 
Additionally, if Mr. Burian's employment from the Company is terminated after the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and after such MSG Networks termination without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, then Mr. Burian will be entitled to an additional severance payment from the Company equal to the MSG Networks Severance less the aggregate incremental compensation paid to Mr. Burian by the Company after the MSG Networks termination. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Burian including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. Burian's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company. 
The Company and Mr. Burian entered into a new employment agreement effective September 1, 2018, which supersedes and replaces his prior agreement. The terms of the new employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Mr. Burian's prior employment agreement, provided that Mr. Burian will receive a minimum annual base salary of not less than $840,000 and will be eligible, subject to his continued employment and actual grant by the Compensation Committee, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an aggregate target value of not less than $1,400,000. The new agreement with Mr. Burian expires on December 31, 2021. 
Joseph F. Yospe 
On September 6, 2016, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Joseph F. Yospe. The agreement provides for Mr. Yospe's continued employment as the Senior Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer of the Company. 
Pursuant to the employment agreement, which was effective September 1, 2016, Mr. Yospe receives an annual base salary of $502,825. He is eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual bonus program with an annual target bonus opportunity equal to 45% of his base salary. Bonus payments are based on actual salary paid during the year for which they are awarded. Mr. Yospe is eligible for our standard benefits program. He is also eligible, subject to his continued employment by the Company and actual grant by the Compensation Committee, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an expected aggregate target value of not less than $460,000. Any such awards are subject to actual grant by the Compensation Committee, and are pursuant to the applicable plan document and the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. 
If, prior to September 1, 2019, his employment is either involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or is terminated by Mr. Yospe for   "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist, the Company is obligated to provide him with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than the sum of Mr. Yospe's annual base salary and annual target bonus and (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred. Payment of any such amounts is subject to Mr. Yospe's execution of a severance agreement including a release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Yospe including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. Yospe's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company; provided that the noncompetition covenant will not apply following a termination of Mr. Yospe's employment either by the Company other than for cause or by Mr. Yospe for good reason (if cause does not then exist) if Mr. Yospe waives his entitlement to the severance benefits described above. 
David O'Connor 
In connection with the MSG Distribution and Mr. O'Connor's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. O'Connor's employment agreement with MSG Networks dated June 29, 2015 was assigned to the Company. The term of the employment agreement commenced on July 15, 2015 (the "Effective Date"). The employment agreement provided for an annual base salary of not less than $2,000,000 and, commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, an annual target bonus equal to not less than 200% of Mr. O'Connor's annual base salary. Mr. O'Connor was also eligible to participate in future long-term incentive programs that were made available to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to Mr. O'Connor's continued employment by the Company. Commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015, and each fiscal year thereafter, it was expected that Mr. O'Connor would receive one or more long-term awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $9,000,000. 
Effective November 2017, Mr. O'Connor ceased to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer and left the Company. 
In connection with the execution of his employment agreement, Mr. O'Connor received a one-time grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate grant date value equal to $40,000,000, determined based on the average closing price of a share of MSG Networks Class A Common Stock for the 20 trading days prior to, but not including, the Effective Date. In connection with the MSG Distribution, this one-time grant was cancelled and replaced in October 2015 with a grant of Company restricted stock units with a then-equivalent value (the "Make-Whole Grant"). The Make-Whole Grant value was scheduled to cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the Effective Date subject to the achievement of performance objectives established by the Compensation Committee. Under the agreement, Mr. O'Connor was eligible to participate in the Company's standard benefits program, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements, payment of required premiums, and the terms of the plans. 
If Mr. O'Connor's employment with the Company was terminated prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date (i) by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or (ii) by Mr. O'Connor for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause did not then exist, then, subject to Mr. O'Connor's execution of a separation agreement with the Company, the Make-Whole Grant will vest and be delivered (or if the performance conditions applicable to the Make-Whole Grant have not been satisfied, the Make-Whole Grant will be delivered promptly after the performance conditions have been satisfied).  Mr. O'Connor's termination of employment was treated as an event qualifying for the full vesting of the Make Whole Grant. 
The employment agreement contained certain covenants by Mr. O'Connor including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. O'Connor's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of the termination of his employment with the Company. 
TERMINATION AND SEVERANCE 
This section describes the payments that would be received by our NEOs who were employed by the Company as of June 30, 2018 upon various terminations of employment scenarios. The information under "Separation from the Company" assumes that each NEO was employed by the Company under his or her applicable employment agreement, and his or her employment terminated as of June 30, 2018. This information is presented to illustrate the payments such NEOs would have received from the Company under the various termination scenarios. 
Separation from the Company 
Payments may be made to NEOs upon the termination of their employment with the Company depending upon the circumstances of their termination, which include termination by the Company without cause, termination by the Company with cause, termination by the NEO for good reason, other voluntary termination by the NEO, retirement, death, disability, or termination following a change in control of the Company or following a going private transaction. Certain of these circumstances are addressed in the employment agreements between the Company and each NEO. For a description of termination provisions in the employment agreements, see "— Employment Agreements" above. In addition, award agreements for long-term incentives also address some of these circumstances. 
Quantification of Termination and Severance 
The following tables set forth a quantification of estimated severance and other benefits payable to the NEOs who were employed by the Company as of June 30, 2018 under various circumstances regarding the termination of their employment. In calculating these severance and other payments, we have taken into consideration or otherwise assumed the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event of termination of employment, the payment of certain long-term incentive awards and other amounts  may be delayed, depending upon the terms of each specific award agreement, the provisions of the applicable NEO's employment agreement and the applicability of Code Section 409A. In quantifying aggregate termination payments,

 CEO PAY RATIO 
We are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the total compensation of Mr. James L. Dolan, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as of June 30, 2018, pursuant to the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K ("Item 402"). The pay ratio is calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules. 
To identify our median employee, we first determined our employee population as of June 30, 2018, which consisted of employees located in the U.S. and internationally, representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees employed by the Company on that date. Using information from our payroll records, we then measured each employee's annual total compensation, consisting of base salary, overtime payments, short and long-term incentives, and sales incentives. For non-U.S. employees paid in local currency, the total annual compensation was translated to U.S. dollars using published exchange rates as of June 30, 2018, and total compensation for full-time employees who were employed for less than the full fiscal year (i.e., full-time employees who were hired during the course of the 2018 fiscal year) was annualized. The Company did not otherwise make any adjustments under Item 402. 
Once we identified the median employee, we then determined that employee's total compensation, including any perquisites and other benefits, in the same manner that we determined the total compensation of our NEOs for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table above. 
Given the nature of our businesses, more than half of our employee population consists of part-time, seasonal and temporary employees who work in our venues (e.g., custodial workers and ticket takers), or work in connection with a specific team or production that is not in operation for a full year. These employees, by the nature of their limited hours worked during the year, have relatively low total compensation when compared to full-time employees. Item 402 does not permit annualized or full-time equivalent adjustments to the compensation of these individuals when identifying our median employee or calculating the pay ratio. 
Using these guidelines, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer had annual total compensation of $11,591,240 and the median-compensated employee, a part-time temporary laborer at the Forum, had an annual total compensation of $18,581. The resulting ratio was 624:1. 
Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio provided above may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratio.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, MSG NETWORKS AND AMC NETWORKS 
As a result of the MSG Distribution, MSG Networks no longer holds a common stock ownership interest in the Company. However, the Company, MSG Networks and AMC Networks are all under the control of members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities. In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company and MSG Networks and AMC Networks entered into the agreements described in this section. Certain of the agreements summarized in this section are included as exhibits to our 2018 Form 10-K, and the following summaries of those agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements as filed. Additional information concerning the arrangements between us and each of MSG Networks and AMC Networks is set forth in Note 15 to our financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. 
Distribution Agreement 
On September 11, 2015, we entered into the Distribution Agreement with MSG Networks (the "Distribution Agreement") in connection with the MSG Distribution. 
Under the Distribution Agreement, MSG Networks provided us with indemnities with respect to liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of any of (i) MSG Networks' business (other than businesses of ours); (ii) certain identified claims or proceedings; (iii) any breach by MSG Networks of its obligations under the Distribution Agreement; (iv) any untrue statement   or omission in the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC (the "Registration Statement") or in the related Information Statement (the "Information Statement") relating to MSG Networks and its subsidiaries; and (v) indemnification obligations we may have to the NBA, the NHL or the WNBA that result from acts or omissions of MSG Networks and its subsidiaries. We provided MSG Networks with indemnities with respect to liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of any of (i) the Company's businesses; (ii) any breach by us of our obligations under the Distribution Agreement; (iii) any untrue statement or omission in the Registration Statement or Information Statement other than any such statement or omission relating to MSG Networks and its subsidiaries. 
In the Distribution Agreement, we released MSG Networks from any claims we might have arising out of: 
Additionally, in the Distribution Agreement MSG Networks released us from any claims MSG Networks might have arising out of: 
The Distribution Agreement also provides for access to records and information, cooperation in defending litigation, and methods of resolution for certain disputes. 
Tax Disaffiliation Agreement 
On September 11, 2015, we entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with MSG Networks (the "Tax Disaffiliation Agreement") that governs MSG Networks' and our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters following the MSG Distribution. References in this summary description of the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement to the terms "tax" or "taxes" mean taxes as well as any interest, penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts in respect of such taxes. 
The Company and our eligible subsidiaries previously joined with MSG Networks in the filing of certain consolidated, combined and unitary returns for state, local and other applicable tax purposes. However, for periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the MSG Distribution, we generally do not join with MSG Networks in the filing of any federal, state, local or other applicable consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns. 
Under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, with certain exceptions, MSG Networks is generally responsible for all of our U.S. federal, state, local and other applicable income taxes for any taxable period or portion of such period ending on or before the MSG Distribution Date. We are generally responsible for all taxes that are attributable to us or one of our subsidiaries after the MSG Distribution Date. 
For any tax year, we are generally responsible for filing all separate company tax returns that relate   to us or one of our subsidiaries and that do not also include MSG Networks or any of its subsidiaries. MSG Networks is generally responsible for filing all separate company tax returns that relate to MSG Networks or its subsidiaries (other than tax returns that will be filed by us), and for filing consolidated, combined or unitary returns that include (i) one or more of the Company and our subsidiaries and (ii) one or more of MSG Networks and its subsidiaries. Where possible, we have waived the right to carry back any losses, credits or similar items to periods ending prior to or on the MSG Distribution Date; however, if we cannot waive the right, we are entitled to receive the resulting refund or credit, net of any taxes incurred by MSG Networks with respect to the refund or credit. 
Generally, we have the authority to conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits, relating to taxes or any adjustment to taxes for which we are responsible for filing a return under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, and MSG Networks has the authority to conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits, relating to taxes or any adjustment to taxes for which MSG Networks is responsible for filing a return under the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement. However, if one party acknowledges a liability to indemnify the other party for a tax to which such proceeding relates, and provides evidence to the other party of its ability to make such payment, the first-mentioned party has the authority to conduct such proceeding. The Tax Disaffiliation Agreement further provides for cooperation between MSG Networks and the Company with respect to tax matters, the exchange of information and the retention of records that may affect the tax liabilities of the parties to the agreement. 
Finally, the Tax Disaffiliation Agreement requires that none of the Company, MSG Networks or any of their respective subsidiaries take, or fail to take, any action where such action, or failure to act, would be inconsistent with or preclude the MSG Distribution from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to MSG Networks and to its stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, or would otherwise cause holders of MSG Networks stock that received our stock in the MSG Distribution to be taxed as a result of the MSG Distribution and certain transactions undertaken in connection with the MSG Distribution. Additionally, for the two-year period following the MSG Distribution, the Company and MSG Networks could not engage in certain activities that might jeopardize the tax-free treatment of the MSG Distribution, unless the Company or MSG Networks, as applicable, received consent from the other party or otherwise obtained a ruling from the IRS or a legal opinion, in either case reasonably satisfactory to such other party, that the activity would not alter the tax-free status of the MSG Distribution to the other party and its stockholders. Such restricted activities included: 
Moreover, each party must indemnify the other party and its subsidiaries, officers and directors for any taxes resulting from action or failure to act, if such action or failure to act precludes the MSG Distribution from qualifying as a tax-free  transaction (including taxes imposed as a result of a violation of the restrictions set forth above). 
Services Agreement 
Effective July 1, 2017, we and MSG Networks entered into a Services Agreement under which we provide certain management and other services to MSG Networks, including with respect to such areas as information technology, accounts payable, payroll, tax, certain legal functions, human resources, insurance and risk management, investor relations, corporate communications, benefit plan administration and reporting, and internal audit. MSG Networks similarly provides certain services to the Company. The Company and MSG Networks, as parties receiving services under the agreement, agreed to indemnify the party providing services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the provision by such party of services under the agreement, except to the extent that such losses result from the providing party's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement. Similarly, each party providing services under the agreement agreed to indemnify the party receiving services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the indemnifying party's provision of services under the agreement if such losses result from the providing party's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement. In connection with the expiration of the Services Agreement on June 30, 2018, we entered into an interim agreement with MSG Networks, pursuant to which each party provides the other with the same services on the same terms. We expect to enter into a new services agreement this calendar year which will be retroactive to July 1, 2018. 
Employee Matters Agreement 
We have in place an Employee Matters Agreement (the "Employee Matters Agreement") with MSG Networks that allocates assets, liabilities and responsibilities with respect to certain employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and certain other related matters in connection with the MSG Distribution. Our employees continued to participate in certain of MSG Networks' health and welfare and other employee benefit plans through December 31, 2015, following which the Company established its own health and welfare and other employee benefit plans. In connection with the MSG Distribution, we assumed certain pension and retirement plans of MSG Networks. Following the MSG Distribution Date, we and MSG Networks generally each hold responsibility for our respective employees and compensation plans except for the liability for certain incentive awards held by corporate, advertising and shared employees, the liability of which is split between the Company and MSG Networks in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement. 
Media Rights Agreements 
The media rights agreements between the Company and MSG Networks covering the Knicks of the NBA and the Rangers of the NHL provide MSG Networks exclusive media rights to team games in their local markets. Each of the media rights agreements has a stated term of 20 years, with an annual rights fee in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 of $109 million for the Knicks and $32.73 million for the Rangers. The rights fee in each media rights agreement increases annually; for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the rights fee increased to $113.42 million for the Knicks and $34.06 million for the Rangers. The rights fee is also subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, including if the Company does not make available a minimum number of games in any year. MSG Networks has certain rights to match third-party offers received by the Knicks or Rangers, as the case may be, for the media rights following the term of the agreement. 
Advertising Sales Representation Agreement 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company and MSG Networks entered into an Advertising Sales Representation Agreement pursuant to which the Company has the exclusive   right and obligation, for a commission, to sell MSG Networks' advertising availabilities for an initial stated term of seven years, subject to certain termination rights, including our right to terminate if the Company and MSG Networks are no longer affiliates and MSG Networks' right to terminate if certain sales thresholds are not met unless we pay MSG Networks the shortfall. All of MSG Networks' personnel who had previously worked on advertising sales transferred to the Company. 
Equity Administration Agreement 
We have in place an Equity Administration Agreement with AMC Networks that sets forth the responsibilities and liabilities of the parties regarding vesting, exercise and forfeiture of stock options of: (i) the Company that are held by employees or former employees of AMC Networks; and (ii) AMC Networks that are held by employees or former employees of the Company. 
Other Arrangements and Agreements with MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks 
Beginning in June 2016, the Company agreed to share certain executive support costs, including office space, executive assistants, security and transportation costs, for the Company's Executive 
 Chairman with MSG Networks, and for the Vice Chairman with MSG Networks and AMC Networks. The Company's portion of such executive support expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $989,148. See "— Dolan Family Arrangements" below for a description of certain additional office sharing arrangements that include MSG Networks and AMC Networks. The Company has also entered into a number of commercial and technical arrangements and agreements with MSG Networks and its subsidiaries and AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, none of which are material to the Company. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, these included, but were not limited to, arrangements for the use of equipment, lease and use of offices and other premises, provision of transport services and vendor services, access to technology and lease of suites and sponsorship of the Company and its professional sports teams, as applicable. 
In addition, the Company and each of MSG Networks and AMC Networks are party to aircraft and remote office space arrangements described below. See "— Aircraft Arrangements" and "— Dolan Family Arrangements." 
AIRCRAFT ARRANGEMENTS 
2018 Fiscal Year Arrangements 
A subsidiary of the Company was a party to various arrangements with a subsidiary of MSG Networks, pursuant to which MSG Networks has the right to lease on a "time-sharing" basis certain aircraft. MSG Networks was required to pay us specified expenses for each flight it elects to utilize, but not exceeding the maximum amount payable under Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") rules. MSG Networks paid the Company $8,697 for use of such aircraft during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In calculating the amounts payable under the agreement, the parties allocated in good faith the treatment of any flight that is for the benefit of both companies. Additionally, the Company and MSG Networks agreed on an allocation of the costs of certain helicopter use by its shared executive officers. The Company's portion of such expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $363,026. 
A subsidiary of the Company was a party to an Aircraft Dry Lease Agreement with Quart 2C, LLC ("Q2C"), a company controlled by James. L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director, of the Company, pursuant to which Q2C had a right to lease on a non-exclusive basis our Gulfstream Aerospace G550 aircraft (the "G550"). Q2C was   required to pay us rent at an hourly rate and specified expenses for each flight it elected to utilize. Pursuant to these arrangements, Q2C paid the Company $428,514 for its use of the G550 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Effective July 1, 2018, this arrangement was replaced with a Time Sharing Agreement. See "— 2019 Fiscal Year Changes" below. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company and Q2C were parties to an agreement, pursuant to which the Company had a right to lease on a non-exclusive basis Q2C's Gulfstream Aerospace G450 aircraft (the "G450") on reciprocal terms of the dry lease agreement for the G550. Pursuant to this arrangement, the Company paid Q2C $709,573 for use of the G450 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, inclusive of any true-up payments required under the agreement. Both the G550 Dry Lease Agreement and the G450 Dry Lease Agreement included "true-up" mechanisms such that, to the extent one party's annual usage exceeds the other party's annual usage of the other party's aircraft, the party with the greater aircraft usage would pay an additional hourly rate with respect to excess hours intended to cover the additional costs. In addition, the reciprocal arrangements provided for equitable adjustment in the event that discrepancies in hours of usage or other factors cause the arrangement to be economically unfair to either party. 
As permitted under the G450 Aircraft Dry Lease Agreement, a subsidiary of the Company is a party to a Time Sharing Agreement with AMC Networks, pursuant to which AMC Networks has the right to lease on a "time-sharing" basis the G450 from the Company. AMC Networks is required to pay us an amount equal to the actual non-fuel expenses of each flight it elects to utilize and 200% of actual fuel usage for such flights, but not exceeding the maximum amount payable under FAA rules. Pursuant to this arrangement, AMC Networks made no payments to the Company during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 because it did not use the G450 during such time period. In calculating the amounts payable under the agreement, the parties allocate in good faith the treatment of any flight that is for the benefit of both companies. 
Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company is a party to a Time Sharing Agreement with AMC Networks, pursuant to which AMC Networks has the right to lease on a "time-sharing" basis our G550. AMC Networks is required to pay us an amount equal to the actual non-fuel expenses of each flight it elects to utilize and 200% of actual fuel usage for such flights, but not exceeding the maximum amount payable under FAA rules. Pursuant to this arrangement, AMC Networks paid the Company $167,579 for use of the G550 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In calculating the amounts payable under the agreement, the parties allocate in good faith the treatment of any flight that is for the benefit of both companies. 
A subsidiary of the Company was a party to an Aircraft Dry Lease Agreement with Charles F. Dolan, a director of the Company, pursuant to which Mr. Dolan had a right to lease on a non-exclusive basis our G550. Mr. Dolan was required to pay us rent at an hourly rate and specified expenses for each flight he elects to utilize. Pursuant to these arrangements, Mr. Dolan paid the Company $77,859 for use of the G550 during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Effective July 1, 2018, this arrangement was replaced with a Time Sharing Agreement. See "— 2019 Fiscal Year Changes" below. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company and Sterling Aviation, LLC ("Sterling"), a company controlled by Charles F. Dolan, were parties to an agreement, pursuant to which the Company had a right to lease on a non-exclusive basis Sterling's Gulfstream Aerospace GV aircraft (the "GV") on reciprocal terms of the dry lease agreement for the G550. Pursuant to this arrangement, the Company paid Sterling $261,326 for use of the GV during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, inclusive of any true-up payments required under the agreement. Both the G550 Dry Lease Agreement and the GV Dry Lease Agreement with Mr. Dolan included "true-up" mechanisms such that, to the extent one party's annual usage exceeds the other   party's annual usage of the other party's aircraft, the party with the greater aircraft usage would pay an additional hourly rate with respect to excess hours intended to cover the additional costs. In addition, the reciprocal arrangements provided for equitable adjustment in the event that discrepancies in hours of usage or other factors cause the arrangement to be economically unfair to either party. 
2019 Fiscal Year Changes 
Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company has entered into various new Aircraft Support Services Agreements (the "Services Agreements"), effective July 1, 2018, pursuant to which the Company provides aircraft support services to an entity controlled by James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director, of the Company, an entity controlled by Charles F Dolan, a director of the Company, and an entity controlled by Patrick Dolan, the son of Charles F. Dolan and brother of James L Dolan. Pursuant to the Services Agreements, the Company provides certain aircraft support services in exchange for a monthly management fee, including providing pilots, crew and maintenance personnel, aircraft maintenance, FAA compliance, flight scheduling and dispatch services, negotiation/management of third-party contracts and other services necessary and appropriate for the support of aircraft. 
In addition, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company entered into new aircraft dry lease agreements and/or time sharing agreements with Charles F. Dolan, Sterling (an entity controlled by Charles F. Dolan), and Q2C (an entity controlled by James L. Dolan), effective July 1, 2018. which replace the agreements described above under "— 2018 Fiscal Year Arrangements" and are intended to substantially replicate these arrangements with those parties, except that as required by FAA regulations, only the aircraft dry lease agreements for Q2C's and/or Sterling's use of the Company's G550 include a "true up" mechanism. Similar to the prior arrangements, the true-up mechanism provides that if the Company's annual usage of Sterling's GV and/or Q2C's G450 exceeds either party's annual usage of the Company's G550, the Company would pay additional amounts for such excess hours intended to cover the additional costs to the applicable party. Because it is not permitted by FAA rules, a similar mechanism is not included in the time sharing agreements for Charles F. Dolan and/or Q2C's use of the Company's G550. However, based on historical usage between the parties, it is expected that the Company's annual usage of the GV and/or G450 will exceed Charles F. Dolan's and/or Q2C's annual usage of the G550. 
DOLAN FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS 
The Company charges the Knickerbocker Group, LLC, an entity owned by James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman and a director of the Company, for office space equal to the allocated cost of such space and certain technology services provided in connection with the use of such space. The amount paid by the Knickerbocker Group, LLC during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $194,497. In addition, from time to time, certain other services of the Company may be made available to members of the Dolan family and to entities owned by them. It is the policy of the Company to receive reimbursement for the costs of these services. See "Stock 
 Ownership Table" for a description of registration rights agreements among the Dolan family interests and the Company. 
The Company is party to an arrangement with Dolan Family Office, LLC ("DFO LLC"), a company controlled by Charles F. Dolan, MSG Networks and AMC Networks providing for the sharing of certain expenses associated with executive office space which is available to James L. Dolan, Charles F. Dolan and DFO LLC. The Company's portion of such office space expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $25,884.  In addition, the Company and certain Dolan family entities are party to aircraft arrangements described above. See "— Aircraft Arrangements." 
OTHER 
Since the MSG Distribution Date, Charles A. Tese, the brother of Vincent Tese, a director of the Company, has been employed by MSG Sports & Entertainment, LLC ("MSGSE"), a subsidiary of the Company, in a non-executive officer position. Previously, Charles A. Tese was employed by a subsidiary of MSG Networks in a non-executive officer position from 2005 until the MSG Distribution Date and Vincent Tese served as a director of MSG Networks from 2010 until the MSG Distribution Date. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Charles A. Tese earned $119,681. 
Since March 14, 2016, Ryan Dolan, the son of James L. Dolan, the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director, of the Company, has been employed by a subsidiary of the Company, in a non-executive officer position. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Ryan Dolan earned $125,509. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James L. Dolan, also serves as the Executive Chairman of MSG Networks, our Vice Chairman, Gregg G. Seibert, also serves as Vice Chairman of MSG Networks and AMC Networks, and our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Lawrence J. Burian, also serves as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of MSG Networks. Six of our director nominees (including James L. Dolan) also serve as directors of MSG Networks, and James L. Dolan serves as an executive officer of MSG Networks concurrently with his service on our Board. Eight of our director nominees (including James L. Dolan) also serve as directors of AMC Networks, and Charles F. Dolan serves as an executive officer of AMC Networks concurrently with his service on our Board. Therefore, these officers and directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting the Company, on the one hand, and MSG Networks or AMC Networks, on the other hand. For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we and MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks look at certain acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for more than one of the companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks and us. In addition, certain of our officers and directors own MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, stock options and/or performance stock options. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company, MSG Networks or AMC Networks. See "Related Party Transaction Approval Policy" below for a discussion of certain procedures we instituted to help ameliorate any such potential conflicts that may arise. 
Our Certificate of Incorporation acknowledges that the Company may have overlapping directors and officers with MSG Networks and AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such entities. In our Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and provided that in certain circumstances our directors and officers will not   have liability to the Company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to MSG Networks or AMC Networks or any of their respective subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Company. The Certificate of Incorporation also expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and MSG Networks and AMC Networks and/or any of their respective subsidiaries and provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the actions of the overlapping directors and officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company or its stockholders. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION APPROVAL POLICY 
The Company has adopted a written policy whereby an Independent Committee of our Board reviews and approves or takes such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and in which any director, executive officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404, which currently apply to transactions (or any series of similar transactions) in which the amount involved exceeds the dollar threshold set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC (currently $120,000). To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, the Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of those transactions. The policy does not cover decisions on compensation or benefits or the hiring or retention of any person. The hiring or retention of executive officers is determined by our full Board. Compensation of executive officers is subject to the approval of our Compensation Committee. This policy also does not cover any pro rata distributions to all Company stockholders, including a pro rata distribution of our Class A Common Stock to holders of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock to holders of our Class B Common Stock. No director on the Independent Committee will participate in the consideration of a related party transaction with that director or any related person of that director. 
In addition, our Board has adopted a special approval policy for transactions with MSG Networks and AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries whether or not such transactions qualify as "related party" transactions described above. Under this policy, the Independent Committee oversees approval of all transactions and arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each of MSG Networks and its subsidiaries and/or AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in which the amount exceeds the current $120,000 threshold. To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, an Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of these transactions. The approval requirement does not apply to the implementation and administration of the intercompany arrangements under the policy but does cover any amendments, modifications, terminations or extensions involving amounts in excess of the current $120,000 threshold, as well as the handling and resolution of any disputes involving amounts in excess of the current $120,000 threshold. Our executive officers and directors who are also senior executives or directors of MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks may participate in the negotiation, execution, amendment, modification, or termination of intercompany arrangements subject to the policy, as well as in any resolution of disputes thereunder, on behalf of any or all of the Company, MSG Networks and/or AMC   Networks, as applicable, in each case under the direction or ultimate approval of an Independent Committee or the comparable committee of the board of directors of the Company, MSG Networks and/or AMC Networks, as applicable. 
Currently, and throughout our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Audit Committee served as the Independent Committee under the above policies. 
Our related party transaction approval policy cannot be amended or terminated without the prior approval of a majority of the Company's independent directors and by a majority of the directors elected by our Class B Common Stockholders. For purposes of this policy, "independent directors" means those directors who have been determined by our Board to be independent directors for purposes of the NYSE's corporate governance standards. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, certain executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. The SEC regulations require the Company to identify anyone who failed to file a required report or filed a late report during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Based solely on a review of reports filed under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company is aware of no such failure, except that The Charles F. Dolan 2009 Revocable Trust did not timely file a Form 3.  STOCK OWNERSHIP TABLE 
The table sets forth certain information as of October 10, 2018 with respect to the beneficial ownership of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock by (i) each person the Company believes beneficially holds more than 
 5% of any class of the outstanding shares of the Company based solely on the Company's review of SEC filings, (ii) each director or director nominee of the Company and (iii) each NEO of the Company.

 The Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family (collectively, the "Dolan Family Group"), by virtue of their ownership of Class B Common Stock, are able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class, and to elect up to 75% of the Company's Board. Members of the Dolan Family Group are parties to a Stockholders Agreement, which has the effect of causing the voting power of the holders of Class B Common Stock to be cast as a block on all matters to be voted on by holders of Class B Common Stock. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the shares of Class B Common Stock owned by members of the Dolan family group are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Dolan Family Committee, except that the decisions of the Dolan Family Committee are non-binding with respect to the Class B shares owned by certain Dolan family trusts that collectively own approximately 40.5% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock ("Excluded Trusts"). The Dolan Family Committee consists of Charles F. Dolan and five of his children, James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney and Marianne Dolan Weber. The Dolan Family Committee generally acts by a majority vote, except that a going private transaction must be approved by a two-thirds vote and a change in control transaction must be approved by not less than all but one vote. The voting members of the Dolan Family Committee are James L Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney and Marianne Dolan Weber, with each member having one vote other than James L. Dolan, who has two votes. Because James L. Dolan has two votes, he has the ability to block Dolan Family Committee approval of any Company change in control transaction. Shares of Class B Common Stock owned by the Excluded Trusts are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Excluded Trusts holding a majority of the Class B Common Stock held by all Excluded Trusts, except in the case of a vote on a going-private transaction or a change in control transaction, in which case a vote of trusts holding two-thirds of the Class B Common Stock owned by the Excluded Trusts is required. 
Charles F. Dolan, all other holders of Class B Common Stock (other than the Charles F. Dolan Children Trusts), the Dolan Children's Foundation, the Dolan Family Foundation and the Company have entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Dolan Registration Rights Agreement"). Under this agreement, the Company will provide the parties to the Dolan Registration Rights Agreement (the "Dolan Parties") (and, in certain cases, transferees and pledgees of shares of Class B Common Stock owned by these parties) with certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock (including those issued upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock). As of October 10, 2018, the Dolan Parties owned approximately 2.7 million shares of Class B Common Stock (the "Dolan Shares"), which represented approximately 59.8% of our Class B Common Stock as well as 461,081 shares of Class A Common Stock (including options), which represented approximately 2.4% of our Class A Common Stock. Such shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, collectively, represented approximately 13.4% of our Common Stock and 42.7% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Stock. 
The Charles F. Dolan Children Trusts (the "Children Trusts") and the Company have entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement"). Under this agreement, the Company will provide the Children Trusts (and, in certain cases, transferees and pledgees of shares of Class B Common Stock owned by these parties) with certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock (including those issued upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock). As of October 10, 2018, the Children Trusts owned 1,822,898 shares of Class B Common Stock (the "Children Trust Shares"), which represented approximately 40.2% of our Class B Common Stock, as well as   90,406 shares of Class A Common Stock, which represented 0.5% of our Class A Common Stock. Such shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, collectively, represented approximately 8.1% of our Common Stock and 28.4% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Stock. 
In the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement, each Children Trust has agreed that in the case of any sale or disposition of its shares of Class B Common Stock (other than to Charles F. Dolan or other Dolan family interests) by such Children Trust, or of any of the Children Trust Shares by any other Dolan family interest to which such shares of Class B Common Stock are transferred, such stock will be converted to Class A Common Stock. The Dolan Registration Rights Agreement does not include a comparable conversion obligation, and the conversion obligation in the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement does not apply to the Dolan Shares. 
The Dolan Registration Rights Agreement and the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement are included as exhibits to our 2018 Form 10-K, and the foregoing discussion of those agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to those agreements as filed.

October 25, 2018  ANNEX A — RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP AMOUNTS 
The Company believes that presenting Adjusted Operating Income ("AOI"), a non-GAAP measure, is meaningful, as it reflects metrics considered by the Compensation Committee in making its compensation determinations. The Company defines adjusted operating income (loss), or "AOI," as operating income (loss) before (1) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (2) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (3) restructuring charges or credits, (4) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses and (5) the impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to business acquisitions. Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOI also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. The Company believes AOI is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. AOI and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze the Company's performance. Internally, the Company uses revenues and AOI measures as the most important indicators of its business performance, and evaluates management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. AOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since AOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. All dollar amounts included in this Annex A are presented in thousands, except as otherwise noted. 
The following is a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP) to AOI (non-GAAP):
