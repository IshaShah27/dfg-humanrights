Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials  for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders To Be Held on Friday, November 16, 2018

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 
You are receiving this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. This proxy statement contains detailed information you need to know in order to vote at the annual meeting. The proxy card is used for voting on the proposals.
What am I voting on? 
You are being asked to vote on the following items at the annual meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   1.   To elect the two nominees named in the proxy statement as Class II directors, each to serve for a three-year term and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   4.   To consider and act upon any other matters that are properly brought before the annual meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. At this time we are not aware of any such other matters.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote? 
If you were a shareholder of record of voting common stock (a "Voting Shareholder") as of the close of business on September 21, 2018, (the "Record Date"), you are entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and to vote the shares of voting common stock that you held as of the close of business on the Record Date, if any.
May I attend the meeting? 
All shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date, or their designated proxies, are authorized to attend the annual meeting. Each shareholder of record and proxy will be asked to present a valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, before being admitted. If you are not a shareholder of record but you hold your shares in "street name," you should provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as an account statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership. We reserve the right to determine the validity of any purported proof of beneficial ownership. If you do not have proof of ownership, you may not be admitted to the annual meeting. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted, and attendees may be subject to security inspections and other security precautions.
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of voting common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 8,226,647 shares of voting common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each share of voting common stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled to one vote on each matter properly submitted at the annual meeting and, with respect to the election of directors, one vote for each director to be elected. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares represented at the meeting held by brokers, as to which instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote such shares and with respect to which, on one or more but not all matters, the broker does not have discretionary voting power to vote such shares) will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the annual meeting.
How do I vote? 
Voting in Person at the Meeting. If you are a Voting Shareholder as of the Record Date and attend the annual meeting, you may vote in person at the meeting. If your shares of voting common stock are held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of voting common stock of record.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES AND BOARD MATTERS
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors, which is elected by the Voting Shareholders, is responsible for the overall management of the business and affairs of Northeast. It has the ultimate decision-making authority, except with respect to those matters reserved to shareholders. The Board and its committees review Northeast's long-term strategic plans and exercise direct decision-making authority in a number of areas, such as declaring a dividend. The Board of Directors selects, advises and monitors the performance of the senior management team, which is charged with the conduct of Northeast's business and the implementation of the Board's strategic plan. The Board of Directors also reviews development and succession plans for Northeast's senior executive officers, as needed.
The Board of Directors currently consists of seven members divided into three classes. Class I directors are Robert R. Glauber and Richard Wayne; Class II directors are Matthew B. Botein and Cheryl Lynn Dorsey; and Class III directors are John C. Orestis, David A. Tanner and Judith E. Wallingford. The terms of the Class II directors will expire at the 2018 annual meeting.
Directors of the company are also directors of Northeast Bank (the "Bank"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast.
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that govern the structure of the Board of Directors and outline the Board's policies on a number of Northeast's corporate governance issues and procedures. These guidelines embody long-standing practices of Northeast and also include procedures designed to incorporate current corporate governance best practices. Northeast's corporate governance practices are designed to align the interests of the Board and management with those of Northeast's shareholders and to promote honesty and integrity throughout the company. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the company's website under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.northeastbank.com/about-us.
Director Qualifications and Independence 
Applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market (the "NASDAQ Listing Rules"), the exchange on which Northeast's voting common stock is listed, and the Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the Board of Directors consist of a majority of independent directors. The Board of Directors evaluates the relationships between each director (or his or her immediate family members and related interests) and the company to determine a director's independence under the NASDAQ Listing Rules. Based on that review, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each director, other than Mr. Wayne, is independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules.
Executive Sessions of the Board 
As provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent directors meet in executive session at least quarterly and often monthly, following a meeting of the Board of Directors. The chairman of the Board of Directors, also the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee"), presides at these sessions.
Board Attendance and Annual Meeting Policy 
It is the company's policy that directors should make every effort to attend each meeting of the Board of Directors, each meeting of the committees on which they serve, and the annual meeting of shareholders. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018"), there were 12 meetings of the Board of Directors, and each of the directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors (held during the period for which he or she had been a director) and committees on which he or she served (during the periods that he or she served). Directors are expected to attend annual meetings of shareholders in person unless doing so is impracticable due to unavoidable conflicts. Six directors of Northeast attended the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.
Board Leadership 
In accordance with the company's bylaws, the Board elects an independent director as the Chairman of the Board and also appoints the President, who also serves as Chief Executive Officer. Robert Glauber serves as Northeast's Chairman of the Board, and Richard Wayne serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company. The Chairman is responsible for the management, development and effective functioning of the Board and provides leadership in every aspect of the Board's oversight of the company. The Chairman also acts in an advisory capacity to the President and Chief Executive Officer, and to other executive officers in matters concerning the interests of the company and the Board, as well as serving as the liaison between management and the Board. The Chairman and the President and Chief Executive Officer work closely to ensure that the strategic goals of Northeast's management team are in line with the risk and governance oversight objectives of the Board of Directors.
Board Committee Membership and Meetings 
The committees of the Board of Directors include an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ("Governance Committee") and Risk Management Committee. These committees assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. All of the members of the committees are nominated by the Governance Committee and appointed by the Board of Directors. Members of these committees are elected annually at the Board of Directors' meeting following the annual meeting of shareholders. Each of these committees is composed entirely of independent directors. Each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Governance Committee and the Risk Management Committee operates under a committee charter approved by the Board of Directors setting out the purposes and responsibilities of the committee.

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee currently consists of Mses. Wallingford and Dorsey and Mr. Orestis. Each member of the Audit Committee is independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules and meets the criteria for independence as set forth in the SEC rules applicable to an audit committee.
The Audit Committee (i) oversees the accounting, financial reporting and internal control processes and the audits of financial statements; (ii) takes, or recommends that the Board take, appropriate action to oversee the qualifications, independence and performance of independent auditors; and (iii) prepares the report required by the rules of the SEC to be included in the proxy statement.
The Audit Committee held nine meetings during fiscal 2018. The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Wallingford qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee's charter is available on the company's website under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.northeastbank.com/about-us.
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Botein and Glauber and Mses. Dorsey and Wallingford. Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules.
The Compensation Committee oversees overall compensation structure, policies and programs, reviews processes and procedures for the consideration and determination of director and executive compensation, and is responsible for producing a report for inclusion in the proxy statement relating to the company's annual meeting of shareholders or annual report on Form 10-K, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. The primary objective of the Compensation Committee is to develop and implement compensation policies and plans that ensure the attraction and retention of key management personnel, the motivation of management to achieve Northeast's corporate goals and strategies, and the alignment of the interests of management with the long-term interests of Northeast's shareholders.
The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of all executive officers. The Compensation Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors regarding the compensation of non-employee directors. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to conduct market compensation reviews for its named executive officers and directors. For additional information on the Compensation Committee's process for the consideration and determination of the executive officer and director compensation and the engagement of the compensation consultant, please see "Executive Compensation."
The Compensation Committee held two meetings during fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee's charter is available on the company's website under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.northeastbank.com/about-us.
Governance Committee. The Governance Committee currently consists of Messrs. Glauber and Orestis and Ms. Dorsey. Each member of the Governance Committee is independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules.
The Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become board members, consistent with criteria approved by the Board, and recommending that the Board select the director nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. The Governance Committee is also responsible for developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance guidelines applicable to Northeast, periodically reviewing such guidelines and recommending any changes thereto, and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and management.
The Governance Committee held two meetings during fiscal 2018. The Governance Committee Charter is available on the company's website under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.northeastbank.com/about-us.
Risk Management Committee. The Risk Management Committee currently consists of Messrs. Orestis, Botein and Tanner and Ms. Wallingford. The Risk Management Committee monitors and approves the company's levels of risk tolerance and related metrics on a comprehensive, enterprise-wide basis, and identifies and monitors key risks individually, approves levels of risk tolerance for each, and evaluates arrangements for the management thereof. The Risk Management Committee further provides a forum for consideration and discussion of trends and emerging risks.
The Risk Management Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2018.
Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors plays an important role in the risk oversight of the company and is involved in risk oversight through direct decision-making authority with respect to significant matters, including the development of limits and specific risk tolerances, and the oversight of management by the Board of Directors and its committees. The Board and its committees are also each directly responsible for considering risks and the oversight of risks relating to decisions that each committee is responsible for making. In light of Northeast's overall business, market and regulatory framework under which Northeast operates, and the complexities of Northeast's operations as a whole, the Board has established a Risk Management Committee, tasked with specific responsibility for direct oversight of the risks inherent in Northeast's business, along with management of the enterprise-wide risk management program.
In addition to the Risk Management Committee, the Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function through (1) the review and discussion of regular periodic reports to the Board of Directors and its committees on topics relating to the risks that Northeast faces, including, among others, credit risk, interest rate risk, regulatory risk and various other matters relating to Northeast's business; (2) the required approval by the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of significant transactions and other decisions, including, among others, final budgets, material uses of capital, strategic direction, and executive management hiring and promotions; (3) the direct oversight of specific areas of Northeast's business by the Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Governance Committee; and (4) regular periodic reports from the company's internal and external auditors and other third party consultants regarding various areas of potential risk, including, among others, those relating to the company's internal controls and financial reporting. The Board of Directors also relies on management to bring significant matters impacting the company to the Board's attention.
Consideration of Director Nominees 
Shareholder Recommendations. The Governance Committee's current policy is to review and consider any director candidates who have been recommended by shareholders in compliance with the procedures established from time to time by the Governance Committee and set forth in the Governance Committee charter. All shareholder recommendations for director candidates must be submitted to Corporate Clerk at Northeast Bancorp, 500 Canal Street, Lewiston, ME 04240, who will forward all recommendations to the Governance Committee.
Board Membership Criteria. The Governance Committee has established criteria for the Governance Committee-recommended director nominees. These criteria include the following specific, minimum qualifications that the Governance Committee believes must be met by each Governance Committee-recommended nominee for a position on the Board:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The nominee shall have experience at a strategic or policymaking level in a business, government, non-profit or academic organization of high standing.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The nominee shall be highly accomplished in his or her respective field, with superior credentials and recognition.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The nominee shall be well regarded in the community and shall have a long-term reputation for the highest ethical and moral standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The nominee shall have sufficient time and availability to devote to the affairs of the company, particularly in light of the number of boards on which the nominee may serve.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● To the extent such nominee serves or has previously served on other boards, the nominee shall have a demonstrated history of actively contributing at board meetings.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the minimum qualifications for each nominee set forth above, the Governance Committee shall recommend that the Board select persons for nomination to help ensure that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A majority of the Board shall be independent under the NASDAQ Listing Rules.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Each of its Audit, Compensation, Governance and Risk Management Committees shall be comprised entirely of independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● At least one member of the Audit Committee shall have such experience, education and other qualifications necessary to qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules of the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
Finally, in addition to any other standards the Governance Committee may deem appropriate from time to time for the overall structure and composition of the Board, the Governance Committee may consider the following factors when recommending that the Board select persons for nomination:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Whether the nominee has direct experience in the financial services industry or in the markets in which the company operates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Whether the nominee, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of background and experience.  
[END TABLE]
Identifying and Evaluating Nominees. The Governance Committee may solicit recommendations for director nominees from any or all of the following sources: non-management directors, the Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers, third-party search firms or any other source it deems appropriate.
The Governance Committee will review and evaluate the qualifications of any proposed director candidate that it is considering or has been recommended to it by a shareholder in compliance with the Governance Committee's procedures for that purpose, and conduct inquiries it deems appropriate into the background of the proposed director candidates. In identifying and evaluating proposed director candidates, the Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the minimum qualifications for Governance Committee-recommended director nominees, all facts and circumstances that it deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, the skills of the proposed director candidate, his or her depth and breadth of business experience, his or her independence and the needs of the Board. Neither the Governance Committee nor the Board has a specific policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, although both may consider diversity when identifying and evaluating proposed director candidates. As noted above, the Governance Committee, when recommending director candidates to the full Board for nomination, may consider whether a director candidate, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of background and experience. Other than circumstances in which Northeast may be legally required by contract or otherwise to provide third parties with the ability to nominate directors, the Governance Committee will evaluate all proposed director candidates that it considers or who have been properly recommended to it by a shareholder based on the same criteria and in substantially the same manner, with no regard to the source of the initial recommendation of the proposed director candidate.
Communications with Directors 
The Board of Directors has established a process for shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with the Board or a particular director. A shareholder may send a letter to Northeast Bancorp, Attention: Corporate Clerk, 500 Canal Street, Lewiston, ME 04240. The mailing envelope should contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Board communication" or "director communication." All such letters should state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board or just certain specified individual directors. The Corporate Clerk will circulate the communications (with the exception of commercial solicitations) to the appropriate director or directors. Communications marked "Confidential" will be forwarded unopened. A log of all correspondence addressed to the directors will be kept for periodic review by the Governance Committee and any other interested director.
Code of Ethics 
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of the directors, officers and employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. The company is committed to the highest standards of ethical and professional conduct, and the Code of Ethics provides guidance on how to uphold these standards. The Code of Ethics consists of basic standards of business practice as well as professional and personal conduct. Any material amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics (to the extent applicable to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer) will be promptly disclosed by the company. The Governance Committee has been charged with reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of the Code of Ethics annually and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Code of Ethics is available on the company's website under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.northeastbank.com/about-us.

PROPOSAL 1  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Introduction 
The Board of Directors consists of seven members divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. At the 2018 annual meeting, two Class II directors will be elected to serve for a three-year term until the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Following the recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board has nominated all of the current Class II directors for re-election.
Vote Required 
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of voting common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at the annual meeting. Votes may be cast for or withheld from each nominee. Votes cast for the nominees will count as "yes" votes. Votes that are withheld from the nominees will not be voted with respect to the director or directors indicated. Withheld votes and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the director elections.
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR its nominees, Matthew B. Botein and Cheryl Lynn Dorsey. Properly authorized proxies solicited by the Board will be voted FOR each of the nominees unless instructions to the contrary are given.
Information Regarding the Nominees, Other Directors and Executive Officers 
The following biographical descriptions set forth certain information with respect to the nominees for election as directors at the annual meeting, each director who is not standing for election and the executive officers who are not directors, based on information furnished to the company by each nominee, director and executive officer. Each executive officer holds office until the regular meeting of the Board of Directors following the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.
The biographical description below for each nominee includes the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led to the conclusion by the Board of Directors that such person should serve as a director of Northeast. The biographical description of each director who is not standing for election includes the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that the Board of Directors would expect to consider if it were making a conclusion currently as to whether such person should serve as a director. The Board of Directors did not currently evaluate whether these directors should serve as directors, as the terms for which they have been previously elected continue beyond the annual meeting.

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
We seek to attract and retain talented and committed employees and executives. Our compensation program is intended to meet the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Attract, develop, retain and motivate talented leadership to achieve the company's strategic objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Align management's interests with those of the shareholders through the use of equity plans approved by the Board and shareholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Reward high performance, promote accountability and adherence to the company's values and its Code of Ethics.  
[END TABLE]
Role of Compensation Committee, Outside Advisors and Management in Compensation Decisions 
The company has operated under the same compensation philosophy since fiscal 2011. The company has not made any major changes to our executive compensation program since that time, although the Compensation Committee monitors our pay program through regular market-based studies performed by their independent consultant. Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain a talented leadership team committed to driving superior results that deliver long-term shareholder value. Our incentive programs are designed to promote pay for performance and reward executives for performance that is aligned with the company's objectives, which ultimately creates long-term shareholder value. Annually, we review our compensation philosophy and our pay programs to ensure that our compensation program meets our objectives and aligns with our performance and business strategy while maintaining good corporate governance practices.
The Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, provides management and the Board with guidance on matters of executive and director compensation and related benefits. The Compensation Committee meets in executive sessions when discussing CEO performance and specific actions related to CEO compensation. The Compensation Committee determines, after discussion with the Board, the compensation of the company's CEO, and determines all compensation actions for the company's other executive officers after reviewing the recommendations of the CEO. The Compensation Committee relies on management and outside advisers for staff work and technical guidance in conducting its affairs. It retains full authority to engage independent third party advisers, including PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, to conduct independent studies and provide objective advice on executive and director compensation. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's primary role with the company has been as independent adviser to the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters. The company also retains Goodwin Procter LLP for legal and advisory services on executive compensation matters, including the drafting of compensation plan documents. The company may use other firms from time to time in the normal course of business.
Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Votes
The company provides its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers ("Say-on-Pay"). At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on November 17, 2017, 94% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms shareholder support of the company's approach to executive compensation.
Total Compensation Market Benchmarking and Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee, with the advice of its independent compensation consultant, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, approved an updated peer group in August 2016, which was used for market comparisons in fiscal 2018. The peer group included 20 banks of similar asset and revenue size, revenue mix and business orientation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Bankwell Financial Group Inc.   Enterprise Bancorp, Inc.  
 Bar Harbor Bankshares   Evans Bancorp, Inc.  
 Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc.   First Bancorp Inc.  
 Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc.   Independent Bank Corp.  
 Brookline Bancorp, Inc.   Meridian Bancorp, Inc.  
 BSB Bancorp, Inc.   Salisbury Bancorp Inc.  
 Camden National Corporation   Sussex Bancorp  
 Chemung Financial Corporation   Union Bankshares Inc.  
 Clifton Bancorp, Inc.   United Financial Bancorp, Inc.  
 Community Bancorp Inc.   Western New England Bancorp  
[END TABLE]
This peer group was used as one market frame of reference for compensation comparisons. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has provided other relevant market reference points, such as broader financial services and general industry compensation survey data covering companies of similar size to augment this peer group data. Given the company's objective to attract and retain the talent necessary to meet its strategic objectives, the company currently relies primarily on the internal judgment of the Compensation Committee for performance and compensation benchmarking using an evaluation of both financial and non-financial goals. These goals include growing each of our divisions, fully deploying all raised capital, and enhancing and leveraging the operational capacity of the company. As a result, the Compensation Committee has placed less emphasis on total compensation benchmarking.
Principles for Setting Compensation Levels 
The factors considered by the company in setting executive compensation levels are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Achievement of the company's long-term strategic objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Alignment of management's interests with those of shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Risk tolerances, and in particular whether compensation programs encourage excessive risk-taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Retention of its executive team;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Cost considerations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Regulatory constraints and guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
The company believes that the aggregate total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table for its named executive officers is reasonable and fair based on the above factors. Specifically:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A portion of named executive officer compensation is tied to, and varies with, the overall performance of the company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The equity grants made to Mr. Wayne in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2017 include a significant performance-based equity incentive component; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Named executive officer compensation is appropriate in light of the competitive environment for recruiting executive officers, and what competitors pay.  
[END TABLE]
Elements of Executive Compensation 
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of its named executive officers each year. Salary increases, if any, are generally based on the executive's performance within specific areas of accountability, external market competitiveness and internal budget considerations. The base salaries of our Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer     Base Salary FY2018 ($)       Base Salary FY2017 ($)       Percent Increase    
 Richard Wayne      600,000       600,000       0%  
 Jean-Pierre Lapointe (1)      225,000       N/A       N/A 
 Brian Pinheiro      238,702       231,750       3%  
 Patrick Dignan      400,000       400,000       0%  
 Julie Jenkins      224,009       217,485       3%  
   (1)   Mr. Lapointe's employment with the company commenced in November 2017, and the amounts set forth above reflect his starting base salary. Because his base salary was prorated to his start date, the salary paid to Mr. Lapointe, as reflected in our Summary Compensation Table, differs from the amount set forth above.  
[END TABLE]
Discretionary Performance Bonuses
We have not historically implemented a formal bonus program for our named executive officers. Rather, the Compensation Committee awards discretionary bonuses after the completion of a fiscal year, based upon its evaluation of the company's performance and individual contributions. In making its decisions with respect to named executive officers other than Mr. Wayne, the Compensation Committee relies upon the recommendations of Mr. Wayne. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to award the following cash bonus amounts with respect to fiscal 2018 performance:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer     FY2018 Bonus ($)    
 Richard Wayne      400,000   
 Jean-Pierre Lapointe      65,000   
 Brian Pinheiro      100,000   
 Patrick Dignan      300,000   
 Julie Jenkins      125,000   
[END TABLE]
Equity-Based Long-Term Incentives 
The Compensation Committee considers long-term equity-based compensation to be an integral part of the company's compensation program. In making equity awards, the Compensation Committee considered the benefit to the company of having a significant portion of the executives' compensation tied to the long-term financial performance of the company, and thereby to shareholder value. The Compensation Committee also considered the experience and qualifications of the executives, their ability to execute the company's business plan, the retention value of long-term equity incentives and peer compensation data.
In August 2016, Mr. Wayne was granted 15,000 restricted shares that fully vest on August 25, 2019, subject to his continued employment through that date, and 50,000 restricted shares that are performance-based (the "2016 Performance Shares"). The 2016 Performance Shares are subject to performance-based vesting over a three-year performance period (the "performance period"). The 2016 Performance Shares include an absolute metric and a sliding metric within the performance period. The absolute metric requires that in order for Mr. Wayne to be eligible to vest in the 2016 Performance Shares in any given year within the performance period, the company must be in full compliance at all times with the regulatory commitments made to the Federal Reserve Bank and Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions, and neither the bank nor the company is subject to any written agreement, Board resolution, memorandum of understanding or consent with any regulatory agency. Once it has been determined that the absolute metric has been met, Mr. Wayne will vest in the 2016 Performance Shares based on reaching certain thresholds in regards to the company's return on equity ("ROE"). For the 2016 Performance Shares, the ROE targets and vesting schedule are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     ROE Target       Shares vested: <70% ROE Target       Shares vested: 70% - <80% ROE Target       Shares vested: 80% - <90% ROE Target       Shares vested: 90% - 100% ROE Target    
     ROE Target       Shares vested: <70% ROE Target       Shares vested: 70% - <80% ROE Target       Shares vested: 80% - <90% ROE Target       Shares vested: 90% - 100% ROE Target    
 FY17      8.67%     —       5,000       7,500       10,000   
 FY18      11.60%     —       5,000       7,500       10,000   
 FY19      13.30%     —       5,000       7,500       10,000   
 3 Year Cumulative      11.17%     —       10,000       15,000       20,000   
[END TABLE]
The company achieved an ROE of 10.62% and 12.47% for each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Accordingly, the company exceeded the ROE targets for each of fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, and Mr. Wayne has vested in an aggregate of 20,000 of the 2016 Performance Shares.
In November 2017, in connection with commencement of his employment, Mr. Lapointe was granted 2,000 restricted shares, which shall vest in three equal annual installments, commencing on November 8, 2020. No shares were awarded to Messrs. Wayne, Pinheiro, Dignan or Ms. Jenkins in fiscal 2018.
In August 2018, Mr. Wayne was granted 15,000 restricted shares, Mr. Pinheiro was granted 5,500 restricted shares, Mr. Lapointe was granted 4,000 restricted shares, Mr. Dignan was granted 10,000 restricted shares, and Ms. Jenkins was granted 5,500 restricted shares, all of which vest in three equal annual installments, commencing on August 14, 2021. In addition, Messrs. Wayne and Dignan were granted 15,000 and 10,000 restricted shares that are performance-based (the "2018 Performance Shares"). The 2018 Performance Shares are subject to performance-based vesting over a three-year performance period (the "performance period"). The 2018 Performance Shares include an absolute metric and a sliding metric within the performance period. The absolute metric requires that in order for Messrs. Wayne and Dignan to be eligible to vest in the 2018 Performance Shares in any given year within the performance period, the company must be in full compliance at all times with the regulatory commitments made to the Federal Reserve Bank and Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions, and neither the bank nor the company is subject to any written agreement, Board resolution, memorandum of understanding or consent with any regulatory agency. Once it has been determined that the absolute metric has been met, Messrs. Wayne and Dignan will vest in the 2018 Performance Shares based on reaching certain thresholds in regards to the company's ROE. The ROE targets and vesting schedule are as follows:
Richard Wayne

The restricted share awards granted to each of our named executive officers vest immediately upon the termination of the executive's employment due to death or disability. In addition, upon a change in control of the company, (i) in the case of a change in control in which such awards are assumed or continued by the successor entity, any unvested time-based restricted shares will vest in full if the executive's employment is terminated without cause on or following such change in control and (ii) in the case of a change in control in which such awards are not assumed or continued by the successor entity, any unvested time-based restricted shares will vest in full. In addition, upon a change in control of the company, any unvested 2016 Performance Shares or 2018 Performance Shares will convert to time-based restricted shares that will vest in full at the end of each performance period, subject to the named executive officer's continued employment through the last day of such performance period. If an acquirer does not assume, continue or substitute the performance shares, or the named executive officer's employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason following a change in control, the performance shares will vest in full upon the change in control, termination or resignation, as applicable.
Executive Benefits 
All named executive officers are eligible for company-sponsored benefit programs available broadly to company employees, including healthcare and dental benefits, disability insurance and life insurance. The company also maintains a traditional 401(k) plan pursuant to which the company matches half of an employee's contribution, up to 6% of the employee's salary.
Employment Agreement
On December 29, 2010, the company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Wayne with an initial term of three years. Upon expiration of the initial term, the employment agreement will be renewed for successive terms of one year, unless either party gives written notice not less than 90 days prior to the date of any such anniversary of the election not to extend the term.
Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Wayne is entitled to receive an annual base salary, which may be increased from time to time in accordance with normal business practices and in the sole discretion of the company. Mr. Wayne is also eligible to participate in the company's non-equity incentive compensation and equity-based long term incentive plans as determined by the company's Compensation Committee and in any benefit programs that the company establishes and makes available to its employees.
The employment agreement contains restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation covenants that survive for 24 months following the termination of employment.
The employment agreement describes the payments and benefits to which Mr. Wayne would be entitled upon termination of his employment under certain circumstances. Specifically, if (i) Mr. Wayne's employment is terminated either by the company without cause or by such executive for good reason or if the company makes an election not to extend the term of any such employment agreement, and (ii) Mr. Wayne executes a release of claims prepared by the company, the non-competition restrictions in the applicable employment agreement will terminate unless the company (in the sole discretion of the Board) pays such executive an amount equal to the base salary such executive would have received for the duration of the restricted period.
Tax, Regulatory and Accounting Implications 
The Compensation Committee considers the accounting and tax (individual and corporate) consequences of the compensation plans prior to making changes to the plans. In the consideration of Named Officer compensation, including the granting of equity awards, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") (which generally limits the deduction of compensation paid to certain named officers to $1,000,000). While the Compensation Committee considers tax deductibility as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions, and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of the company's executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible for tax purposes. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed as part of the Tax Reform Act, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for the limited transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.
While the Compensation Committee has made efforts to structure certain performance-based grants of restricted stock in a manner intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) and therefore not subject to its deduction limits, because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the Tax Reform Act, no assurance can be made that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) in fact will. Further, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the company's business needs. The Compensation Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served if discretion and flexibility in awarding compensation is not restricted, even though some compensation awards may result in a non-deductible compensation expense to the company.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation Decisions
The Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of the following independent directors: Messrs. Botein and Glauber and Mses. Dorsey and Wallingford. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current, or was a former, officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on this review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the company's Proxy Statement.

CEO Pay Ratio
The company is making its initial disclosure of the total compensation paid to our CEO as a ratio of the total compensation paid to our median employee (the "CEO Pay Ratio"), as required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by generating a report for Form W-2 income for all employees, excluding the CEO, who received compensation during fiscal 2018. This employee population included annualized compensation for all full-time, part-time or seasonal employees as of June 30, 2018. After determining the median employee, we calculated the CEO's and median employee's fiscal 2018 total compensation in a comparable manner to the CEO compensation provided in the Summary Compensation Table.
For fiscal 2018, the total of all compensation paid to the CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $1,014,957. The total of all compensation paid to the median employee, calculated in the same manner, was $55,516. The CEO Pay Ratio was approximately 18:1.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
As discussed above in the section titled "Employment Agreement," in the event that Mr. Wayne's employment is terminated by the company without cause or by Mr. Wayne for good reason, the non-competition restrictions in Mr. Wayne's employment agreement will terminate unless the company (in the sole discretion of the Board) pays to the executive an amount equal to the base salary he would have received for the duration of the 24-month restricted period. The amount of such salary continuation, based on the salary that was in effect on June 30, 2018, would be $1,200,000.

PROPOSAL 2  ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
We are providing our Voting Shareholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules.
Our executive compensation programs and policies are designed to attract, motivate and retain executive talent, and are aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Please see the section titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for a detailed discussion of our executive compensation programs. We believe that the effectiveness of our compensation programs is demonstrated by the accomplishments of management in executing the company's business plan over the last fiscal year.
The Board of Directors recommends that Voting Shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation of Northeast's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Executive Compensation section, the compensation tables and narrative discussion, be approved."
The resolution that is the subject of this proposal will not have any binding legal effect regardless of whether or not it is approved, and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the company or the Board or creating or implying any change to the fiduciary duties of the Board. However, the Compensation Committee intends to take the results of the vote on this proposal into account in its future decisions regarding the compensation of the company's named executive officers.
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required for the approval of this proposal. Abstentions shall be included in determining the number of shares present and entitled to vote on the proposal, thus having the effect of a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, are not counted in determining the number of shares present and entitled to vote and will therefore have no effect on the outcome.
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal. Properly authorized proxies solicited by the Board will be voted FOR this proposal unless instructions to the contrary are given.
PROPOSAL 3  RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC  ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected and appointed RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2019. Although ratification by Voting Shareholders is not required by law or by our bylaws, the Audit Committee believes that submission of its selection to Voting Shareholders is a matter of good corporate governance. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of Northeast. If our Voting Shareholders do not ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP, the Audit Committee will take that fact into consideration, together with such other factors it deems relevant, in determining its next selection of independent auditors.
It is anticipated that a representative of RSM US LLP will attend the annual meeting of shareholders, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees 
Aggregate fees for professional services rendered by RSM US LLP for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were as follows:

Auditor Fees Policy
The Audit Committee has approved a policy concerning the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services to be provided by RSM US LLP, our previous independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that all services provided by RSM US LLP to us, including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services, must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; provided, however, the pre-approval requirement is waived with respect to the provision of non-audit services for the company if the "de minimis" provisions of Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act are satisfied. This authority to pre-approve non-audit services may be delegated to one or more members of the Audit Committee, who shall present all decisions to pre-approve an activity to the full Audit Committee at its first meeting following such decision.
The Audit Committee approved all audit and non-audit services provided to us for fiscal 2018 and 2017.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required for the approval of this proposal. Abstentions shall be included in determining the number of shares present and entitled to vote on the proposal, thus having the effect of a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, are not counted in determining the number of shares present and entitled to vote and will therefore have no effect on the outcome.
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal. Properly authorized proxies solicited by the Board will be voted FOR this proposal unless instructions to the contrary are given.

   (8)   With respect to information relating to Arlon Capital Partners LP, we have relied, in part, on information supplied on the Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on December 16, 2015, by Arlon Capital Partners LP ("Arlon"), Arlon Capital Partners II LP ("Arlon II"), Arlon Capital Partners General Partner II LP ("ACP GP"), Arlon Capital Partners Management Company LLC ("ACP Management"), Arlon Advisor LLC ("Arlon Advisor"), Continental Grain Company ("CGC"), and Paul J. Fribourg. ACP GP is Arlon's sole general partner. ACP Management is ACP GP's sole general partner. CGC is the sole member of Arlon Advisor and the holder of an indirect majority interest in Arlon. Mr. Fribourg is the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of CGC and one of the co-trustees and in one case, a beneficiary of various trusts established for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Fribourg's family that collectively control a majority interest in CGC. As a result, Mr. Fribourg may be deemed to have beneficial ownership with respect to all shares held by Arlon. Mr. Fribourg disclaims beneficial ownership of these shares except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires the executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of Northeast's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish Northeast with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during fiscal 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were timely satisfied, except that Julie Jenkins inadvertently made a late Form 4 filing upon becoming a Section 16(a) officer during fiscal 2018.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
The company's Code of Ethics provides guidance on transactions with related persons. Any transaction with a related person must be reviewed and approved by the full Board and determined to be "arm's length." John C. Orestis, who is a member of our Board of Directors, and his affiliates have two loans for approximately $129 thousand with the Bank. All of the loans were current as of June 30, 2018. All loans were made in the ordinary course of business under normal credit terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements prevailing at the time of origination for comparable transactions with other persons, and do not represent more than normal credit risk.
OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this proxy statement, our Board of Directors knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than as described in this proxy statement. If any other matters properly come before the annual meeting, or any adjournments or postponements of that meeting, and are voted upon, the enclosed proxies will be deemed to confer discretionary authority on the individuals that they name as proxies to vote the shares represented by these proxies as to any of these matters. The individuals named as proxies intend to vote or not to vote in accordance with the recommendation of our management.
Expenses of Solicitation
The cost of solicitation of proxies will be borne by Northeast. We also may reimburse brokers, banks, nominees and other fiduciaries for postage and reasonable clerical expenses of forwarding the proxy material to their principals who are beneficial owners of shares of our common stock.
Shareholder Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting
Shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the next annual meeting of shareholders must be received by the company on or before June 6, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting. These proposals must also comply with the rules of the SEC governing the form and content of proposals in order to be included in Northeast's proxy statement and form of proxy. Any such proposals should be mailed to: Corporate Clerk, Northeast Bancorp, 500 Canal Street, Lewiston, Maine 04240.
A shareholder of record who wishes to present a proposal at the next annual meeting, other than a proposal to be considered for inclusion in Northeast's proxy statement described above, must provide written notice of such proposal and appropriate supporting documentation, as set forth in Northeast's bylaws, to Northeast at its principal executive office no earlier than July 19, 2019 nor later than August 16, 2019; provided, however, that in the event the annual meeting is scheduled to be held on a date more than 30 days before the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting (the "Anniversary Date") or more than 60 days after the Anniversary Date, timely notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the later of (a) the 90th day prior to the scheduled date of such annual meeting or (b) the 10th day following the first date on which the date of such annual meeting is publicly disclosed. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will confer discretionary voting authority with respect to these proposals, subject to SEC rules governing the exercise of this authority. Any such proposal should be mailed to: Corporate Clerk, Northeast Bancorp, 500 Canal Street, Lewiston, Maine 04240.
