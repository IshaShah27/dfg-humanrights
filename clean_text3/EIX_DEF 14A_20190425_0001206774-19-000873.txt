Our Business and Clean Energy Strategy
EIX's core business is conducted by its subsidiary SCE, a rate-regulated electric utility that supplies electric energy to approximately 15 million people in a 50,000 square-mile area of southern California. We are building a modern electricity company that allows customers to take control of their energy consumption by providing safe, smart, flexible, reliable, and affordable services. Our strategy is to grow our core utility business, establish best-in-class operations and pursue growth beyond SCE to provide superior value to our customers and top quartile financial performance to our shareholders. At SCE, we are focused on four strategic priorities as we address the challenges of California wildfires catalyzed by climate change.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Cleaning the power system through continued leadership in procurement of renewable power        Helping customers make cleaner energy choices, including renewable distributed energy resources such as roof top solar, electric transportation, and energy efficiency programs        Strengthening and modernizing the electric grid        Achieving operational and service excellence and doing so safely 
[END TABLE]
This strategy, reviewed and overseen by the Board, is intended to provide a foundation for long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 We remain focused on supporting California's goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and ultimately to reduce emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. We believe in a clean energy future, and are developing smart solutions to society's climate and energy challenges. 
[END TABLE]
More information on our strategy is included in our Annual Report.
Financial Results
Significant financial results for EIX include:
Our stock price and relative TSR have been impacted by California's regulatory and legislative framework for wildfire liability and cost recovery. For more information about our efforts to protect and mitigate against wildfire risk and improve California's framework, see the Company's Annual Report.

ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Corporate Governance
Director Nomination Process
The Governance Committee, comprised solely of independent directors under New York Stock Exchange LLC ("NYSE") rules and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, recommends director candidates to the Board.
The Committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders if they are submitted in writing to the Corporate Secretary and include all of the information required by Article II, Section 4 of our Bylaws plus a written description with any supporting materials of: 
The Committee has retained a director search firm to identify director candidates, coordinate the interview process and conduct reference and background checks. Mr. Trent and Ms. Beliveau-Dunn, who are first-time nominees for election by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting, were recommended by the Committee's director search firm. There are no differences in the manner in which the Committee evaluates a candidate based on the source of the recommendation.
If, based on an evaluation of the candidate's qualifications, qualities and skills, the Committee determines to continue its consideration of a candidate, Committee members interview the candidate. The Committee conducts any further research on the candidate it deems appropriate. The Committee then determines whether to recommend that the candidate be nominated as a director. The Board considers the recommendation and determines whether to nominate the candidate for election.
Board Qualifications and Diversity
For the Governance Committee to recommend a director nominee, the candidate must at a minimum possess the qualifications, qualities and skills in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, including: 
The Committee also considers other factors and information, including the Board's current need for additional members, the candidate's potential for increasing the Board's range of experience, skills and diversity, the candidate's independence, and skills and experience relevant to our business strategy.
Table of Contents
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect the Board's policy that director nominees should reflect diversity of skills, backgrounds, gender and ethnicity. The Committee considers ethnic and gender diversity, and diversity of skills, backgrounds and qualifications represented on the Board, in recommending nominees for election. The Committee has instructed its director search firm to identify candidates reflecting ethnic and gender diversity. The Committee evaluates its effectiveness in achieving diversity on the Board through its annual review of Board composition, which identifies ethnicity, gender and industry experience prior to recommending nominees for election.
In nominating candidates for re-election to the Board, the Committee also considers the nature and time invested in a director's service on other boards, the director's Board, Board committee and annual meeting attendance, and the vote received at the prior annual meeting. The Corporate Governance Guidelines limit a director's service on other boards to three other public company boards.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors should not be nominated for re-election to the Board after reaching age 72 unless there is good cause to extend a director's Board service after reaching age 72.
Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the Board be comprised of at least a majority of independent directors and that the Audit, Compensation, and Governance Committees be comprised entirely of independent directors. The Company uses the NYSE listing standards to determine independence.
Directors serving on the Audit and Compensation Committees must meet additional independence criteria prescribed by the NYSE listing standards and the charters of those Committees. Director Chang serves on the audit committees of the American Funds family, Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated and Transocean Ltd. The Board has determined Ms. Chang's simultaneous service on the audit committees of three other public companies does not impair her ability to effectively serve on our Audit and Finance Committee.
The Board has determined that the relationships described in Section B of Exhibit A-1 to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are on our website at www.edison.com/corpgov, are not material for purposes of determining directors' independence to serve on the Board. The Board does not consider such relationships in making independence determinations.
For relationships not prohibited by NYSE rules and not covered under the categories of immaterial relationships in our Guidelines, the determination of whether a relationship is material or not, and therefore whether a director is independent or not, is made in good faith by the directors. The director whose relationship is under consideration abstains from the vote regarding his or her independence.
The Board has determined that all directors other than Messrs. Pizarro and Payne are independent.
The Board reviews the independence of our directors at least annually, and periodically as needed. On a monthly basis, the Company also monitors director relationships and transactions that might disqualify them as independent. In February 2019, prior to recommending director nominees for election, the Board confirmed that the independent directors had no relationships or transactions that disqualified them as independent.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education
New directors receive information about the Company's business, strategy and management team to familiarize them with the Company before their first Board meeting. The Company also arranges a series of in-person orientation meetings between each new director and senior leaders of our organizational units to help new directors understand the operations/function of each organizational unit as it relates to their specific Board and committee duties.
We provide annual continuing education to directors on specific topics that relate to the Company's strategic priorities. These sessions are led by management and include presentations by external experts and site visits to our facilities. Directors may also attend external education programs and are reimbursed by the Company for the cost of those programs.

ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Board and Committee Evaluation Process
The Governance Committee oversees the annual evaluation of the Board and Board committees, and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the process. In 2018, the Committee retained a third-party facilitator to assist in the Board and committee evaluations. The facilitator conducted individual interviews with each director to elicit feedback, particularly in the following areas:
The facilitator reported to the Board in October 2018. Among other topics, the Board discussed opportunities to enhance Board oversight of strategy and risk, and better align and clarify the responsibilities of the Audit Committee and Finance, Operations and Safety Oversight ("FOSO") Committee. At the request of the Board, the Governance Committee reviewed the charters of the Audit and FOSO Committees to address feedback received during the 2018 Board and committee evaluations. In February 2019, the Governance Committee recommended that the Board amend the Audit Committee and FOSO Committee charters to: (i) move the finance-related responsibilities from the FOSO Committee to the Audit Committee; and (ii) enhance the description of the FOSO Committee's safety oversight responsibilities. On February 28, 2019, the Board amended the charters of the Audit and FOSO Committees to adopt the Governance Committee's recommendations and renamed them the Audit and Finance Committee and the Safety and Operations Committee. See Board Committees below.
The Committee plans to use a third-party facilitator for the Board's evaluation once every three years. In 2019, the Committee plans to use a survey process, with the results to be discussed in executive session during the applicable Board or committee meeting.
Board Leadership Structure
Mr. Sullivan has served as the independent Chair of the EIX Board since 2016. The EIX Board believes separating the Chair and CEO positions is the most appropriate leadership structure for EIX at this time, by allowing Mr. Pizarro to focus on the day-to-day management of the business and on executing our strategic priorities, while allowing Mr. Sullivan to focus on leading the Board, providing advice and counsel to Mr. Pizarro, and facilitating the Board's independent oversight of management. As independent Chair, Mr. Sullivan's duties include:
Table of Contents
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The SCE Bylaws provide that the CEO of SCE has the duties of the Chair unless a separate Chair of the SCE Board is appointed. Since 2016, Mr. Payne has served as SCE CEO and has had the duties of the Chair of the SCE Board. The SCE Board has determined that the current leadership structure is appropriate for SCE as a subsidiary of EIX. All directors of SCE are independent, except for Messrs. Payne and Pizarro, and all Board committees are composed entirely of independent directors.
CEO Succession Planning
The Board believes CEO succession planning is one of its most important responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will annually review and evaluate succession planning and management development for the Company's senior officers, including the CEO.
At least annually, the Board meets in executive session with the EIX CEO to discuss talent and succession planning. The discussion includes CEO succession in the ordinary course, CEO succession if an emergency occurs, and succession for other key senior management positions. The frequency of the Board's CEO succession planning discussions depends in part on the period of time until the CEO's expected retirement.
In the succession planning process, internal CEO succession candidates are identified and evaluated based on criteria considered predictive of success at the CEO level, considering the Company's business strategy. The Board uses a common talent assessment format for each individual. The assessment includes a development plan for each individual.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will have opportunities to become acquainted with the senior officers of the Company and others who may have the potential to handle significant management positions. This is carried out through opportunities for officers to make presentations to the Board and Board committees, director education sessions, other business interactions, and social events intended for this purpose.
Strategy Oversight
The Board is regularly engaged in providing management with strategic direction, including but not limited to opportunities in clean energy, efficient electrification, strengthening and modernizing the electric grid, and customer choice. The Board's oversight and review of Company strategy occurs through annual in-depth strategy meetings, annual education sessions on strategic topics with external experts, regular updates at Board meetings, and discussion of emerging issues affecting strategy. Directors with particular expertise in a strategic area also advise management on strategy outside of Board meetings. In 2018, the Board education sessions on strategic topics focused on artificial intelligence and digital transformation.

ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Risk Oversight
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that one of the Board's primary functions is to review the Company's enterprise risk management process and monitor strategic and emerging risks. The Board monitors key risks through reports and discussions regarding key risk areas at Board meetings. The Board also focuses on specific strategic and emerging risks in periodic strategy reviews. The Board annually reviews corporate goals and approves capital budgets. Board committees have responsibility for risk oversight in specific areas as follows:

ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Safety Oversight
The Board believes the safety of employees, contractors and the public is essential to the Company's values and success. The Board and its Safety and Operations Committee maintain joint responsibility for safety oversight at the Company. The Board and Safety and Operations Committee receive regular safety reports that help provide direction and guidance to management regarding the Company's safety programs, policies and practices relating to the Company's safety culture, goals, risks and significant incidents. The Safety and Operations Committee also receives a safety update at each meeting that includes performance metrics, reporting on serious incidents, and actions to improve employee and contractor safety. The Chair of the Safety and Operations Committee then provides a safety report to the Board at its next meeting. In addition, as discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis below, the Compensation Committee has made safety a foundational goal that can negatively impact annual incentive compensation of our executives.
Cybersecurity Oversight
The Company has identified cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk. Cyber risks are included in the key risk reports to the Audit and Finance Committee discussed above. In addition, the Board has assigned primary responsibility for cybersecurity oversight to the Safety and Operations Committee, which receives cybersecurity updates with each meeting that focus on cybersecurity threats, defenses, and data analytics that impact the Company's most critical assets. In 2018, the Board also received a report on the Company's evolving approach to the identification and mitigation of cyber risks.
The Company has established a cybersecurity oversight group comprised of a multidisciplinary senior management team to provide governance and strategic direction for the identification, protection and detection of cybersecurity risks to the Company. Director Tauscher serves as the Board liaison to the oversight group and regularly attends meetings. Other Board members are expected to attend at least one meeting annually.
ESG Oversight
The Board oversees climate change and other ESG risks and opportunities as an integral part of its strategy oversight responsibility, which includes annual in-depth strategy meetings and regular updates at Board meetings. Board committees comprised entirely of independent directors have responsibility for risk and operational oversight of specific ESG-related issues as outlined below. In addition, several directors have participated in leadership and employee resource group programs to support the Company's diversity and inclusion initiatives.

Shareholder Engagement
We regularly seek and value input from our shareholders. Each year we reach out to our major institutional shareholders to discuss the Company's corporate governance, executive compensation, and business strategy. In the last year, we have engaged with shareholders holding approximately 30% of EIX Common Stock on various issues, including:
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
Within five years from their initial election to the Board, directors must own an aggregate number of shares of EIX Common Stock or derivative securities convertible into EIX Common Stock, excluding stock options, having a value equivalent to five times the annual Board retainer. All deferred stock units held by a director count toward this ownership requirement. All directors comply with this stock ownership requirement.
Table of Contents
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Director Meeting Attendance
The Board met eight times in 2018. Each director attended at least 90% of all Board and Board committee meetings he or she was eligible to attend. The Board held six executive sessions of the independent directors.
Director nominees are expected to attend Annual Meetings. All EIX and SCE director nominees attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
Proxy Access for Director Elections
In 2015, the EIX Board adopted proxy access for director elections at annual meetings. The EIX Bylaws provide that the Company will include in its Proxy Statement up to two nominees (or nominees for up to 20% of the EIX Board, whichever is greater) submitted by a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders owning at least 3% of EIX common stock continuously for at least three years, if the shareholder group and nominee satisfy the requirements in Article II, Section 13 of the EIX Bylaws, which are available at www.edison.com/corpgov. The EIX Board made this decision after careful consideration of feedback received from our engagement with shareholders regarding proxy access.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
The Governance Committee reviews at least annually, and periodically as needed, any transaction in the prior calendar year or any proposed transaction between the EIX companies and a related person in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and the related person has a material interest. A related person is a director, a director nominee, an executive officer, or a greater than 5% beneficial owner of any class of voting securities of EIX or SCE, and their immediate family members. This policy is stated in writing in the Committee's charter.
The Committee's regular procedure is to obtain from management annually, and periodically as needed, a list of the transactions with related persons described above, and to review these transactions at a meeting held before recommending director nominations to the Board. The list is based on information from questionnaires completed by our directors, director nominees, and executive officers, together with information obtained from our accounts payable and receivable records, and is reviewed by legal counsel. The Committee's procedure is evidenced in the minutes and records for the Committee meeting at which the review occurred.
In 2018, Director Linda Stuntz was an equity partner at the law firm of Stuntz, Davis & Staffier, P.C. ("SD&S"), which paid the Company approximately $141,000 in 2018 to sublease office space in Washington, D.C. The Company's sublease of office space to SD&S began before Ms. Stuntz joined the Board. Ms. Stuntz retired from SD&S effective December 31, 2018 and is no longer affiliated with the firm.
Policy on Shareholder Rights Plans
The EIX Board has a policy to seek prior shareholder approval of the adoption of any shareholder rights plan unless, due to time constraints or other reasons consistent with the EIX Board's fiduciary duties, a committee consisting solely of independent directors determines that it would be in the best interests of EIX shareholders to adopt the plan prior to shareholder approval. Any rights plan adopted by the EIX Board without prior shareholder approval will automatically terminate one year after adoption of the plan unless the plan is approved by EIX shareholders prior to such termination.
Applicability of Stock Exchange Rules to SCE
EIX is subject to NYSE rules and SCE is subject to NYSE MKT LLC rules, which exempt SCE from designated corporate governance rules for Board and Board committee composition, including director independence, the director nominations process, and the process to determine executive compensation.
SCE is exempt from these rules because (i) it is a "controlled company" with over 50% of the voting power held by its parent company, EIX, and (ii) it has listed only preferred stock on the exchange. However, SCE closely follows the EIX corporate governance practices required under the NYSE rules.

The Board occasionally creates special Board committees to focus on certain topics.
As described above, the Governance Committee reviewed the charters of the Audit and FOSO Committees to address feedback received during the 2018 Board and committee evaluations. Based on the Governance Committee's recommendation, on February 28, 2019, the Board amended the Audit Committee and FOSO Committee charters to: (i) move the finance-related responsibilities from the FOSO Committee to the Audit Committee; and (ii) enhance the description of the FOSO Committee's safety oversight responsibilities. Effective February 28, 2019, the Audit Committee became the Audit and Finance Committee and the FOSO Committee became the Safety and Operations Committee.

Director Compensation
The following table presents information regarding the compensation paid for 2018 to our non-employee directors. The compensation paid to any director who is also an employee of EIX or SCE is presented in the EIX and SCE Summary Compensation Tables and the related explanatory tables.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE – FISCAL YEAR 2018
Table of Contents
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Annual Retainer and Meeting Fees
Compensation for non-employee directors during 2018 included an annual retainer, fees for attending certain meetings, and an annual equity award. Directors were offered the opportunity to receive all of their compensation on a deferred basis under the EIX Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The following table sets forth the cash retainers and meeting fees paid to directors in 2018:
All directors are also reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for serving as directors and are eligible to participate in the Director Matching Gift Program described in footnote (5) to the Director Compensation Table above.
Annual Equity Awards
Upon re-election to the Board on April 26, 2018, non-employee directors were granted an annual equity award of EIX Common Stock or deferred stock units with an aggregate grant date value of $140,000. The Board approved increasing the annual equity award to $152,500 or a prorated portion thereof (as explained below), effective for initial elections or re-elections to the Board on or after October 1, 2018.
Upon his re-appointment as Chair of the EIX Board on April 26, 2018, Mr. Sullivan was granted a supplemental annual equity award of EIX Common Stock or deferred stock units with an aggregate grant date value of $62,500. The Board approved increasing the supplemental annual equity award to $75,000 or a prorated portion thereof (as explained below), effective for the initial appointment or re-appointment of a non-employee director as Chair of the EIX Board on or after October 1, 2018.
Table of Contents
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
If the grant date of an award for an initial election to the Board or initial appointment as Chair of the EIX Board occurs after the date of EIX's Annual Meeting for that year, then the grant date value of the award is prorated by multiplying it by the following percentage: 75% if the grant date is in the second quarter of the year; 50% if the grant date is in the third quarter of the year; 25% if the grant date is in the fourth quarter of the year. Mr. Trent received a prorated initial election award on October 25, 2018 with a grant date value equal to 25% of $152,500. If the grant date of an award for an initial election to the Board occurs in 2019 before the 2019 Annual Meeting, the director receives an annual equity award upon election in the amount of $152,500, but is not eligible to receive an additional annual equity award upon reelection at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Ms. Beliveau-Dunn received an initial election award on February 28, 2019 with a grant date value of $152,500 and will not receive an additional equity award if she is reelected at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
The number of shares or units granted is determined by dividing the grant date value of the equity award by the closing price of EIX Common Stock on the grant date and rounding up to the next whole share. Each award is fully vested when granted.
The annual equity award for an initial election to the Board is made in the form of deferred stock units. For re-election awards and the additional equity award for appointment or re-appointment as Chair of the EIX Board, directors have the opportunity to elect in advance to receive such awards entirely in EIX Common Stock, entirely in deferred stock units, or in any combination of the two. A deferred stock unit is a contractual right to receive one share of EIX Common Stock. Deferred stock units are credited to the director's account under the EIX Director Deferred Compensation Plan described below. Deferred stock units cannot be voted or sold. They accrue dividend equivalents on the ex-dividend date, if and when dividends are declared on EIX Common Stock. The accrued dividend equivalents are converted to additional deferred stock units.
Each director's equity award in 2018 was granted under the EIX 2007 Performance Incentive Plan. Directors serving on both Company Boards receive only one award per year for election to the Boards.
EIX Director Deferred Compensation Plan
Non-employee directors are eligible to defer up to 100% of their retainers and meeting fees. Any portion of a director's annual equity award that he or she elects to receive as deferred stock units is automatically deferred. Amounts deferred (other than deferred stock units) accrue interest until paid to the director at a rate equal to the average monthly Moody's Corporate Bond Yield for Baa Public Utility Bonds over a 60-month period ending September 1 of the prior year.
Any amounts deferred (including deferred stock units) may be deferred until a specified date no later than the date the director turns age 75, or may become payable in connection with the director's retirement, death, disability or other separation from service. Directors have sub-accounts for each annual deferral for which the following forms of payment may be elected:
Payments triggered by retirement, death, disability or other separation from service may begin upon the applicable triggering event or a specified number of months and/or years following the applicable triggering event. However, payments may not begin later than the director's 75th birthday unless the director is still on the Board. Payments are subject to certain administrative earliest payment date rules, and may be delayed or accelerated if permitted or required under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. All amounts payable are treated as obligations of EIX.
Determination of Director Compensation
The Board makes all decisions regarding director compensation. These decisions are normally made after receiving recommendations from the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee makes its recommendations after receiving input from its independent compensation consultant and management. The Compensation Committee retained Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance") to evaluate and make recommendations regarding director compensation for 2018. Pay Governance's assistance included helping the Compensation Committee identify industry trends and norms for director compensation, reviewing and identifying peer group companies, and evaluating director compensation data for these companies. The changes made to director compensation in 2018 were based on analysis and recommendations provided by Pay Governance. Management's input focuses on legal, compliance, and administrative issues.

ITEM 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit and Finance Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Independent Auditor retained to audit the Company's financial statements. The Committee has selected PwC as the Company's Independent Auditor for calendar year 2019. The Company is asking shareholders to ratify this appointment.
PwC is an international accounting firm which provides leadership in public utility accounting matters. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they wish.
PwC has been retained as the Company's Independent Auditor continuously since 2002. The Committee has adopted restrictions on hiring certain persons formerly associated with PwC into an accounting or financial reporting oversight role to help ensure PwC's continuing independence.
The Committee meets annually in executive session without PwC present to evaluate the quality of PwC's audit services and their performance, including PwC's industry knowledge from an accounting and tax perspective, PwC's continued independence and professional skepticism, the Committee's discussions with management about PwC's performance, and information available from Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") inspection reports.
The Committee annually considers whether the Independent Auditor firm should be reappointed for another year. The lead engagement partner is required to rotate off the Company's audit every five years. The Committee is involved in the selection of the lead engagement partner. In 2015, in connection with the mandated rotation of PwC's lead engagement partner effective beginning with PwC's audit of the Company's 2016 financial statements, the Company interviewed candidates who met professional, industry and personal criteria, and selected finalists. The Committee Chair participated in interviews with the finalists and selected the lead engagement partner, in consultation with the Committee.
Table of Contents
ITEM 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Committee considered several factors when determining whether to reappoint PwC as the Company's Independent Auditor, including: 
The Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC to serve as the Company's Independent Auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its investors.
The Company is not required to submit this appointment to a shareholder vote. Ratification would be advisory only. However, if the shareholders of either EIX or SCE do not ratify the appointment, the Committee will investigate the reasons for rejection by the shareholders and will reconsider the appointment.
Independent Auditor Fees
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by PwC to EIX (consolidated total including EIX and its subsidiaries) and SCE, respectively, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:
The Audit and Finance Committee annually approves all proposed audit fees in executive session without PwC present, considering several factors, including a breakdown of the services to be provided, proposed staffing and hourly rates, and changes in the Company and industry from the prior year. The audit fees are the culmination of a process which included a comparison of the prior year's proposed fees to actual fees incurred and fee proposals for known and anticipated 2018 services in the audit, audit-related, tax and other categories. The Committee's deliberations consider balancing the design of an audit scope that will achieve a high quality audit with driving efficiencies from both the Company and PwC while compensating PwC fairly.
The Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services performed by PwC to ensure these services will not impair the firm's independence.
The Committee has delegated to the Committee Chair the authority to pre-approve services between Committee meetings, provided that any pre-approval decisions are presented to the Committee at its next meeting. PwC must assure that all audit and non-audit services provided to the Company have been approved by the Committee.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all services performed by PwC were pre-approved by the Committee, irrespective of whether the services required pre-approval under the Exchange Act.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit and Finance Committee is composed of six independent directors and operates under a charter adopted by the Board, which is posted on our website at www.edison.com/corpgov. The Committee complied with the requirements of its charter in 2018.
The Board has determined that each Committee member is independent and financially literate, and that at least one member has accounting or other related financial management expertise, as such qualifications are defined by NYSE rules, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and/or the Committee charter. The Board has also determined that directors Chang, Morris, Taylor and Trent each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules.
The Committee's key responsibilities are described above under "Board Committees – Audit and Finance Committee." The Audit Committee's role in risk oversight is described above under "Our Corporate Governance – Risk Oversight."
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process, including the integrity and objectivity of the financial statements. The Independent Auditor performs an independent audit of the Company's financial statements under the standards of the PCAOB and issues a report on the financial statements. The Committee monitors and oversees these processes. The Committee members are not accountants or auditors by profession and therefore have relied on certain representations from management and the Independent Auditor in carrying out their responsibilities.
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report to be filed with the SEC.

ITEM 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The advisory vote to approve the Company's executive compensation, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of our named executive officers. This advisory vote is required by SEC rules to be provided at least once every three years. However, our shareholders have voted in favor of holding the advisory vote every year, and the Board determined that it would be held annually. The Company's Say-on-Pay proposal received support from at least 91% of the votes cast in each of the last eight years.
Our executive compensation program is described under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below. We encourage you to read it carefully. Our executive compensation program is reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe our executive compensation structure is competitive, aligns compensation with shareholder value and serves shareholders well.
EIX and SCE request shareholder approval of the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement under the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion that accompanies the compensation tables.
The Company values constructive dialogue with shareholders on compensation and other important governance matters. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Company and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Company. However, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote and any constructive feedback from shareholders when making future executive compensation decisions. See "Compensation Summary – Shareholder Communication and Compensation Program for 2019."
It is expected that the next Say-on-Pay vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes the principles of our executive compensation program, how we applied those principles in compensating our named executive officers ("NEOs") for 2018, and how we use our compensation program to drive performance. We also discuss the roles and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee (the "Committee") in determining executive compensation. The CD&A is organized as follows:
The CD&A contains information relevant to your decision regarding the advisory vote to approve our executive compensation (Item 3 on your Proxy Card). When voting on Item 3, EIX shareholders will vote on EIX executive compensation, while SCE shareholders will vote on SCE executive compensation.
Certain key information about our executive compensation program is highlighted in this Compensation Summary.
Executive Compensation Practices
Our executive compensation program is designed with the objective of strongly linking pay with performance.

CEO Pay Comparison: EIX vs. Peer Group
The following chart shows EIX CEO total direct compensation for each of the last five years as reported in the EIX Summary Compensation Table, compared to the median total direct compensation for the chief executive officers of the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index peer group for such year.(1) "Total direct compensation" or "TDC" means the sum of base salary, the actual annual incentive award paid for the year and the grant date fair value of long-term incentive awards (columns (c), (e), (f) and (g) of the Summary Compensation Table) for the NEO for the year.
Theodore F. Craver, Jr. served as EIX CEO for all of 2014 and 2015, and his TDC is shown in the chart for those years. Mr. Pizarro succeeded Mr. Craver as EIX CEO on September 30, 2016 and his full-year TDC is shown for 2016, 2017, and 2018. (The 2018 Peer Median TDC in the chart is the same as the 2017 Peer Median TDC, since peer group data for 2018 was generally unavailable in time to include in this Proxy Statement.)
Mr. Pizarro's full-year 2016 TDC was significantly below the peer group median for chief executive officers. His compensation before the September 30, 2016 effective date of his election as EIX CEO was targeted at the market median for his prior positions (SCE President through May 31 and EIX President from June 1 through September 29). In addition, the Committee set his annualized compensation after the effective date of his election as EIX CEO significantly below the peer group median for chief executive officers, with an opportunity for increases in subsequent years as the Committee evaluated his performance as EIX CEO. The Committee increased Mr. Pizarro's TDC in 2017, but not to the level of the peer group median.
For 2018, the Committee increased Mr. Pizarro's target TDC to bring it closer to the peer median. However, Mr. Pizarro's actual TDC was significantly below the peer median because, as discussed above, he did not receive an annual incentive award for 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Alignment of EIX CEO Pay with Performance
The Company utilizes annual and long-term incentive awards to align executive pay with performance. The awards provide significant upside and downside potential and help focus executives' attention on our financial, strategic and operating objectives, and shareholder returns.
The following chart shows the alignment over the past five years between the EIX CEO's total direct compensation (presented on the same basis as in the EIX CEO vs. Peer Group Median TDC chart above) and our indexed TSR,(2) which represents the value of an initial investment of $100 in EIX common stock at the beginning of the five-year period, and assumes that dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date.
EIX CEO TDC vs. Indexed TSR 2014-2018  
As the chart above shows, EIX's TSR was approximately 42% for the five-year period from 2014 to 2018. The largest increase in TSR occurred in 2014. That is also the year the EIX CEO's TDC was its peak, primarily because Mr. Craver received a significantly above-target annual incentive award for 2014, largely as a result of above-target core earnings.(3) TSR decreased slightly in 2015, as did Mr. Craver's annual incentive award and TDC.
TSR then increased significantly in 2016 and decreased in 2017 and 2018. As discussed above in "CEO Pay Comparison: EIX vs. Peer Group," Mr. Pizarro's 2016 TDC was relatively low because it was comprised of his compensation as a Company President from January 1 through September 29, 2016 and his initial compensation as EIX CEO from September 30 through December 31, 2016. His 2017 TDC was higher than his 2016 TDC, but still below the peer group median for chief executive officers. His TDC then decreased in 2018 because, as discussed above, he did not receive an annual incentive award for 2018.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Much of the discussion above is focused on annual incentive awards because they are the only portion of total direct compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, that reflects the realized value of the CEO's variable compensation. For long-term incentive awards, the Summary Compensation Table reports only the grant date fair value of the awards granted during the applicable year. The difference between the grant date fair value and the actual value realized at payout can be significant and is due to Company performance, including changes in stock price.
The impact of Company performance on realized value is most clear in performance share payouts. The following chart shows, for the three most-recently completed performance periods, the difference between the grant date fair value of performance shares granted to the EIX CEO (as reported in the Summary Compensation Table) and the actual value realized at payout (determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares paid pursuant to the award by (ii) the closing price of EIX Common Stock on the date the Committee certified performance for the applicable performance period).
EIX CEO Performance Shares – Grant Date Fair Value vs. Realized Value  
For 2014 performance share awards, the realized value at payout was 230% of the grant date fair value. The increased value was due to EIX's strong performance during the performance period, as measured by relative TSR and core earnings per share ("EPS") compared to target. In addition, EIX's stock price appreciated after the grant date of these awards.
In contrast, for 2015 and 2016 performance share awards, the realized value at payout was 61% and 49% of the respective grant date fair values. The values decreased primarily due to the significant impact of the wildfires on EIX's relative TSR and stock price beginning December 2017.
The decline in EIX's stock price has also had a significant impact on the realizable value of EIX stock options. Stock options comprised more than one-third of Mr. Pizarro's 2018 target TDC. Those stock options and all other stock options granted to Mr. Pizarro since 2014 were out of the money on December 31, 2018 (i.e., their per share exercise price was greater than the closing price of a share of EIX Common Stock).
Shareholder Communication and Compensation Program for 2019
As discussed above in the Proxy Summary, we regularly reach out to our major institutional shareholders to discuss the Company's executive compensation, among other issues. Management shares compensation-related feedback with the Compensation Committee, along with proxy advisory firm developments and trends in executive compensation practices.
EIX's Say-on-Pay proposal received support from approximately 92% of the votes cast in 2018. After considering the shareholder support reflected in the vote results, trends in executive compensation, and the best interests of shareholders, the Committee approved maintaining our executive compensation program with no significant changes for 2019.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
We generally target a competitive range of +/-15% around the market median for each element of total direct compensation offered under our program: base salaries, annual cash incentives, and long-term equity-based incentives. The reasons for the Committee's decision to target the competitive range around the median level include: 
A significant portion of our executives' total direct compensation is tied to company performance. The following charts show that incentive compensation comprised approximately 86% of EIX CEO 2018 target total direct compensation and approximately 69% of EIX's and SCE's other NEOs' 2018 target total direct compensation.
This pay mix reflects the Committee's emphasis on strongly linking pay with performance.
Base Salary
For 2018, each NEO's base salary was evaluated according to his or her position and performance. For each position, a market base salary range was determined. The median of the range was the market median level of base salaries for comparable positions. We do not have employment contracts and our NEOs do not have contractual rights to receive fixed base salaries.
The Committee increased the annual base salary rates of Messrs. Pizarro, Payne, Umanoff, Murphy, Petmecky, and Nichols and Ms. Rigatti for 2018 to bring them to, or closer to, the market median base salary for their respective positions. Mr. Swartz's base salary rate was not increased in 2018, but the salary amount paid to him in 2018 was more than in 2017 because his 2017 base salary rate increase became effective March 6, 2017.

Annual Incentive Awards
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan
NEOs are eligible for annual incentive awards under the EIX Executive Incentive Compensation Plan for achieving financial, strategic and operational goals that are established at the beginning of each year and are tied to the key elements of our strategy described on page 1.
The 2018 annual incentive award target value for each NEO was set as a percentage of the NEO's base salary (the "Annual Incentive Target%"). The Committee, after reviewing the market range and median for each position and considering internal equity issues, decided to use the same Annual Incentive Target% it set for each NEO for 2017.
The minimum annual incentive award is $0. The maximum award is 200% of target, which the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, advised is the most prevalent practice among the peer group companies.
The Committee determines annual incentive awards based on corporate and individual performance. The corporate performance factor is based on performance relative to the goals established at the beginning of the year. For each goal category, the Committee assigned a target score and potential score range reflecting the relative weight given that goal category. Specific quantitative targets were set for goals that comprised most of the target score. In February 2019, the Committee determined the score achieved for each goal category, depending on the extent to which the goals were unmet, met or exceeded.
Separate goals were established for EIX and SCE. However, as reflected in the 2018 EIX Corporate Performance Scoring Matrix below, many of EIX's goals related to SCE's performance. The EIX corporate performance factor applies to the annual incentive awards for Messrs. Pizarro, Umanoff, and Murphy and Ms. Rigatti, while the SCE corporate performance factor applies to the annual incentive awards for Messrs. Payne, Petmecky, Nichols, Swartz, and Herrington.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
2018 Annual Incentive Awards
Based on 2018 performance, the corporate performance factors for EIX and SCE were 106% and 102% of target, respectively. These factors were determined by adding the "Actual Scores" in the corporate performance scoring matrices above. The Committee did not exercise its discretion to increase or decrease the corporate performance factor from the amount determined by application of the scoring matrix.
In light of the impact of wildfires on communities within SCE's service territory, the Committee exercised its discretion and decided, in consultation with management and with its full support and agreement, that no annual incentive award would be paid for 2018 to Messrs. Pizarro, Payne, Umanoff, and Nichols and Ms. Rigatti. The Committee's decision was not a reflection on the performance of the Company or the five NEOs.
For the other NEOs, the Committee determined the annual incentive award by multiplying the annual incentive target percentage for the NEO by the EIX or SCE corporate performance factor and an individual performance factor. The determination of the individual performance factors was a two-step process in which the Committee exercised its discretion. First, the Committee established an initial individual performance factor for each NEO receiving an annual incentive award, based on the Committee's assessment of the NEO's overall performance and achievements for the year, and relative impact and contribution to corporate performance compared to executives in similar roles. Then the Committee applied a 10 point deduction to the individual performance factor for certain EIX and SCE officers, including all of the NEOs receiving an annual incentive award. The Committee made this adjustment based on its determination that despite the many accomplishments of management in 2018, foundational safety goals were not met.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The following table shows the annual incentive awards paid to our NEOs as a percentage of salary and as a multiple of target:
Long-Term Incentive Awards
All of our long-term incentives are awarded as equity instruments reflecting, or valued by reference to, EIX Common Stock. They are therefore directly linked to the value provided to EIX shareholders. The equity awards also align executives' interests with the long-term interests of customers by enhancing executives' focus on the Company's long-term goals.
Seventy-five percent (75%) of our long-term equity mix is performance-based: the non-qualified stock options that comprise 50% of each NEO's long-term incentive award value; and the performance shares that comprise 25% of the award value. We believe stock options are performance-based because NEOs will realize value only if the market value of EIX Common Stock appreciates. Long-term incentive awards are made under the EIX 2007 Performance Incentive Plan.
Long-Term Incentive Value
On February 21, 2018, the Committee approved 2018 long-term incentive award target values for the NEOs. Each target value was set as a percentage of base salary (the "Long-Term Incentive Target%"). The Committee also approved the methodology for converting those values into the number of stock options, performance shares, and restricted stock units granted to each NEO on the March 1, 2018 grant date. The grant date value of each award is listed in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" tables below.
For 2018, the Committee increased the Long-Term Incentive Target% for Messrs. Pizarro, Murphy, Nichols, and Herrington and Ms. Rigatti to bring them to, or closer to, the market median for their respective positions.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Stock Options
Each stock option granted may be exercised to purchase one share of EIX Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of a share of EIX Common Stock on the grant date. Options vest over a four-year period, subject to continued employment, with one-fourth of each award vesting and becoming exercisable at the beginning of each year. Options have a ten-year term.
The number of options granted to each NEO was determined by dividing the option award value approved by the Committee for that NEO by the grant date value of an option using a Black-Scholes Merton valuation model based on the same assumptions and principles used to determine the grant date fair value of options generally for purposes of EIX's financial reporting.
Performance Shares
Performance shares reward performance over three years against pre-established relative and absolute metrics. Each performance share awarded is a contractual right to receive one share of EIX Common Stock or its cash equivalent if performance and continued service vesting requirements are satisfied. The actual payout can range from zero to 200% of target performance shares, depending on actual performance against pre-established metrics. The performance share awards provide for reinvested dividend equivalents. For each dividend declared for which the ex-dividend date falls within the performance period and after the date of grant, the NEO will be credited with an additional number of target performance shares having a value equal to the dividend that would have been payable on the target performance shares subject to the award. The performance shares credited as dividend equivalents have the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the original performance shares and are forfeited if the underlying shares are not earned.
A conversion formula is used to determine the number of performance shares awarded to each NEO. For the portion of performance shares subject to the TSR metric discussed below, the award value approved by the Committee is divided by the grant date value of the TSR performance shares using a Standard Monte Carlo simulation model based on the same assumptions and principles used to determine the grant date fair value of performance-based awards generally for purposes of EIX's financial reporting. For the portion of performance shares subject to the earnings per share metric discussed below, the respective award value is converted into a specific number of earnings per share performance shares by dividing the award value by the closing price of a share of EIX Common Stock on the grant date.
Performance shares granted from 2015 through 2018 are payable solely in cash based on the closing price of EIX Common Stock on the date on which the Committee certifies performance for the applicable performance period. Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, NEOs may elect to defer payment of performance shares payable in cash.
Performance Share Awards: TSR Metric
Two metrics are used to measure performance share payouts, with each metric weighted 50%. The first performance metric is based on the percentile ranking of EIX's TSR for the three-year performance period beginning January 1 in the year of grant compared to the TSR of each company in the Philadelphia Utility Index at the end of the performance period. The following table provides the percentile ranking and corresponding payout levels:
If EIX achieves a TSR ranking between the 25th percentile and the 50th percentile or between the 50th percentile and the 75th percentile, the number of shares paid will be interpolated on a straight-line basis with discrete intervals at every 5th percentile. To determine performance share payouts, TSR is calculated using the difference between (i) the average closing stock price for the stock for the 20 trading days ending with the last NYSE trading day preceding the first day of the performance period and (ii) the average closing stock price for the stock for the 20 trading days ending with the last trading day of the performance period, and assumes all dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
EIX's three-year TSR from 2016-2018 ranked in the 5th percentile of the comparison group under the methodology used to calculate TSR for performance shares. Since this performance was below the threshold for a payout, there was no payout from the TSR performance shares granted in 2016.
Performance Share Awards: EPS Metric
The second performance metric is based on EIX's three-year average annual core earnings(5) per share, measured against target levels. The Committee establishes the EPS target for each calendar year in February of that year.
The performance multiple for a calendar year is based on EIX's actual EPS performance for that year as a percentage of the EPS target for that year, in accordance with the following table:
If EIX's EPS for a year as a percentage of target EPS is between 80% and 100% or between 100% and 120%, the EPS performance multiple is interpolated on a straight-line basis, with discrete intervals at every 4th percentage point. The EPS performance multiples achieved for each calendar year in the three-year performance period are averaged, and the resulting average determines the performance share payout as a multiple of target.
In February 2019, the Committee certified the following EPS performance multiples for the three calendar years in the performance period for the 2016 grant:
Since the average of the EPS performance multiples for 2016, 2017, and 2018 was 1.13x, EPS performance shares granted in 2016 paid out at 113% of target.
Restricted Stock Units
Each restricted stock unit awarded is a contractual right to receive one share of EIX Common Stock after the vesting requirement of three years of continued service is satisfied. The restricted stock units for NEOs provide for reinvested dividend equivalents. For each dividend declared for which the ex-dividend date falls within the vesting period, the NEO will be credited with an additional number of restricted stock units having a value equal to the dividend that would have been payable on the number of restricted stock units subject to the award. The restricted stock units credited as dividend equivalents have the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the original restricted stock units and are forfeited if the underlying units do not vest.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The restricted stock units are paid in EIX Common Stock, except EIX converts awards to cash having a value equal to the stock that otherwise would have been delivered to satisfy tax withholding and governmental levies. The Committee may elect to pay any restricted stock units in cash rather than shares of EIX Common Stock if and to the extent that payment in shares would exceed the applicable share limits of the EIX 2007 Performance Incentive Plan.
The number of restricted stock units granted to each NEO was determined by dividing the award value approved by the Committee for that NEO by the closing price of a share of EIX Common Stock on the grant date. At payout, NEOs realize an increase or decrease in value (compared to the grant date value) commensurate with the increase or decrease in value realized by shareholders from changes in the stock price and dividends over the three-year vesting period.
Special Vesting of Long-Term Equity
If an NEO terminates employment after reaching age 65, or age 61 with five years of service, (i) stock options will vest and continue to become exercisable as scheduled, (ii) performance shares will be retained with vesting based on the applicable performance metrics, and (iii) restricted stock units will vest and become payable as scheduled; in each instance, as though the NEO's employment had continued through the vesting period and subject to a pro-rated reduction if the NEO retires within the year of grant. Messrs. Nichols and Swartz would be eligible for these special vesting provisions upon retirement. If an NEO dies or becomes disabled while employed, stock options and restricted stock units will immediately vest and become exercisable and payable, respectively, and performance shares will be retained, with vesting based on the applicable performance metrics.
Role of Compensation Committee and Executive Officers
The Committee is responsible for reviewing and determining the compensation paid to executive officers. The Committee annually reviews all components of compensation for our CEO and other executive officers, including base salary and annual and long-term incentives. The Committee also reviews significant benefits, including retirement and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.
Each February, the Committee sets the base salary and the target and maximum potential annual and long-term incentive award values for the current year for each executive officer. At that time, the Committee also determines annual incentive awards for the prior year and performance share payouts for the prior performance period. Base salary changes are generally effective between mid-February and early March of each year.
For the February Committee meeting, the EIX CEO provides recommendations regarding the compensation of other executive officers. Executive officers other than the EIX CEO participate in developing and reviewing executive compensation recommendations, but do not participate in recommendations regarding their own compensation.
The Committee evaluates the EIX CEO's performance relative to goals and determines his compensation in executive session without the EIX CEO present. The Committee Chair reports to the Board in an independent director executive session regarding the compensation determination.
Except as otherwise noted, the Committee's executive officer compensation determinations are subjective and the result of the Committee's business judgment, which is informed by the experiences of the Committee members and input from the Committee's independent compensation consultant.
For newly-hired, promoted, or relocated SCE executive officers who are not also EIX executive officers, the Committee authorized the EIX CEO and the EIX Senior Vice President, Human Resources to jointly make certain compensation decisions within limits pre-approved by the Committee.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Tally Sheets
The Committee periodically reviews tally sheets for EIX NEOs. Tally sheets provide the Committee with information about the following components of compensation, including compensation paid over the preceding three calendar years:
The tally sheets also provide the amounts payable in the event of voluntary or involuntary separation from service, death or disability, or a change in control resulting in termination.
The Committee also reviews additional information regarding long-term incentives, including stock program statistics on share usage, analysis of current exercise values of prior option grants, and a summary of current and past performance share results.
Role of the Committee's Independent Compensation Consultant
The Committee retained Pay Governance to assist in evaluating executive officer compensation for 2018; however, the Committee decides our executive officers' compensation. This assistance included helping the Committee identify industry trends and norms for executive compensation; reviewing and identifying appropriate peer group companies and pay surveys; and evaluating executive compensation data for these companies.
During 2018, Pay Governance provided the following services:
In addition, a Pay Governance representative attended Committee meetings and communicated directly with the Committee as needed. Pay Governance did not perform any services for the Company in 2018 unrelated to the Committee's responsibilities for our compensation programs, and all interactions by the consultants with management were related to their work for the Committee and conducted in accordance with the directions of the Committee or its Chair.
The Committee retains sole authority to hire its compensation consultant, approve its compensation, determine the nature and scope of its services, evaluate its performance, and terminate its engagement. Pursuant to SEC rules, the Committee assessed and determined that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the engagement of Pay Governance as the Committee's compensation consultant.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Use of Competitive Data
The Committee generally targets a competitive range of +/-15% around the market median for comparable positions for each element of total direct compensation. For 2018, the Committee used peer group data and data from pay surveys by Willis Towers Watson to determine the "market median."
The Committee used the companies in the Philadelphia Utility Index in 2018 as the peer group for benchmarking performance and comparing NEO compensation for 2018. The Philadelphia Utility Index has been used by the Committee as the basis for the peer group since 2005. Use of an established market index for peer group purposes is consistent with the way investors evaluate performance across companies within an industry.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 PEER GROUP COMPANIES - PHILADELPHIA UTILITY INDEX 
[END TABLE]
EIX is near the peer group median in revenues and market capitalization. For the four quarters ending September 30, 2018, EIX had revenues of $12.9 billion compared to the peer group median of $12.3 billion (ranking 9th out of the 20 companies in the peer group), based on reported revenues. As of December 31, 2018, EIX's market capitalization was $18.5 billion compared to the peer group median of $20.3 billion (ranking 13th out of 20).
As part of the process of setting 2018 target total direct compensation for NEOs, Pay Governance provided the Committee with benchmarking data from peer group proxy statements. In addition, the Committee received base salary, target annual incentive, and target long-term incentive grant value data from the Willis Towers Watson 2017 Energy Services and the Willis Towers Watson 2017 General Industry pay surveys. The pay survey data included compensation information from utilities, other energy companies, and companies in other industries with comparable revenues, in order to reflect the range of the Company's competitors for executive talent and provide a robust set of information to make compensation decisions. The pay survey data was presented to the Committee in aggregated form. The Committee does not consider the identities of the individual companies in the survey data to be material for its decision-making process, and the individual companies were not provided to the Committee.
The components of the market data and the relative weighting used to calculate a market median varied for each NEO position, based on the availability of sufficient comparative data for the position, and were reviewed by Pay Governance. Market median levels for 2018 were projected from available data with input from Pay Governance.
The Committee exercises its judgment in setting each executive officer's compensation levels within the competitive range described above, and may time to time vary from the competitive range, after taking into account the executive officer's experience, time in position, individual performance, internal equity, retention concerns, or other factors it considers relevant under the circumstances.
Risk Considerations
Our executive compensation policy directs that our total compensation structure should not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking. The Committee takes risk into consideration when reviewing and approving executive compensation.
As specified in its charter, and with the assistance of Pay Governance and Company management, the Committee reviewed the Company's compensation programs for executives and for employees generally and has concluded these programs do not create risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In concluding that the current executive compensation program does not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, the Committee noted the following characteristics that limit risk:
Post-Employment Benefits
The NEOs receive retirement benefits under qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit and defined-contribution retirement plans. The SCE Retirement Plan and the 401(k) Plan are both qualified retirement plans in which the NEOs participate on substantially the same terms as other participating employees.
Due to limitations imposed by ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits payable to the NEOs under the SCE Retirement Plan and the 401(k) Plan are limited. The Executive Retirement Plan and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provide for our NEOs to receive some of the benefits that would be paid under the qualified plans but for such limitations, and certain additional benefits. The Committee believes these programs help us to attract and retain qualified executives.
For descriptions of the tax-qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, see the narrative to the "Pension Benefits" and "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" tables, respectively.
The Company also sponsors a disability benefit plan in which the NEOs were eligible to participate in 2018.
Severance and Change in Control Benefits
Our policy regarding severance protection for NEOs stems from its importance in retaining and recruiting executives. Executives have attractive opportunities with other companies or are recruited from well-compensated positions in other companies. We believe offering one year's worth of compensation and benefits if any officer is involuntarily severed without cause provides financial security to offset the risk of leaving another company or foregoing an opportunity with another company. Severance benefits are not offered for resignation for "good reason," except if a "change in control" occurs (these terms are defined in the Severance Plan).
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The current executive compensation plans offer additional benefits if a change in control of EIX occurs. We believe the occurrence, or expected occurrence, of a change-in-control transaction would create uncertainty regarding continued employment for NEOs. This uncertainty would result from the fact that many change-in-control transactions result in significant organizational changes, particularly at the senior executive level.
To encourage the NEOs to remain employed with the Company during a time when their prospects for continued employment following the change in control would be uncertain, and to permit them to remain focused on the Company's interests, NEOs are provided with enhanced severance benefits if their employment is actually or constructively terminated without cause within a defined period of time around a change in control of EIX. Constructive termination (or a resignation for "good reason") would include occurrences such as a material diminution in duties or salary, or a substantial relocation.
Given that none of the NEOs has an employment agreement that provides for fixed positions or duties, or for a fixed base salary or annual incentive award, we believe a constructive termination severance trigger is needed to prevent an acquirer from having an incentive to constructively terminate an NEO's employment to avoid paying any severance benefits. We do not provide excise tax gross-ups on change-in-control severance benefits for any of our executives. We do not believe NEOs should be entitled to receive their cash severance benefits merely because a change-in-control transaction occurs. Therefore, the payment of cash severance benefits is subject to a double-trigger where an actual or constructive termination of employment must also occur before payment.
However, if a change in control occurs where EIX is not the surviving corporation, and following the transaction, outstanding equity awards would not be continued or assumed, then NEOs and other holders of awards under our equity incentive plan would receive immediate vesting of their outstanding equity awards as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
We believe it is appropriate to fully vest equity awards in change-in-control situations where EIX is not the surviving corporation and the equity awards are not assumed, whether or not employment is terminated, because such a transaction ends the NEOs' ability to realize any further value with respect to the equity awards.
For detailed information on the estimated potential payments and benefits payable to NEOs if they terminate employment, including following a change in control of the Company, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
Perquisites
No perquisites were provided for our NEOs in 2018.
Tax-Deductibility
Federal income tax law generally prohibits a publicly-held company from deducting compensation paid to a current or former NEO that exceeds $1 million during the tax year. Certain awards granted under the EIX 2007 Performance Incentive Plan before November 2, 2017 that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures set by the Committee, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1 million deductibility limit. There can be no assurance that any compensation the Committee intended to be deductible will in fact be deductible.
Although the potential deductibility of compensation is one of the factors the Committee generally considers when designing the Company's executive compensation program, the Committee has the flexibility to take any compensation-related actions it determines are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, including awarding compensation that will not be deductible for tax purposes.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To underscore the importance of linking executive and shareholder interests, the Company has stock ownership guidelines that require Vice Presidents and more senior officers to own EIX Common Stock or equivalents in an amount ranging from one to six times their annual base salary. The stock ownership guidelines for NEOs are as follows: 
The NEOs are expected to achieve their ownership targets within five years from the date they became subject to the guidelines. EIX Common Stock owned outright, shares held in the 401(k) Plan, and vested and unvested restricted stock units which do not depend on performance measures are included in determining compliance with the guidelines. Shares that NEOs may acquire through the exercise or payout of stock options and performance shares are not included in determining compliance until the options or performance shares are exercised, or paid, as the case may be, and the shares are acquired. Based on ownership as of March 4, 2019, all of the NEOs are in compliance with these guidelines.
The guidelines provide that an officer subject to the guidelines may not sell EIX Common Stock acquired pursuant to an EIX long-term incentive award ("Acquired Stock") if the officer does not meet his or her ownership requirement under the guidelines. An officer whose ownership satisfies the guidelines may not sell Acquired Stock to the extent the sale would cause his or her ownership to fall below the applicable guideline level. These transfer limitations do not apply to transfers to satisfy the exercise price of an EIX stock option or to satisfy tax obligations with respect to an EIX long-term incentive award. Exceptions to the guidelines may be approved on a case-by-case basis.
Hedging and Pledging Policy
Under the Company's Insider Trading Policy, hedging related to Company securities, including EIX shares, is prohibited for all directors and employees, including NEOs. In addition, directors, executive officers, and Vice Presidents and more senior officers who report directly to the EIX or SCE CFO may not pledge Company securities as collateral for loans.
Clawback Policy
The Company maintains an incentive compensation clawback policy that allows the Board or the Committee to recoup incentive compensation if the Company restates its financial statements. The policy applies to cash or equity-based incentive compensation to current and former EIX and SCE NEOs and other executive officers that is paid, granted, vested or accrued in any fiscal year within the three-year period preceding the filing of the restatement. The policy allows recoupment of the difference between the incentive compensation paid, granted, vested or accrued under the original results and the incentive compensation that would have been paid, granted, vested or accrued under the restated results. The policy can be enforced by reducing or cancelling outstanding and future incentive compensation, and by a claim for repayment.
The SEC and NYSE have been expected to provide rules requiring public companies to adopt clawback policies to recover incentive compensation overpayments from executive officers under certain conditions involving accounting restatements. If and when this guidance is received, the Committee or the Board will review the existing clawback policy and determine whether changes are needed.

Option Exercises and Stock Vested
The following tables present information regarding the exercise of stock options by the EIX and SCE NEOs and vesting of stock awards during 2018. The stock awards listed in the following tables represent the value realized on the vesting of restricted stock units during 2018, and the value realized on the vesting of 2016 performance share awards payable for the 2016-2018 performance period. The value realized on the vesting of the 2016 performance share awards reflects a payout of approximately 57% of the target number of shares. This below-target payout was due to EIX's TSR ranking in the 5th percentile of its comparison group for the performance period, resulting in zero payout of TSR Performance Shares granted in 2016. EIX's EPS exceeded its target for each year in the performance period by approximately 1%, 9%, and 3% respectively, resulting in a payout of 113% of the target number of EPS Performance Shares granted in 2016.

SCE Retirement Plan
The SCE Retirement Plan is a non-contributory defined-benefit pension plan subject to ERISA. The Retirement Plan was a traditional final average pay plan with a Social Security offset until April 1, 1999, when for most participants a transition to cash balance features was adopted. Employees hired on or after December 31, 2017 are not eligible to participate in the plan.
Form of Payment
Eligible participants may elect a lump sum, life annuity, joint and survivor annuity (if married), or a contingent annuity. For married participants, payment in a joint and 50% survivor annuity is the automatic form of benefit, absent an alternative election. The Company pays the cost of the spousal survivor annuity benefit. For single participants, the single life annuity option is the automatic payment method. Participants can choose to start receiving benefit payments after separation from service or can effectively defer commencement of payments until age 70-1/2.
Cash Balance Benefits
Eligible employees have cash balance accounts that earn interest monthly based on the third segment rate of a corporate bond yield curve specified by the Internal Revenue Service for the month of August preceding the plan year.
Eligible employees of participating companies also earn a monthly pay credit ranging from 3% to 9% of base pay, depending on the number of age plus service "points" the participant has earned. The pay credits are received for each month the participant has an hour of service with the participating company. An additional credit of $150 per month is applied each month to the cash balance account of each participant who is eligible to receive a pay credit for that month.
Grandfathered Benefits
Eligible participants (at least age 50 or with 60 combined age and service points as of March 31, 1999) are considered "grandfathered" and accrue benefits under prior plan formulas.
Upon separation, the grandfathered participant will be eligible to receive the greater of the benefit calculated under the prior plan formulas (offset by any profit sharing account balance in the 401(k) Plan) or the value of the new cash balance account.
An actuarial reduction of the normal age 65 benefit applies if a grandfathered participant either terminates prior to age 55 and commences benefits prior to age 65, or retires and commences benefits after attaining age 55 but prior to age 61. The pension benefit commencing at age 55 for an employee terminating prior to age 55 with at least five years of service is 53.6% of the normal age 65 benefit, while the pension benefit commencing at age 55 for an employee retiring at age 55 with at least five years of service is 77% of the normal age 65 benefit. Lesser early retirement reductions are applied for benefit commencement after age 55 but prior to age 61. An unreduced early retirement benefit is available from age 61 through age 64.
No NEO is eligible for grandfathered benefits under the SCE Retirement Plan.
Vesting
Full vesting occurs after three years of service, upon attainment of age 65, or upon death while employed.
Executive Retirement Plan
The Executive Retirement Plan is an unfunded benefit plan permitted by ERISA and designed to allow NEOs and other executives to receive benefits that would be paid under the SCE Retirement Plan or 401(k) Plan but for limitations under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, and certain additional benefits. As part of the 2008 Internal Revenue Code Section 409A amendments, the Executive Retirement Plan was separated into two plan documents. The grandfathered plan document applies to benefits accrued, determined and vested prior to January 1, 2005, while the 2008 plan document applies to benefits accrued, determined or vested on or after January 1, 2005.
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Eligibility and Vesting
Company executives, including the NEOs, are eligible to participate in the Executive Retirement Plan. Benefits vest after five years of service, upon death or disability, or upon becoming eligible for severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
Final Average Pay Benefit Formula Prior to 2018
Executives who participated in the Executive Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 2018 accrued an age 65 benefit calculated using the following final average pay formula: 
(1.75% x Total Compensation for each year up to 30 years) + (1% x Total Compensation for each year over 30 years). 
Total Compensation is the NEO's base salary and annual incentive award earned in the 36 consecutive months when the total of these payments was the highest (the 36 months need not be consecutive for those grandfathered in the provisions effective prior to 2008).
Because he was a senior executive prior to January 1, 2006, Mr. Pizarro accrued an additional service percentage of 0.75% per year for his first ten years of service.
The actual benefit payable is reduced and offset by (i) all amounts payable under the SCE Retirement Plan described above, (ii) up to 40% of the executive's primary Social Security benefits and (iii) the value of 401(k) Plan accounts derived from the Company's profit sharing contributions, if any.
Executive Retirement Account Formula for New Executives
The Committee changed the Executive Retirement Plan benefit effective January 1, 2018 in order to simplify the plan for new executives and decrease the portion of executives' compensation and benefits packages not tied directly to performance. An individual who first participates in the plan on or after January 1, 2018 will not receive a final average pay benefit. Instead, the individual's Executive Retirement Plan benefit will be based on the total credits in his or her Executive Retirement Account ("ERA"). Executives first participating in the Executive Retirement Plan on or after January 1, 2018 receive the following ERA credits: (i) ERA Salary Credits equal to 12% of the differential between the executive's actual salary for a year and the executive's earnings taken into account for purposes of determining deferrals under the 401(k) Plan for that year (unless the executive was employed as a non-executive by the Company prior to 2018 and is receiving cash balance credits under the SCE Retirement Plan, in which case the ERA Salary Credits are calculated in the same manner as described in Benefit Formula for Continuing Executives below); (ii) 12% of the executive's annual incentive paid under the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, beginning with the annual incentive for 2018 ("ERA Bonus Credits"); and (iii) interest on the ERA balance based on the average monthly Moody's Corporate Bond Yield for Baa Public Utility Bonds over a sixty-month period preceding September 1 of the prior year ("ERA Interest Credits"). EIX may change the interest rate for ERA Interest Credits on a prospective basis for all plan participants.
Benefit Formula for Continuing Executives
Individuals who participated in the Executive Retirement Plan prior to 2018 and were executives on January 1, 2018 will receive a benefit that is the lesser of: (i) the lump sum value of the final average pay benefit determined as described above in Final Average Pay Benefit Formula Prior to 2018 (determined taking into account service before and after January 1, 2018); or (ii) the sum of (x) the lump sum value of the final average pay benefit determined as described above in Final Average Pay Benefit Formula Prior to 2018 but substituting 1% for 1.75% and 0.5% for 1% in the final average pay benefit formula as to years of service accrued after 2017 and (y) the total credits in the participant's Executive Retirement Account. Executives who participated in the Executive Retirement Plan prior to 2018 received the following ERA credits for 2018: (i) ERA Salary Credits equal to 12% of the amount (if any) by which the executive's actual 2018 salary exceeded the compensation limit for 2018 set by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code; (ii) ERA Bonus Credits; and (iii) ERA Interest Credits. The aggregate benefit under the Executive Retirement Plan (i.e., totaling the final average pay benefit, if applicable, and the ERA benefit) is expected to be reduced for most executives and will be unchanged for the rest.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Severance Benefit
If an NEO becomes entitled to severance benefits under the EIX 2008 Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"), or any successor plan, the NEO will receive additional service and age credits for purposes of the final average pay benefit and/or additional ERA credits, as applicable, to calculate the NEO's benefit under the Executive Retirement Plan as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. These severance benefit protections are provided to attract and retain qualified executives.
Payment
Benefits that become payable under the grandfathered plan document are generally payable as follows. Upon a vested participant's retirement at or after age 55 or death, the normal form of benefit is a life annuity, paid monthly, with a 50% spousal survivor benefit following the death of the participant (if the surviving spouse is more than five years younger than the participant, the spousal benefit will be reduced to an amount less than 50% of the pre-death benefit to account for the longer projected payout period). The Company pays the cost of this spousal survivor benefit. A contingent annuity benefit for a survivor other than a spouse is also available, but without company subsidy.
Participants may elect to receive an alternative form of benefit, such as a lump-sum payment or monthly payments over 60 or 120 months. If the participant's employment terminates for any reason other than death, retirement, permanent and total disability, or involuntary termination not for cause, vested benefits will be paid after the participant attains age 55 in an annuity only. If a participant's employment is terminated for cause, all benefits will be forfeited.
Benefits that become payable under the 2008 plan document are generally payable as follows. Participants have sub-accounts for each annual accrual for which the following forms of payment may be elected: single lump-sum; two to fifteen annual installments; monthly installments for 60, 120, or 180 months; a life annuity with a 50% spousal survivor benefit following the participant's death; or a contingent annuity. Participants may elect to have their designated form of payment triggered by their retirement, death, disability or other separation from service; however, payment will not occur before a participant reaches age 55 other than in the case of death or disability.
Payments triggered by retirement, death, disability or other separation from service may begin upon the applicable triggering event, the later of the applicable triggering event and a specific month and year, or a specified number of months and/or years, following the applicable triggering event; however, payments generally may not begin later than the participant's 75th birthday unless the participant is still employed. Payments may be delayed or accelerated under the 2008 plan document if permitted or required under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code; if payments are delayed after the later of the applicable triggering event or age 55, interest is credited at a rate based on the average monthly Moody's Corporate Bond Yield for Baa Public Utility Bonds over a sixty-month period preceding September 1 of the prior year. EIX established this interest rate for all plan participants, and may change the interest rate on a prospective basis.
The annuity options available under the 2008 plan document have the same features as the annuity options available under the grandfathered plan document. Account balances payable in installments under the 2008 plan document earn interest at a rate of interest determined in the same manner as described in the preceding paragraph for delayed payments.
The final average pay benefit formula includes benefit reductions for termination prior to age 55, or early retirement after attaining age 55 but prior to age 61, similar to the formula for the SCE Retirement Plan discussed above. If an NEO terminates prior to age 55 but with a total of 68 years of age and service, the final average pay benefit formula includes a special early retirement benefit reduction based on the SCE Retirement Plan formula for early retirement. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Pizarro and Petmecky were eligible for this special early retirement benefit. An unreduced early retirement benefit is available for retirement at age 61 through age 64, but none of the NEOs qualified as of December 31, 2018.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
The following tables present information regarding the contributions to and earnings on the EIX and SCE NEOs' deferred compensation balances during 2018, and the total deferred amounts for the NEOs at the end of 2018. All deferrals are under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP), except for restricted stock units (RSUs) that vested or are considered to have been vested for certain purposes at the end of 2018 as a result of the retirement vesting provisions applicable to the RSUs.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
As part of the 2008 Internal Revenue Code Section 409A amendments, the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan was separated into two plan documents. The grandfathered plan document applies to deferrals earned, determined and vested prior to January 1, 2005, while the 2008 plan document applies to deferrals earned, determined or vested on or after January 1, 2005.
Contributions
Each NEO may elect to defer up to 75% of base salary. Each NEO may also elect to defer up to either 85% or 100% (less the tax withholding due in connection with the deferral) of: any annual incentive award earned; certain special retention, recognition, or other special cash awards; the cash portion of performance share payouts; and certain other qualifying equity awards (other than stock options).
For 2017, the Company made a matching contribution of up to 3% of each NEO's annual incentive award, 6% of the portion of each NEO's base salary that was deferred and up to 6% of the portion, if any, of non-deferred salary that exceeded 401(k) Plan Internal Revenue Code limits. NEOs vest in their matching contributions and earnings thereon after five years of service, upon death or disability, or a separation from service where the NEO becomes entitled to severance benefits under the Severance Plan. The Committee changed the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan effective January 1, 2018 to eliminate matching contributions, in order to simplify the plan and decrease the portion of executives' compensation and benefits packages not tied directly to performance. The last matching contributions were for 2017 annual incentive awards paid in 2018.
Interest
Amounts deferred (including earnings and matching contributions) accrue interest until paid. The interest crediting rate on each NEO's account balance is the average monthly Moody's Corporate Bond Yield for Baa Public Utility Bonds over a sixty-month period ending September 1. EIX established this interest rate for all plan participants, and has discretion to change the interest rate on a prospective basis.
Payment of Grandfathered Benefits
Benefits under the grandfathered plan document may be deferred until a specified date, retirement, death or termination of employment. At the participant's election, compensation deferred until retirement or death may be paid as a lump sum, in monthly installments over 60, 120, or 180 months, or in a combination of a partial lump sum and installments. Deferred compensation is paid as a single lump sum or in three annual installments upon any other termination of employment. However, if a participant's employment is terminated without cause, the participant may elect to receive payment at such time or a later date when the participant turns age 55, and the same payment options available for retirement will generally be applicable.
Each NEO was permitted to elect at the time of deferral to receive payment of such deferral on a fixed date in accordance with procedures established under the grandfathered plan document, and deferred amounts may also be paid in connection with a change in control of EIX or SCE in certain circumstances.
Certain amounts deferred under the grandfathered plan document may be withdrawn at any time at the election of an NEO; however, any amounts withdrawn are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Emergency hardship withdrawals without penalty also may be permitted at EIX's discretion.
Payment of 2008 Plan Benefits
Benefits under the 2008 plan document may be deferred until a specified date no later than the date the participant turns age 75, retirement, death, disability or other separation from service. Participants have sub-accounts for each annual deferral for which the following forms of payment may be elected: single lump-sum; two to fifteen annual installments; or monthly installments for 60, 120 or 180 months.
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Payments triggered by retirement, death, disability or other separation from service may begin upon the applicable triggering event or a specified number of months and/or years following the applicable triggering event; however, payments may not begin later than the participant's 75th birthday unless the participant is still employed. Payments are subject to certain administrative earliest payment date rules, and may be delayed or accelerated under the 2008 plan document if permitted or required under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following plans provide benefits that may become payable to NEOs, depending on the circumstances surrounding their termination of employment with the Company. When listing the potential payments to the NEOs under the plans described below, it is assumed that the applicable triggering event (retirement or other termination of employment) occurred on December 31, 2018 and that the price per share of EIX Common Stock is equal to the closing price as of the last NYSE trading day in 2018.
2008 Executive Severance Plan
EIX provides severance benefits and change-in-control benefits to executives, including all of the NEOs, under the 2008 Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan"). In addition, severance benefits are provided through other plans or agreements included in the following description of severance benefits.
To receive any severance benefits, an NEO must release EIX and its affiliates from all claims arising out of the officer's employment relationship and agree to certain confidentiality and non-solicitation restrictions in favor of the Company.
Severance Benefits – No Change in Control
Under the Severance Plan, an eligible executive is generally entitled to severance benefits if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated without "cause" and other than due to the executive's "disability" (as these terms are defined in the Severance Plan).
Severance Plan benefits payable upon an involuntary termination without cause include:
In addition to Severance Plan benefits, other benefits payable to an eligible executive upon an involuntary termination without cause generally include: 
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Severance Benefits – Change in Control
The severance benefits described above would be enhanced if the NEO's employment is terminated for a qualifying reason during a period that started six months before and ended two years after a change in control of EIX. Qualifying reasons are defined to include an involuntary termination of the NEO's employment for any reason other than cause or disability, or the NEO's voluntary termination of employment for a "good reason" (as this term is defined in the Severance Plan). Except as noted below, these benefits are not triggered automatically by a change in control absent an actual or constructive termination of the NEO's employment by the Company without cause.
Upon a qualifying termination, outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and performance shares and related dividend equivalents would become fully vested, with performance shares and related dividend equivalents only becoming earned if actual performance during the performance period results in a payout, and with stock options remaining exercisable for up to three years. Absent a qualifying termination, stock options and performance shares would continue to vest on their normal schedule unless the awards were not continued or assumed.
The EIX 2007 Performance Incentive Plan and terms and conditions of awards under the plan provide for special rules that would apply if outstanding equity awards were not continued or assumed in connection with any dissolution, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or stock, merger or reorganization, or other event where EIX is not the surviving corporation. Following such a transaction, and regardless of whether an NEO's employment were terminated, outstanding stock options and performance shares and any related dividend equivalents would become fully vested. Options that became vested with a change in control would be exercised prior to the change in control or "cashed-out" in connection with the change-in-control transaction.
Performance shares and related dividend equivalents would be earned based on a shortened performance period. The performance period applicable to the performance shares would be deemed to end on the day before the change in control, and performance shares would vest and become payable, if at all, based on EIX's TSR ranking or achievement of EPS target, as applicable, during the shortened performance period. Any performance shares that became payable during the shortened performance period associated with a change in control would be paid in cash within 74 days after the change in control, and any performance shares that did not become payable would terminate for no value on the date of the change in control.
In such a change in control transaction described above, the restricted stock units would generally continue to vest and become payable according to their original vesting schedule, unless the restricted stock units are terminated in accordance with special rules under Code Section 409A, in which case they would become fully vested.
For Messrs. Pizarro, Payne, and Umanoff and Ms. Rigatti, the enhanced change-in-control severance benefits would be: 
For the other NEOs, the enhanced change-in-control severance benefits would be:

Deferred Compensation Plans
Upon an NEO's retirement or other termination of employment, the NEO generally will receive a payout of any non-qualified deferred compensation balances under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. The Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table and related discussion above describe these deferred compensation balances and payment terms. In the event of involuntary termination not for cause or qualifying termination in a change in control, unvested amounts derived from Company contributions would vest. Only Messrs. Umanoff and Murphy had such unvested amounts as of December 31, 2018, which would have totaled $97,919 and $47,073, respectively.

Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Company is required to disclose in this Proxy Statement (i) the ratio of the total annual compensation of the EIX CEO to the median of the total annual compensation of all employees of EIX and its consolidated subsidiaries other than the EIX CEO (collectively, "EIX Employees"), and (ii) the ratio of the total annual compensation of the SCE CEO to the median of the total annual compensation of all employees of SCE and its consolidated subsidiaries other than the SCE CEO (collectively, "SCE Employees").
Based on SEC rules for this disclosure and applying the median employee identification process described below, EIX has determined that the EIX CEO's total compensation for 2018 was $9,824,871, and the median of the total 2018 compensation of EIX Employees was $166,888, and SCE has determined that the SCE CEO's total compensation for 2018 was $3,124,248, and the median of the total 2018 compensation of SCE Employees was $148,404. Accordingly, EIX estimates the ratio of the EIX CEO's total compensation for 2018 to the median of the total 2018 compensation of EIX Employees to be 59 to 1, and SCE estimates the ratio of the SCE CEO's total compensation for 2018 to the median of the total 2018 compensation of SCE Employees to be 21 to 1.
EIX and SCE identified the median EIX Employee and the median SCE Employee, respectively, for the pay-ratio disclosure in the Company 2018 Proxy Statement. EIX and SCE believe that neither Company experienced changes from 2017 to 2018 with respect to their employee populations or employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact their respective pay-ratio disclosures for 2018. Accordingly, as permitted by SEC rules, the median EIX Employee and the median SCE Employee identified for the pay-ratio disclosure in the Company 2018 Proxy Statement were used as the median EIX employee and median SCE Employee, respectively, for this pay-ratio disclosure in this Proxy Statement.
The total annual compensation for 2018 for each of those two median employees and for the CEOs was determined using the same rules that apply to reporting NEO compensation in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Tables above, except that compensation under non-discriminatory benefit plans was also included in the calculation of the total annual compensation for 2018 for the median employees and the CEOs for purposes of this pay-ratio disclosure. Messrs. Pizarro and Payne received $47,348 and $36,140, respectively, in 2018 compensation under non-discriminatory benefit plans.

ITEM 4: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING PROXY ACCESS
John Chevedden, whose address is 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has notified EIX that he beneficially owns at least 100 shares of EIX and intends to present Item 4 for action at the Annual Meeting. The text of the shareholder proposal is included below as submitted by the proponent, and has not been endorsed or verified by EIX. The EIX Board response to the shareholder proposal follows.
Proposal 4 — Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access
RESOLVED: Stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated documents, to include the following change for the purpose of decreasing the average amount of Company common stock the average member of a nominating group would be required to hold for 3-years to satisfy the aggregate ownership requirements to form a nominating group:
No limitation shall be placed on the number of stockholders that can aggregate their shares to achieve the 3% of common stock required to nominate directors under our Company's proxy access provisions.
Even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the current 3% criteria for a continuous 3-years at most companies according to the Council of Institutional Investors. This proposal addresses the situation that our company now has with proxy access potentially for only the largest shareholders who are the least unlikely shareholders to make use of it.
It is especially important to improve a shareholder right, such as proxy access, when there seems to be a board refreshment problem at Edison International that needs to be addressed after the annual meeting.
There is a relatively recent management move to stack the Edison board with CEOs. Having a number of CEOs on a board can result in excessive empathy for a fellow CEO at Edison International and can be an impediment to proper oversight of the Edison CEO at the expense of shareholders and their investment in Edison. For example:
Furthermore Mr. O'Toole was elevated to the executive pay committee and Mr. Camuñez was elevated to the audit and nomination committees.

ITEM 4: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING PROXY ACCESS
Now is a good time to adopt this proposal given these critical issues that deserve strict oversight and the avoidance of reoccurrences:
Consumer Fraud/Abuse - Lawsuit against company and the California Public Utilities Commission over $3.7 Billion collected from consumers for failed repair and revival of San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant. July 2018
Lawsuits over alleged complicity to Thomas Wildfire causing massive property damage, Southern California Edison. February 2018
Lawsuit alleging breach of fiduciary duties over selection of investment options for 401(k.) Savings Plan. October 2017
Lawsuit against placement of planned nuclear waste site near earthquake zone, San Diego. April 2017
Also Linda Stuntz was an inside-related director who again received 10-times as many negative votes as certain other Edison directors.
Please vote to improve proxy access to give shareholders more standing to address the Edison need for board refreshment:
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access- Proposal 4
EIX Board Recommendation "Against" Item 4
The EIX Board of Directors has considered the shareholder proposal requesting the EIX Board amend its proxy access bylaw as described above (Item 4 on your Proxy Card) and recommends you vote "Against" the proposal for the following reasons.
The Company has already adopted Bylaws that give shareholders a meaningful and appropriate proxy access right.
The shareholder proposal is unnecessary because our shareholders already have a meaningful and appropriate proxy access right. In 2015, after engaging with a number of our shareholders, the EIX Board adopted proxy access for director elections at annual meetings. The EIX Bylaws provide the Company will include in its Proxy Statement up to two nominees (or nominees for up to 20% of the Board, whichever is greater) submitted by a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders owning at least 3% of EIX common stock continuously for at least three years, if the shareholder group and nominee satisfy the requirements in the EIX Bylaws. These parameters have become standard among companies that have adopted proxy access.
The EIX Board believes the current group aggregation limit of 20 shareholders reflects best practices and is in the best interests of our shareholders.
The shareholder proposal requests that the Board amend the EIX Bylaws to remove the limit of 20 shareholders who may aggregate shares to reach the 3% ownership requirement. The proponent submitted a similar proposal in each of the last two years. The prior proposals did not pass in both 2017 and 2018.
Before adopting proxy access, we obtained feedback from major shareholders holding approximately 30% of EIX Common Stock, including each of our top five holders. These shareholders supported the 20-shareholder limit, which has become a standard proxy access term. More than 90% of companies that have adopted proxy access since 2015 have a group aggregation limit of exactly 20 shareholders.
We believe the 20-shareholder limit provides a reasonable and effective proxy access right to shareholders while minimizing the administrative burden and expense to EIX in reviewing and verifying the required information provided by each member of the nominating shareholder group.
Given the widespread support of the 20-shareholder limit among companies and shareholders, we believe the current group limit reflects best practices and continues to be in the best interests of our shareholders.

ITEM 4: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING PROXY ACCESS
Our Board has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to Board refreshment and diversity.
The proponent's supporting statement refers to a board refreshment problem at EIX. However, our Board has shown a strong commitment to Board refreshment and diversity. Our average Board tenure is 4.6 years compared to an average of 8.1 years for S&P 500 companies. Nine of our 12 director nominees have served on the Board for less than six years, including five new independent directors elected to the Board in the last three years. Four of our director nominees (33%) are women and four of our director nominees (33%) reflect ethnic diversity, which exceeds the average gender and ethnic diversity at S&P 500 companies.
The proponent notes that four of our director nominees are CEOs. However, each nominee brings a different leadership experience, approach and perspective that contributes to the diversity and effectiveness of the Board. As discussed above, these nominees bring skills and experience from a variety of industries that are particularly relevant to our business and strategy.
The Company has a strong corporate governance structure and record of accountability.
The Company's current corporate governance structure reflects a significant and ongoing commitment to strong and effective governance practices and a willingness to be responsive and accountable to shareholders. We regularly assess and refine our corporate governance policies and procedures to take into account evolving best practices and to address shareholder feedback.
In addition to adopting a meaningful and appropriate proxy access right, we have implemented numerous other corporate governance measures to ensure the Board remains accountable to shareholders, to provide our shareholders with a meaningful voice in the nomination and election of directors, and to provide our shareholders with the ability to communicate with directors and promote the consideration of shareholder views. These measures are discussed above in the Proxy Summary and under "Our Corporate Governance."
For the foregoing reasons, the EIX Board recommends you vote "AGAINST" Item 4.

MEETING AND VOTING INFORMATION
What is included in the proxy materials?
The proxy materials include the Proxy Statement (which includes a letter to shareholders and a Notice of Annual Meeting), the Annual Report, the Proxy Card, and the Notice of Internet Availability.
Why did the Company mail a Notice of Internet Availability instead of a printed copy of the materials?
Providing the proxy materials to shareholders via the Internet saves us the cost of printing and mailing documents and reduces the impact of the Annual Meeting on the environment.
If you received only a Notice of Internet Availability, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request them. The Notice includes instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials, submit your proxy via the Internet, and request a printed copy of proxy materials by mail.
Why did some shareholders receive printed or email copies of the proxy materials?
We are distributing printed copies of the proxy materials to shareholders who have previously requested printed copies. We are providing shareholders who have previously requested electronic delivery of proxy materials with an email containing a link to the website where the materials are available via the Internet.

MEETING AND VOTING INFORMATION

If you are a Registered Shareholder, your shares will not be voted.
If you hold your shares in Street Name, most brokers or other nominees will only have authority to vote your shares on ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm (Item 2). Regarding each of the other Items, most brokers or other nominees will not have authority to vote your shares, and the shares will instead be treated as "broker non-votes." See below for the vote required to approve each item.
If you are a 401(k) Plan Shareholder, the 401(k) Plan trustee will vote your shares in the same proportion to the 401(k) Plan shares voted by other 401(k) Plan Shareholders, unless contrary to ERISA.
How many votes do you need to hold the meeting?
A quorum is required for the Company to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes that all shareholders may cast constitutes a quorum. All shares represented by a properly signed proxy will be considered as present and part of the quorum, even if you or your broker or other nominee doesn't vote or abstains on any or all matters.
As of the record date, EIX had 325,811,206 shares of Common Stock outstanding, 325,801,788 of which may cast one vote each. Therefore, a quorum for EIX is 162,900,895 shares. SCE had 4,800,198 shares of Cumulative Preferred Stock outstanding and entitled to cast 28,801,188 votes, and 434,888,104 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to cast 434,888,104 votes. Voting together as a class, the SCE shareholders may cast 463,689,292 votes. Therefore, a quorum for SCE is 231,844,647 shares.
What vote is required to approve each Item at the meeting?
Shareholders may vote "for," "against" or "abstain" with respect to each proposal. A director nominee will be elected and a proposal will be approved if the following votes are obtained: 
Who will count the votes?
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes. To protect the confidentiality of votes cast under the 401(k) Plan, 401(k) Plan Shareholders' voting instructions are given directly to Broadridge. Broadridge will tabulate those votes and provide aggregate voting results directly to the 401(k) Plan trustee. EIX will not have access to any of the 401(k) Plan Shareholders' voting instructions, and 401(k) Plan voting results are only reported to EIX in the aggregate.
How much will this proxy solicitation cost?
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist us with the solicitation of proxies and will pay an aggregate fee of $22,500 (EIX $20,000 and SCE $2,500) plus expenses.
