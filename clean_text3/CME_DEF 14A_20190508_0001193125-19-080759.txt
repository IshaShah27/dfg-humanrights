One North Wacker Drive 
Chicago, Illinois 60606 
March 20, 2019 
Dear Shareholder: 
You are invited to attend the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders of CME Group Inc. 
Shareholders will vote on the following items: 
Item 1: To elect seventeen directors that we refer to as "Equity directors." 
Item 2: To ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Item 3: To approve, by advisory vote, the compensation of our named executive officers. 
Item 4: To elect three Class B-1 directors, two Class B-2 directors and one Class B-3 director. 
Item 5: To elect five members to each of the Class B-1,Class B-2 and Class B-3 nominating committees. 
Your vote is important. You are eligible to vote if you were a shareholder of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to read this proxy statement and vote your shares as soon as possible. Please review the instructions on each of your voting options described in the General Information section of this proxy statement on page 3. 
Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) "notice and access" rules, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. On or around March 22, 2019, we mailed to our shareholders (other than those who previously requested email or paper delivery) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice). If you received a Notice, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review all the important information contained in the proxy statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (Annual Report). We believe that providing our proxy materials over the Internet increases the ability of our shareholders to receive the information they need, while reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting. You may, however, follow the instructions in the Notice to request hard copy materials. 
By order of the board of directors, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

HOW DO I VOTE? 
Shareholders of record (shareholders having an account at Computershare, our transfer agent) have the following ways to cast their vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via Internet—You can vote over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice. You may  vote until 10:59 p.m., Central Time, on Tuesday, May 7, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail—If you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can vote by mail pursuant to  instructions provided on the proxy card. Be sure to allow sufficient time for delivery.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By calling  1-800-690-6903 (owners of Class A shares only)—You will need to reference  your control number when voting. You may vote until 10:59 p.m., Central Time, on Tuesday, May 7, 2019. Because the separate Class B proposals are contested, automated telephone voting will not be available for Class B shareholders.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person—By voting at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
For holders in street name (shareholders holding through a bank or broker), your proxy materials include a voting instruction form from the institution holding your shares. The availability of internet or telephone voting will depend upon the institution's voting processes. You may also vote in person at the annual meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from the institution holding your shares. Please contact the institution holding your shares for more information. 
Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote your shares promptly. Voting early will not affect your right to change your vote and/or to attend the meeting. 
WHAT IS A SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD? 
A shareholder of record or registered shareholder is a shareholder whose ownership of CME Group stock is reflected directly on the books and records of our transfer agent, Computershare. If you hold stock through a bank, broker or other intermediary, you hold your shares in street name and are not a shareholder of record. For shares held in street name, the record owner of your shares is your bank, broker or other intermediary. We only have access to ownership records for the registered shares. Therefore, if you are not a registered shareholder, you will need to bring additional documentation to evidence your stock ownership as of the record date, such as a copy of your brokerage account statement showing ownership as of the record date, a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee or a copy of your voting instruction card in order to be admitted to the annual meeting. 
HOW ARE PROXY MATERIALS BEING DISTRIBUTED? 
This year we are taking advantage of SEC rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to our shareholders via the Internet through the mailing of the Notice instead of mailing printed copies. Most of our shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. 
The Notice was mailed on or around March 22, 2019, The Notice provides instructions on how you may vote your shares over the Internet. If you would like to receive paper copies or electronic copies of our proxy materials, you may follow the instructions in the Notice. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE NOTICE, OR SET OF PROXY MATERIALS? 
This means that you have multiple accounts holding CME Group shares. Shares with different registrations cannot be combined and as a result, you may receive more than one Notice or set of proxy materials. For example, shares held through your broker cannot be combined with shares held at our transfer agent, Computershare. Additionally, our Class B shares are not combined with our Class A shares. 
If you receive more than one Notice, you must vote each to ensure that all classes of shares you own are voted. 
WHY DID MEMBERS OF MY HOUSEHOLD ONLY RECEIVE ONE SET OF PROXY MATERIALS BUT MORE THAN ONE PROXY? 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or Notice addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "house-holding," potentially means extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. As the company has adopted this procedure, a single set of proxy materials or Notice will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholder. 
If you participate in house-holding and wish to receive separate copies of the Notice or, if applicable, the proxy materials, please go to www.computershare.com/investor. After the login, go to "My Profile" and select "Communication Preference" to choose your preferred method of delivery. 
Beneficial shareholders can request information about house-holding from their banks, brokers or other holders of record. 
WHAT IF I RETURN MY PROXY BUT DO NOT PROVIDE VOTING INSTRUCTIONS? 
If you sign and date the proxy without indicating your instructions on how to vote your shares, the proxies will vote your shares as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the seventeen Equity director nominees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for  2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, on an advisory basis, as described  in this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "ABSTAIN" from voting for the Class B directors, if applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "ABSTAIN" from voting for the Class B nominating committees, if applicable.  
[END TABLE]
If any other matter is presented at the annual meeting, your proxies will vote in accordance with their best judgment. At the time this proxy statement went to press, we knew of no matters to be addressed at the annual meeting beyond those described in this proxy statement. 
CAN I CHANGE MY MIND AFTER I VOTE? 
For shareholders of record: You may change or revoke your vote by submitting a written notice of revocation directed to the Corporate Secretary, CME Group Inc., 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 or by submitting a subsequent vote electronically, by telephone or at the annual meeting. 
For holders in street name: You may change or revoke your voting instructions by following the specific directions provided to you by your bank, broker or intermediary. 
Your most recent vote is the one that is counted. 
IS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL? 
The vote of a particular shareholder will be kept confidential, except as necessary to allow the inspectors of election to certify the voting results or to meet legal requirements. Written comments may be provided by Broadridge to our Corporate Secretary, Kathleen M. Cronin, with the name and address of the shareholder. Each comment will be provided without reference to the vote of the shareholder, unless the vote is mentioned in the comment or unless disclosure of the vote is necessary to understand the comment. 
HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED? 
For us to conduct the meeting, a minimum number of votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all outstanding common stock as of March 11, 2019, must be present in person or represented by proxy. This is referred to as a quorum. 
For proposals brought before the holders of all classes of common stock, voting together without regard to class, at least one-third of the votes entitled to be cast by such holders must be present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy to establish a quorum. 
For proposals brought before the holders of Class B-1, Class B-2 and Class B-3 common stock, each voting separately as a class, at least one-third of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of each such class must be present at the meeting to establish a quorum. See page 28 for additional information on the quorum requirement for Items 4 and 5. 
Proxies marked "withhold" or "abstain" are counted as present for establishing a quorum. Additionally, because we have one routine item on the agenda—the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm — "broker non-votes" received on the other proposals also will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum for proposals brought before the holders of all classes of common stock, voting together without regard to class. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker does not vote on a proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power for that particular proposal applicable stock exchange requirements and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 
To ensure that there will be a quorum for all proposals to be voted on, please vote before the annual meeting and allow your shares to be represented at the meeting by your proxies. Voting before the annual meeting will not prevent you from voting in person at the meeting. If you vote in person at the meeting, your previous vote will be revoked automatically. 
HOW MANY VOTES ARE REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL FOR EACH PROPOSAL? 
Assuming that a quorum is present for the particular proposal, the following describes the votes required to approve each proposal. 
Item 1: Seventeen Equity directors have been nominated for election at the annual meeting. Our bylaws require that, in uncontested elections, each Equity director be elected by the majority of votes cast with respect to such director. This means that the number of shares voted "for" an Equity director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee in order for that nominee to be elected. Only votes "for" or "against" are counted as votes cast with respect to an Equity director. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect. If a nominee who currently is serving as a director does not receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast, Delaware law provides that the director would continue to serve on the board as a "holdover director." However, under our corporate governance principles, each holdover director is required to tender his or her resignation to the board. Under the principles, the governance committee shall make a recommendation to the board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The governance committee and the board, in making their decisions, may consider any factor or other information that they deem relevant. The board shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the governance committee's recommendation, and shall publicly disclose its decision regarding the resignation within ninety (90) days after the results of the election are certified. If the resignation is not accepted, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until the director's successor is elected. 
Items 2 and 3: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is necessary for approval. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "against" an item. Because Item 2 is considered a "routine" matter, broker non-votes are not expected to occur with respect to that item. Broker non-votes will have no effect on Item 3. 
Item 4: The three nominees for Class B-1 director, the two nominees for Class B-2 director and the one nominee for Class B-3 director receiving the highest number of "for" votes will be elected. Abstentions will have no effect on these items because they are not considered votes cast. All Class B shares are held in registered form. 
Item 5: The five nominees for the Class B-1 nominating committee, the five nominees for the Class B-2 nominating committee and the five nominees for the Class B-3 nominating committee receiving the highest number of "for" votes will be elected. Abstentions will have no effect on these items because they are not considered votes cast. All Class B shares are held in registered form. 
WHO PAYS FOR THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES? 
The solicitation is being conducted by CME Group, which pays for the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies will be solicited on behalf of the board of directors. This solicitation is being made by mail and over the Internet, but also may be made by telephone or in person. We have hired D.F. King for $14,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses, to assist in the solicitation. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their out-of-pocket expenses for sending proxy materials to shareholders and obtaining their vote.

You are being asked to vote on the election of seventeen Equity director nominees to hold office until the 2020 annual meeting. 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE EQUITY DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
Our directors are elected each year. Each director's term will last until the 2020 annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected. 
We have implemented a majority vote standard for the Equity directors, except in the event of a contested election. 
The Equity directors are nominated by the board based on the recommendation of the nominating committee for election by our Class A and Class B shareholders voting together (Equity directors) under Item 1. All Equity director nominees, except for Mr. Kaye and Ms. Lockett, are presently CME Group directors. 
In November 2018, the company held a special meeting seeking approval of a proposal to eliminate all or some of the director election rights of our Class B shareholders. While the proposal received majority support from each of the required class votes, it did not achieve approval from a majority of the outstanding shares in the separate votes of the Class B shareholders as required under Delaware law. Therefore, the Class B shareholders will continue to have the right to elect six additional directors (Class B directors) as described under Item 4. 
We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. 
The biographies for the Equity director nominees begin on page 12 and for the Class B director nominees on page 28.Mr. Bernacchi who currently serves as a Class B-1 director will retire at the end of his term. 
References to terms of our board of directors in their biographies include service on the board of CME Group (formerly known as Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.) from its formation in 2001 and service on the board of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME). CME Group became a public company in December 2002. The boards of our other exchange subsidiaries, Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc. (CBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (NYMEX) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), also are composed of the same members as the CME Group board of directors. Ages are as of March 11, 2019. Information on public directorships is for the past five years. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS 
The policy of the board of directors is to remain an interactive, independent, thoughtful, highly qualified and collegial combination of individuals with diverse knowledge, skills and experience, so that the directors, working together, possess the competencies required to effectively carry out the board's responsibilities. 
In considering candidates for the board, the nominating committee, composed entirely of directors who are independent under applicable listing standards, considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials. With respect to the nomination of continuing directors for re-election, the individual's contributions to the board are also considered. In assessing new candidates for the board, we do not have specific minimum qualifications that an individual must meet to be considered. The board and its nominating committee seek members having the characteristics essential for effectiveness as a member of our board, including but not limited to:

On an annual basis, the governance committee and the nominating committee meet jointly to assess the current and future needs of the board and will make recommendations to the board in the event they identify a need to recruit for an additional member of the board. The board believes it is essential that its members represent diverse viewpoints. In addition to the foregoing criteria, the nominating committee is committed to ensuring each pool of qualified candidates from which board nominees are chosen includes candidates who bring racial and/or gender diversity. 
The nominating committee may solicit candidates from its current directors and, if deemed appropriate, retain for a fee recruiting professionals to identify and evaluate candidates. The nominating committee also will consider a nominee for Equity director recommended by shareholders if the recommendation is submitted in writing, accompanied by a description of the proposed nominee's qualifications, and other relevant biographical information and evidence of consent of the proposed nominee to serve as a director if elected. Recommendations should be addressed to the nominating committee, Attention: Corporate Secretary, CME Group Inc., 20 South Wacker Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606. In considering a shareholder recommendation, the nominating committee may seek input from an independent advisor, legal counsel and/or other directors, as appropriate, and will reach a conclusion using its standard criteria. A copy of our nominating committee's charter is available on our website. 
Both Mr. Kaye and Ms. Lockett were identified by certain members of our nominating committee and also were known by other members of our board based on their professional experience. Mr. Kaye brings his extensive experience in accounting to the board and has been classified as an audit committee financial expert. Ms. Lockett brings her leadership and experience in innovating education and personalized learning technologies and through her election further enhances the diversity of the board of directors.

See Item 5 beginning on page 32 for more information. Our certificate of incorporation requires that director candidates for election by a class of Class B common stock own, or be recognized under our rules as the owner of, at least one share of that class. 
For more information concerning our current directors' qualifications, see the Director Attributes table on page 16.

[END TABLE]
We strongly encourage, but do not require, our directors to attend the annual meeting. Last year, 16 of our directors attended the annual meeting of shareholders. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
The experience and diversity of our directors has been, and continues to be, critical to our success. Our corporate governance principles require that the board be composed of at least a majority of independent directors. Additionally, in accordance with applicable listing standards, the members of our audit, compensation, governance and nominating committees must be independent. For a director to be considered independent, the board must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with CME Group. The board has adopted categorical independence standards, which are attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A, to assist it in making its determinations regarding independence. These standards conform to and exceed the independence criteria specified in the listing standards of Nasdaq. They specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including relationships and transactions between each director, director nominee, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her affiliates, charitable organizations with which he or she is affiliated, and us. 
The board believes all of its non-executive directors act independently of, and effectively monitor and oversee the actions of, management. Based on our categorical independence standards, at its meeting held in February 2019, the governance committee made a preliminary assessment of the independence of the directors and director nominees and based on such assessment made a recommendation to our board regarding their independence. Some of our directors are members of our exchanges, which provides them with access to our open outcry markets, lower trading fees, the ability to vote on certain matters relating to the operation of our open outcry markets and, for members of CME, the ability to elect six of our directors. Directors who are members of our exchanges may make payments directly to us or indirectly to us through our clearing firms in connection with their trading activity on an exchange. To ensure that such payments did not exceed the monetary thresholds set forth in the listing standards of Nasdaq, the governance committee reviewed the directors' and their affiliated clearing firms' trading activities and relationships with our exchanges as part of its independence determination. The governance committee and the board noted that all payments relating to trading fees were made in the ordinary course of our business, were on terms consistent with those prevailing at the time for corresponding transactions by similarly situated unrelated third parties and were not in excess of the applicable payment thresholds. 
After considering information provided by our current directors and other nominees in our annual questionnaires, the payments made to us relating to trading activities, as well as additional information gathered by our office of the secretary, the governance committee recommended, and the board determined, that all current directors and nominees for Equity and Class B director be classified as independent except for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Duffy and Spencer based on their employment relationships with CME Group; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Lockett based on donations received by LEAP Innovations, of which Ms. Lockett is the Chief Executive Officer,  from CME Group in 2016, which exceeded 5% of its charitable receipts for the year. We expect that Ms. Lockett will be deemed independent three years after the time of those donations.  
[END TABLE]
PUBLIC DIRECTORS 
As the parent company of four self-regulatory organizations, we are required to ensure we meet the core principles of the CFTC which, among other things, require that we have processes and procedures to address potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the operation of our exchanges. Significant representation of individuals who do not have relationships with our exchanges, referred to as "public directors" in the CFTC regulations, play an important role in our processes to address potential conflicts of interest. The board has assessed which directors would be considered public directors based upon their lack of relationship with our exchanges and the industry per the CFTC regulations. The following individuals meet the definition of "public director":

Additionally, our market regulation oversight committee is composed solely of public directors. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Mr. Duffy has served as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2016. Our board leadership structure includes an independent Lead Director and our active board members, of which more than a majority are considered independent. Mr. Gerdes has served as our independent Lead Director since 2017. The independent Lead Director is appointed by the board based on the recommendation of the governance committee for a one-year term and has the following responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presides at meetings of the board if the Chairman is unavailable and at executive sessions of the board's independent  directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presides at the board's annual evaluation of the Chairman's achievement of his goals and objectives.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Communicates to the Chairman the results of meetings at which he presides.  
[END TABLE]

• Receives direct communications from directors and/or shareholders in cases where the Chairman is unavailable or where direct  communication with the Chairman may not be appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Confers with the Chairman, in the Chairman's discretion, in regards to board agendas, scheduling and information  distribution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Has the authority to call a special meeting of the board in accordance with our bylaws.  
[END TABLE]
Our governance documents provide the board with the flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for CME Group. In making leadership determinations, the board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of our shareholders. A combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer position provides us with a single leader who communicates the company's business and strategy to our shareholders, customers, employees, regulators and the public. The board believes its current leadership structure allows it to effectively operate, represent the rights of our shareholders and create long-term value and provides a well-functioning and effective balance between strong management leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by an independent Lead Director and non-employee board members. The board reserves the right to make changes to its governance structure in the future as it deems appropriate. 
BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT 
While senior management has primary responsibility for managing the company's risk on a day-to-day basis, the board has responsibility for overseeing our risk management activities and the overall programs designed to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks and opportunities as evaluated through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. The board oversees the business of the company, including the risk management programs and results, with the goal of serving the long-term interests of our shareholders. The board has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of our risks, with its focus on the particular risks facing the company. 
Our business exposes us to risks that we organize under six key themes: clearing, compliance, financial, operational, reputational, and strategic & commercial. Our ERM program promotes and facilitates the evolution and alignment of consistent and transparent risk management practices at CME Group. Through the ERM program, we provide a comprehensive review of our risk management practices and endeavor, in an ongoing manner, to provide assurances that the enterprise risks are identified, assessed, measured, prioritized and updated by management responsible for the respective risks. 
The risk committee is primarily responsible for reviewing, assessing and providing oversight of our risk management practices with respect to those risks enumerated in its charter and assisting the board in its oversight of the effectiveness of our policies and processes to identify, manage and plan for risks. The risk committee approves the ERM framework, the risk universe and reviews and recommends to the board the various levels of acceptable appetite for managing key risks associated with the company's business and strategy. In addition to quarterly risk reports, the risk committee also receives quarterly reports on the control functions relating to information security, compliance and business continuity. 
The board also assigns oversight of risks to other committees, such as the clearing house oversight and compensation committees. This structure is designed to increase the effectiveness of our board's oversight by taking into account the

[END TABLE]
 background and experience of the members on various board committees, including their interactions with management. Each committee reports on its activities to the full board. The appendix to the charter of the risk committee provides additional detail on the allocation of risk oversight responsibilities to the various committees. The charter for the risk committee is available on our website. 
Our universe of risks is reported to the board and senior management on a quarterly basis along with updates of any developments that could affect our risk profile or other aspects of our business. Risk management and mitigation is ongoing, and the importance assigned to identified risks can change and new risks can emerge during the year as the company develops and implements its strategy. 
Our ultimate objective is to help preserve and protect our enterprise value and to help increase the likelihood of achieving our objectives while maintaining or enhancing our reputation. In doing so, the board understands it may not be practicable or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to accept certain risks to achieve our goals and objectives and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
Our corporate governance principles require our independent directors to meet in executive session (without management and non-independent directors) on a quarterly basis. These sessions are chaired by the independent Lead Director. The chair of the executive session may, at his discretion, invite our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, other non-independent directors or other members of management to participate in a portion of such executive session, as appropriate. 
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF BOARD, COMMITTEE AND INDIVIDUAL DIRECTOR PERFORMANCE 
As provided in our corporate governance principles, the board annually reviews its own performance, structure and processes in order to assess how effectively it is functioning. The assessment is implemented and administered by the governance committee through an annual board self-evaluation survey. Our process also includes individual peer director evaluations. All of our board established committees, except for the executive committee, conduct an annual self-assessment. 
REPORTING CONCERNS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Our audit committee has adopted procedures for the receipt of complaints relating to accounting, internal control over financial reporting and auditing matters. Such concerns may be made anonymously through our independent helpline provider and any allegations relating to financial matters are automatically referred to the chairman of the audit committee and will be handled in accordance with the adopted procedures. A copy of the procedures is available on our website. 
CONTACTING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Shareholders may contact the board of directors, including a committee of the board or the independent directors as a group, by using the following address: 
CME Group Inc. 
Attn: Board of Directors c/o Office of the Secretary 
20 South Wacker Drive 
Chicago, Illinois 60606 
Email: directors@cmegroup.com 
All communications received will be compiled by the office of the secretary and submitted to the governance committee on a quarterly basis or more frequently as appropriate. Emails received via directors@cmegroup.com are screened for junk commercial email and general solicitations. If a communication does not involve an ordinary business matter as described below and if a particular director is named, the communication will be forwarded to that director. 
In order to expedite a response to ordinary business matters, the governance committee has authorized management to receive, research and respond, if appropriate, on behalf of our directors, including a particular director or its non-executive directors, to any communication regarding a product of an exchange or transactions by a clearing firm or a member of an exchange, referred to as an "ordinary business matter." Any director may review any such communication or response thereto. 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Shareholders who invest in our company and elect the board of directors are entitled to open and meaningful information about our business, strategies, corporate governance and senior management compensation practices so they can make informed decisions and knowledgeably participate in the proxy voting process. The board thoughtfully considers the opinions expressed by shareholders through their votes, periodic meetings and other communications and believes that shareholder engagement leads to enhanced governance practices. These engagements may cover governance, compensation and other matters to ensure that management and the board understand and address the issues that are important to our shareholders. 
As owners of our company, you are encouraged to contact us through our provided communication channels to provide your feedback. If you have a corporate governance or compensation matter that you would like to discuss with the board or a particular committee, you may send an email to officeofthesecretary@cmegroup.com. 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
The responsibilities of each committee composed entirely of board members are summarized in this proxy statement and described in more detail in each committee's written charter. Copies of these charters are available on our website. In addition, the board has established clearing house risk committees, which are designed to include key market participants as members. 
In the following descriptions, the chairman is designated with a "C," the independent members are designated with an "I," public directors are identified with a "P," and audit committee financial experts with an "F." Members of the committee are as of the date of the proxy statement.

       ITEM 2—Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young  LLP as   our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019   
[END TABLE]
You are being asked to vote on the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Ernst & Young served as our accounting firm for 2018. 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
The audit committee has appointed Ernst & Young as CME Group's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. We are not required to have the shareholders ratify the selection of Ernst & Young as our independent auditor. We nonetheless are doing so because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, the audit committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Ernst & Young, but may choose to retain such independent auditor. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of CME Group and its shareholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young will be present at the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by shareholders. In connection with the audit of our 2018 financial statements, we entered into an engagement letter with Ernst & Young, which sets forth the terms by which Ernst & Young would perform audit services for us and which did not include any limitations of liability for punitive damages. We expect to enter into a similar engagement letter with Ernst & Young for 2019. 
Ernst & Young has served as the company's auditor since 2002. In accordance with its charter, the audit committee considers annually whether there should be a rotation of the independent auditor. The audit committee has determined that it is in the interest of the company and its shareholders to continue the engagement with Ernst & Young and recommends that shareholders ratify the appointment. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS PRE-APPROVAL PROCESSES FOR NON-AUDIT SERVICES 
The audit committee is responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approving all services (audit and non-audit) performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with such policies and procedures, the audit committee is required to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in order to ensure that the provision of such services is in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and does not impair the registered public accounting firm's independence. Under the policy, pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year, any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific budget. In addition, the audit committee may pre-approve additional services on a case-by-case basis. The audit committee has delegated specific pre-approval to the chairperson of the audit committee, provided the estimated fee of the proposed service does not exceed $100,000. The chairperson also has the authority to approve any actual or expected cost overruns relating to any pre-approved services provided the additional fees do not exceed $100,000. 
The chairperson must report any decisions made pursuant to these delegations to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. Periodically, but not less than quarterly, our controller provides the audit committee with a report of audit and non-audit services provided and expected to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. A copy of our audit and non-audit services policy is available on our website.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. The audit committee reviews CME Group's financial reporting process on behalf of the board. Management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements and for the public reporting process. Ernst & Young, our company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the company's internal control over financial reporting. A copy of the audit committee charter, which has been adopted by our board of directors and further describes the role of the audit committee in overseeing our financial reporting process, is on our website under Investor Relations—Corporate Governance—Board Committees. 
REQUIRED DISCLOSURES AND DISCUSSION. The audit committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and Ernst & Young's evaluation of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters that are required to be discussed under the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards. Ernst & Young has provided to the committee the written disclosures and the PCAOB-required letter regarding its communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the committee has discussed with Ernst & Young that firm's independence. The committee has concluded that Ernst & Young's provision of audit and non-audit services to CME Group is compatible with Ernst & Young's independence. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC. This report is provided by the following independent directors, who currently comprise the audit committee: 
Dennis H. Chookaszian, Chairman 
Jeffrey M. Bernacchi

      ITEM 3—Advisory Vote on the  Compensation   of our Named Executive Officers   
      ITEM 3—Advisory Vote on the  Compensation   of our Named Executive Officers   
[END TABLE]
You are being asked to vote on a non-binding advisory proposal on our executive compensation program for our named executive officers as described in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 37 and Executive Compensation tables beginning on page 54. 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ADVISORY PROPOSAL ON 
THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
FACTORS TO CONSIDER 
The board and the compensation committee are committed to sound governance practices and recognize the interest our shareholders have expressed in CME Group's executive compensation program. As part of that commitment, and pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our shareholders are being asked to approve an advisory resolution on the compensation of the named executive officers, as reported in this proxy statement. 
This proposal, commonly known as the "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you the opportunity to endorse our 2018 executive compensation program and policies for the named executive officers through a vote "FOR" the approval of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CME Group approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of CME Group's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC in the proxy statement for the CME Group 2019 annual shareholders meeting (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Executive Compensation tables and any related material). 
We currently hold our advisory "say-on-pay" proposal every year. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather our overall compensation policies and procedures relating to the named executive officers. Accordingly, your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit any existing compensation or award arrangement of any of the named executive officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the board. The board and the compensation committee, however, will take into account the outcome of the "say-on-pay" vote when considering future compensation arrangements. 
REQUIRED VOTE 
This item must receive a "FOR" vote from the holders of a majority of the shares of our Class A and Class B common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this matter at the annual meeting, voting together as a single class, to be approved.

Our Class B-1 shareholders are being asked to vote for three Class B-1 directors, our Class B-2 shareholders are being asked to vote for two Class B-2 directors and our Class B-3 shareholders are being asked to vote for one Class B-3 director. Each Class B director's term will last until the 2020 annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. 
OUR BOARD IS NOT PROVIDING ANY RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW OUR CLASS B SHAREHOLDERS 
SHOULD VOTE ON THE ELECTION OF CLASS B-1, CLASS B-2 AND CLASS B-3 DIRECTORS 
If you own more than one share of Class B-1, Class B-2 or Class B-3 common stock, you must vote each class of your Class B-1 shares, Class B-2 shares and/or Class B-3 shares the same way. You may not split your vote. If you do so, your vote will be invalid. 
In order to hold a valid election of the Class B director(s) elected by a particular class, a quorum of that class (holders of at least one-third of the outstanding shares of that class) must be present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. From time to time, at the time of the annual meeting, the quorum required for a particular class was not satisfied. At previous annual meetings, the company elected to adjourn the election for a class that did not satisfy the quorum requirement in order to allow for the solicitation of more votes. At the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, if a quorum is not present for one or more of the proposals under Item 4 or Item 5, the company does not intend to adjourn the meeting. In the absence of a quorum, no valid election can take place under our charter and bylaws. As a consequence, the Class B directors serving on the board of the affected class at the time of the annual meeting would become "holdovers" under Delaware law and our bylaws, and would continue to serve until their successors are duly elected at the 2020 annual meeting or their earlier resignation or removal. The Class B nominating committee members of that class would also be deemed to continue to serve until their successors are duly elected at the 2020 annual meeting. 
CLASS B DIRECTOR NOMINEES 
Ages of the nominees are as of March 11, 2019, and the nominee's trading badge symbol is shown in parenthesis. 
CLASS B-1 DIRECTOR NOMINEES (Class B-1 Shares only)

REQUIRED VOTE 
The five nominees for the Class B-3 nominating committee receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes will be elected. 
This section provides an overview of the role and responsibility of our compensation committee. We have an executive compensation program that is designed to tie pay to performance, balance rewards with prudent business decisions and risk management, and focus on both annual and long-term performance for the benefit of our shareholders. In designing our program, we also take into consideration our unique role in the financial services industry. 
OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PROVIDES OVERSIGHT OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT GROUP 
The compensation committee is composed of six independent directors. The primary responsibilities of the compensation committee are to review and approve compensation arrangements for our senior management group (our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the other members of our management team), to review and recommend compensation arrangements for the board of directors, to adopt incentive compensation plans in which senior management is eligible to participate and to oversee matters relating to employee compensation, employee benefit plans and employee incentive programs. A complete description of the committee's responsibilities may be found in its charter, a copy of which is on our website. 
There were seven meetings of the committee in 2018. The committee typically meets in executive session for a portion of each regular committee meeting and may include members of management as appropriate. The committee provides regular reports to the board of directors on its activities. 
In November 2018, the company completed the acquisition of NEX. As a result, the compensation committee began overseeing matters relating to legacy NEX employee compensation, employee benefit plans and employee incentive programs, including matters relating to the integration of NEX programs into CME Group programs, which is expected to be complete in 2020. 
THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN APPROVING COMPENSATION FOR OUR OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
The committee is solely responsible for approving the compensation of our executive officers. The committee, however, takes into consideration the recommendations of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in approving compensation for executive officers other than himself. 
THE COMMITTEE DELEGATES AUTHORITY TO OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ON A LIMITED BASIS SUBJECT TO PRE-ESTABLISHED CRITERIA 
Subject to pre-established guidelines for individual awards and aggregate value limitations, the committee delegates authority to the individual in the role of Chief Executive Officer to approve salary increases, equity awards and annual cash bonus awards for employees other than the executive officers. The committee reviews annual reports on the use of such delegation. 
OUR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CREATE LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE WHILE DISCOURAGING EXCESSIVE RISK TAKING 
We realize that it is not possible to grow and enhance long-term shareholder value without assuming some level of risk. This is true whether we decide to make an acquisition, introduce a new product or change our corporate strategy. Our compensation program is designed to provide appropriate incentives for creating long-term shareholder value and delivering on our financial and strategic goals while discouraging excessive risk taking. 
Several elements of our program, which are discussed in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 37, are designed to promote the creation of long-term value and thereby discourage behavior that leads to excessive risk taking. The following are the key elements of our program designed to address compensation risk: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We utilize a mix of both fixed and variable compensation. Our fixed pay is intended to provide a stable income.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of our senior management group compensation is composed of long-term equity incentives and the senior  management group is also subject to company stock ownership guidelines based on their level of responsibility.

• Our annual cash bonus plan for our senior management group and other senior employees as currently in effect will not pay  out in the event we fail to achieve cash earnings at or above the threshold level of performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We set maximum guidelines for annual incentive and long-term incentive awards, thereby establishing and communicating  potential payouts.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All compensation of our senior management group is subject to the approval of the compensation committee, which includes the  ability to decrease an award for failure to perform or inappropriate risk taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have adopted a recoupment policy, whereby employees at the level of managing director and above may be required to repay  any previously granted annual bonus awards to the extent that all or a portion of such individual's award was not actually earned due to a restatement of our financial results with the outcome being the achievement of the related performance  metric was less than previously reported.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We prohibit all of our employees and board members from engaging in any derivative transactions in our securities (hedging  the economic risk of their ownership of our stock) and have adopted a policy restricting the pledging of our Class A shares by our board members and executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As discussed below, the committee engages its independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation best  practices and to provide counsel as it considers executive compensation programs and arrangements, as it deems appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT 
The committee has engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC to serve as its independent advisor. During 2018, Meridian provided information on trends in executive compensation as well as general executive compensation advice. They also advised on proposed changes to director compensation to ensure alignment with the competitive market. 
In mid-2018, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP & Affiliates, who serves as outside counsel for the company, advised the committee regarding the revised employment agreement with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
Management also engages its own consultants to provide advice as it relates to compensation programs. In 2018, management engaged Exequity LLP for information on executive compensation practices as well as technical guidance on executive compensation matters. 
Such consultants may attend compensation committee meetings and provide advice to the compensation committee. The committee at its discretion may also include its independent advisor in such reviews and decision-making processes, meeting either jointly or separately from management and management's consultant. 
The committee has assessed the independence of the advisors it engaged in 2018 relative to the factors identified by the SEC and Nasdaq. 
OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF INDEPENDENT MEMBERS WITH LIMITED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMPANY (COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION) 
During 2018, none of the members of the compensation committee served at any time as an officer or employee of CME Group or received any compensation from us other than in the capacity as a member of the board or a committee. Except as described below regarding Mr. Shepard, none of the members of the compensation committee has any relationship with us other than service as a director or member of one of our exchanges. Mr. Shepard owns a minority interest in one of our clearing firms, which made net payments to us of approximately $147 million, and he owns a trading firm that made indirect payments to us through its clearing firm in excess of $120,000 in connection with trading activity conducted on our exchanges in 2018. Such fees are consistent with those prevailing at the time for corresponding activity by other similarly situated unrelated third parties. No interlocking relationship exists between the members of our board or the compensation committee and the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company. 
This discussion provides you with a detailed description of our compensation program for our named executive officers. It also provides an overview of our compensation philosophy and our policies and programs, which are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, and an overview of our program as it relates to other members of our management team. These individuals along with our named executive officers are referred to as our senior management group.

Opportunity for shareholder feedback

At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 93% of shareholders voted FOR the approval of our non-binding advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers. 
Shareholders who wish to directly communicate with members of the compensation committee may do so using directors@cmegroup.com as discussed on page 20of this proxy statement.

2018 compensation highlights for our named executive officers 
The compensation committee took the following compensation actions with respect to our named executive officers during 2018 or related to 2018 performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Entered into a revised employment agreement with Mr. Duffy in May 2018. The details of the revised employment agreement  can be found on page 59.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awarded base salary increases to certain named executive officers to better align their compensation to market competitive  levels as described on page 45.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awarded bonuses to our named executive officers based on our achievement of 2018 cash earnings at 115% of the target goal as  described beginning on page 46. For 2018, we set a cash earnings goal that required significant effort on behalf of our management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Certified results for the September 2015 award of performance shares based on net income margin growth relative to the  diversified financial services index of the S&P 500 and total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 for the 2016-2018 performance period. Due to outstanding achievement against both goals, 200% of the target number of shares were earned  and became vested in March 2019 as described on page 48.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awarded performance-granted restricted shares to Mr. Duffy based on the company's 2018 relative total shareholder  return achievement at the 93.4 percentile of the S&P 500. This award is time-vested and the number of shares subject to the award was determined based on the achievement of the performance  targets and granted in March 2019. The performance-granted restricted shares are described on page 49.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awarded equity grants to our named executive officers in September 2018 to encourage longer-term retention while also  increasing the focus on longer-term value creation. The 2018 equity awards were comprised of 50% time-vested restricted stock and 50% performance shares, as described on page 48.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approved the use of a single metric, relative total shareholder return, for performance share awards granted in 2018 and  awarded performance shares to our named executive officers in September 2018 tied to our total shareholder return as compared to the S&P 500 measured over a three-year period (2019-2021), as described on page 48.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In 2018, at least 50% of target total compensation for each of our named executive officers was considered  performance-based, as it was directly tied to cash earnings or relative stock performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
Key elements of the program are designed to ensure pay for performance 
Our overall goals and philosophy are complemented by several specific elements that are designed to align the compensation for our senior management group with our performance and position the company for creating long-term shareholder value including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual bonus is tied to our generation of cash earnings. To the extent we fail to achieve cash earnings at the threshold  level, representing 25% below the target, no bonuses would be paid to our senior management group. The bonus opportunities for our named executive officers are set forth on page 46. We believe the cash earnings metric is a key  component to measuring our growth and contributes directly to deriving value for our shareholders as it is the metric used for determining our regular quarterly dividend payments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The aggregate amount of our bonus pool is subject to an overall cap when we achieve cash earnings at the maximum level,  representing 20% above the established target. We believe this cap provides transparency to our investors as to our compensation exposure and the expected expense is accrued on a quarterly basis based on actual cash earnings performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition to verifying the annual achievement of cash earnings for purposes of our bonus program, our compensation  committee also considers other elements of our performance, such as our net income, total shareholder return, earnings per share and return on equity, as appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual long-term incentive awards for our senior management group are comprised of 50% time-vested restricted shares and  50% performance shares. The performance shares have a three-year performance period with total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 as the performance metric. This performance metric, when combined with the cash earnings performance metric  in our annual bonus plan, focuses our senior management group on financial and operational measures of success and shareholder results. The annual equity award opportunities for our named executive officers are set forth on page 47.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our senior management group is subject to stock ownership guidelines as discussed on page 51.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To ensure alignment with our shareholders, we have a policy that prohibits all employees and board members from engaging in  any hedging or other derivative transactions with respect to CME Group stock as well as a policy which restricts pledging of our Class A common stock by our board members and executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Overview of pay and performance alignment 
One of the guiding principles of our compensation program is to focus on achievement that benefits us and our shareholders. In support of that objective, a significant portion of the pay package for our named executive officers is delivered in the form of stock-based compensation, the value of which rises and falls in alignment with our stock performance. 
The following graphic depicts the alignment of the total pay of the individual serving as Chief Executive Officer at the end of the applicable year with our total shareholder return and cash earnings achievement for each of the last five years (Mr. Gill for 2014-2015 and Mr. Duffy for 2016-2018). Total shareholder return (TSR) is shown on a year-over-year, indexed basis. Specifically, an investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock on December 31, 2014 and its performance is tracked through December 31, 2018. 
Chief Executive Officer pay, as depicted in the following graphic, is the sum of reported pay elements set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for each of the last five years except for the values of stock option, restricted stock, and performance share awards which are included as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of stock option awards is shown as (1) the value realized at exercise for any options exercised during the  year as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table, and (2) the value of all outstanding, in-the-money stock options at year end measured as the  positive difference between our stock price at year end minus the option exercise price.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of restricted stock awards is shown as (1) the value realized on vesting for any shares that vested during  the year as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table, and (2) the value of all outstanding restricted shares at year end measured using our stock price at year end.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of performance share awards is shown as (1) the value realized on vesting for any earned shares that vested  during the year as reported in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table, and (2) the market value of the shares actually earned at the completion of the performance period which had not yet vested, as reported in the Outstanding  Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End table, and as certified by the committee based on achievement of the performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
While the Summary Compensation Table discloses the fair value of stock option, restricted stock and performance share awards on the grant date in the manner required by the SEC (for purposes of allocating the accounting expense over the requisite service period), we feel those values do not reflect the value actually received as a result of actual stock and financial performance. We believe the value of stock option, restricted stock and performance share awards as shown in this section better reflects the true alignment of our Chief Executive Officers' pay with our stock performance. As the graphic shows, our Chief Executive Officers' total actual pay plus the unrealized value of his outstanding equity awards at year end has been aligned with TSR over the last five years, which accords with the primary objectives of our executive compensation program. 
On balance, Chief Executive Officer pay shows alignment with both stock performance and cash earnings given the focus on these measures in our incentive opportunities.

Our program is designed to be consistent with best practices 
The compensation committee designs our compensation program to motivate our senior management group to lead our entire company toward achieving short- and long-term financial and strategic goals, in addition to increasing shareholder value, all without encouraging excessive risk taking. The committee continually evaluates what it considers to be best practices in executive compensation, and modifies our program to support our strategies and provide an appropriate balance of risk and reward. The following highlights our current compensation practices that we believe drive performance and focus our senior management group on the creation of long-term value: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We tie pay to performance. In 2018, at least 50% of the target total compensation opportunity for our named executive  officers was tied to specific cash earnings or relative total shareholder return performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We set objective targets tied to company performance for our cash bonus that must be met at the threshold level in order to  fund the bonus pool.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We mitigate undue risk, including utilizing caps on potential payouts and clawback provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have reasonable post-employment and change of control provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We use employment contracts on a limited basis. Contracts are generally structured to include a three- to five-year term, do  not provide for excessive severance payments or include "golden parachute" tax gross ups.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have adopted stock ownership guidelines and restrictions on hedging and pledging transactions to ensure our  executives' interests are linked to those of our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide only modest perquisites.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation committee reviews the reasonableness of our compensation by reviewing "tally" sheets and wealth  accumulation reports.  
[END TABLE]
USE OF COMPETITIVE DATA AND COMPARISON PRACTICES 
Benchmarking practices 
We are a complex organization that seeks to attract talent from a broad group of companies primarily located in the financial services industry and within the technology sector. Because no individual company or single group of companies is exactly comparable to CME Group, when reviewing competitive data, we consider a broad set of data from a number of sources. We believe that reviewing a combination of published survey compensation data in addition to publicly available compensation data (e.g. proxy statements) provides a valid reference point for the range of pay among companies with whom we compete for executive talent. 
We broadly target compensation opportunities at the median (50th percentile) of the market, in total and for each component of pay for target performance levels. However, we believe that benchmarking does not provide a complete basis for establishing compensation. Therefore, we do not use the market statistics rigidly, nor do we apply any specific formula to the data. We also review the range of values around the median, including the 25th and 75th percentiles. 
We use the competitive compensation data for several purposes as it relates to the named executive officers and other employees. We use it to assess the competitiveness of total compensation for individual members of senior management and other employees on an annual basis, and we use it to develop and evaluate total compensation programs and guidelines for senior management and other employees on a more ad hoc basis. When making decisions about senior management pay we analyze compensation relative to the market median levels, and may make adjustments for market conditions and special considerations as appropriate in the context of our pay for performance philosophy. The compensation committee, within its discretion, may make alterations based on its evaluation of the benchmarking data, as it deems appropriate, to ensure that our senior management compensation is performance-based and competitive in nature. 
CME Group compensation peer group 
The following peer group was used for benchmarking our program for senior management and members of our board in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CBOE Holdings Inc.     Equifax Inc. 
 E*Trade Financial Corporation     Fiserv Inc. 
 Franklin Resources Inc.     Intercontinental Exchange Inc. 
 Invesco Ltd.     MasterCard Inc. 
 Moody's Corp.     Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. 
 Northern Trust Corp.     Paychex Inc. 
 Schwab (Charles) Corp.     S&P Global, Inc. 
 T. Rowe Price Group Inc.     TD AMERITRADE Holding Corp. 
 Western Union Co.      
[END TABLE]
In selecting the peer group for executive compensation purposes, we targeted the following industries: exchanges, financial services, technology, transaction services and other technology-driven financial companies. We selected companies within these sectors of similar size as measured by revenue and market capitalization. The companies within the peer group generally range between 0.5 and 2.5 times CME Group in terms of revenues or market capitalization. At the time of the committee's annual review of key financial and performance measures of our peer group companies in 2018, CME Group was positioned at the 26th percentile of the peer group on revenue and at the 91st percentile on market capitalization. 
Comparison of Chief Executive Officer pay to other named executive officers 
The differences between the allocation of compensation of the individual serving in the role of Chief Executive Officer and the other named executive officers are primarily the result of the differences in the role and responsibilities of the individual within the organization, the level of competitive demand for the individual's talent in the industry and the results of our benchmarking studies for similarly situated positions in the marketplace. We have not adopted a policy whereby the compensation of the individual serving in the role of Chief Executive Officer or any other named executive officer must be a certain multiple higher or lower than any of the other named executive officers. As previously discussed, we broadly target total compensation levels at the median (50th percentile) of our peer group. 
Role of individual performance in the program 
While consideration of compensation data to ensure that our compensation is competitive is a critical component of compensation decisions, individual performance is factored into setting compensation in the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual's performance in the preceding year, changes in  his or her responsibilities as well as a comparison with market data for comparable positions in our peer group and within the industry.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our incentive targets for annual bonus and equity opportunities are based on the individual's role and responsibilities  in the organization in achieving our annual goals as well as the competitive market data for similarly situated positions in the marketplace.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individual performance and the achievement of specific goals is taken into consideration by the compensation committee in  determining whether to use its discretion in approving annual bonuses and equity awards at, above or below the target level.

[END TABLE]
We do not maintain formal targets for the allocation of total compensation through each of the foregoing elements. We believe that members of our senior management who have more direct responsibility for the performance of CME Group should have a greater percentage of their compensation tied to the performance of CME Group. In accordance with this philosophy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary should represent a lower percentage of overall compensation as employees gain more responsibility with more  direct influence over our performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employees in positions that most directly influence performance should have a larger percentage of their compensation tied  to CME Group's performance through equity awards with a portion of the equity awards tied to corporate performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Actual awards of incentive compensation should be closely aligned with the performance of CME Group.  
[END TABLE]
The following are the approximate average percentages the elements represent out of the total compensation for our named executive officers for 2018 as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table:

Description of each element of compensation 
Base salary 
We generally target base salary at the 50th percentile of the competitive market relative to each position's duties and level of responsibility. Each year the compensation committee reviews the base salaries of the senior management group taking into consideration their total compensation. In general, the evaluation of base salaries involves a review of a variety of factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The nature and responsibility of the position.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The impact, contribution, expertise and experience of the individual.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive market information regarding salaries to the extent available and relevant.  
[END TABLE]

• The importance of retaining the individual along with the competitiveness of the market for the individual's talent and  services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recommendations of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (except in the case of his own compensation).   
[END TABLE]
Mr. Pietrowicz received a base salary increase from $500,000 to $550,000 effective January 1, 2018, to better align his compensation with market levels. Mr. Durkin's salary was increased from $800,000 to $900,000 effective January 1, 2018, in connection with his increased responsibilities as President. Ms. Holzrichter received a salary increase from $450,000 to $475,000 effective January 1, 2018, and from $475,000 to $500,000 effective January 1, 2019, to better align her compensation with market levels. 
Bonus 
Our annual bonus program is designed to provide incentives to the named executive officers and other members of senior management to drive annual performance based on our strategic goals as approved by the board. In support of our pay-for-performance philosophy, the bonus plan is only funded when we achieve cash earnings at or above the threshold level. We use cash earnings as our funding metric because we believe it provides a transparent view of CME Group's performance during the year. Cash earnings is also the metric used in our dividend policy, which provides that our dividend target for our regular quarterly dividends is set at approximately 50% to 60% of the prior year's cash earnings. 
On an annual basis, the cash earnings target is approved by our compensation committee. The cash earnings target is established to motivate our named executive officers toward operational excellence and superior financial performance and is designed to be challenging to meet, while remaining achievable with concentrated effort and focus. Annual bonuses will only be paid to our senior management group to the extent we achieve cash earnings at or above the threshold level, which was set at 25% below the target performance goal for 2018. The annual bonus pool is subject to a cap when we achieve cash earnings at the maximum level, which is set at 20% above the established target goal. It is anticipated that the achievement of the maximum level of cash earnings would be exceptional, requiring extraordinary effort on the part of our senior management.

The compensation committee has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the cash earnings performance calculation to reflect effects of external events outside the control of our senior management group, such as unforeseen litigation or changes in accounting or taxation standards. Such adjustments may also reflect the effects of unusual or significant strategic events that are within the control of our senior management that were not contemplated at the time the goal was established and that were undertaken with an expectation of improving our long-term financial performance, such as acquisitions or strategic relationships. In 2018, the committee approved adjustments for certain non-performance items, such as deferred tax and foreign exchange fluctuation impacts, as well as related to our acquisition of NEX, consistent with prior practice. 
2018 bonus awards 
Annual bonus opportunities are based upon CME Group's achievement of cash earnings and are awarded in consideration of the individual's performance during the year. The committee approved the bonuses for the named executive officers for 2018 based on our achievement of cash earnings and in recognition of the previously discussed accomplishments set forth on page 1.

(1)  Under the terms of our bonus program, bonus awards are calculated utilizing base salary paid during the applicable plan  year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Messrs. Pietrowicz, Durkin and Ms. Holzrichter received base salary increases effective January 1, 2018 as  discussed on page 45. No other named executive officers received increases to base salary in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 actual annual cash earnings results were 115.0% of the target level performance. As such, bonuses for the named executive officers were approved by the committee at approximately 175% of their individual bonus target opportunities. The bonuses for all named executive officers were delivered at the level determined by cash earnings performance, without any additional discretion applied by the committee. 
Equity 
Long-term grants of equity are important to reflect an alignment with shareholder value creation and a competitive mix of long- and short-term incentives. Our equity program is designed to reward and encourage the success and contributions of our employees, including our named executive officers, which leads to value creation for CME Group and our shareholders. 
Since 2012, the annual equity awards for members of our senior management group have been delivered in the form of performance shares and time-vested restricted stock. This mix of equity vehicles enables us to focus employees on stock performance, provides for employee retention and directly aligns employee interests with shareholder value creation. 
Equity grant practices 
The following is a summary of our equity grant practices and the role of the committee in approving awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual equity awards are granted on September 15th or in the  event the 15th is not a business day, the closest business day thereto.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At a meeting prior to the annual grant date, the committee approves the awards for the senior management group based upon  the target equity opportunities and recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer using a pre-set calculation of a percentage of base salary and a recent closing price. Actual awards are  granted based on the previously approved calculation and the closing price on the actual grant date. The committee receives a report of the actual awards at a subsequent meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The committee has delegated authority to the individual in the role of Chief Executive Officer to approve annual, sign-on, retention and initiative-based equity awards to employees below our senior management group other than our chief accounting officer, within parameters set by the committee. The committee is provided with an  annual report on awards granted under such delegated authority.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Omnibus Stock Plan and our Director Stock Plan prohibit the granting of options or stock appreciation rights below the  market value on the date of grant, the repricing of existing awards, and payment of dividends on performance-based shares prior to the achievement of performance goals. Dividends relating to outstanding shares of unvested time-based restricted stock  are accrued and paid out at vesting.  
[END TABLE]
The equity targets for our named executive officers were established based upon a review of the nature of the responsibility of the position of the executive within CME Group, the competitive market data derived through our benchmarking practices and the ability of the employee to impact the overall growth and performance of CME Group based upon his or her role within the company. As discussed in more detail on page 42, we generally target total compensation in the 50th percentile of our peer group. Through competitive compensation analysis, we compare equity compensation on a standalone basis as well as part of an executive's overall total compensation. 
The committee has the discretion to adjust the annual equity awards to distinguish for individual performance. The annual equity awards for the named executive officers were made at the target levels for 2018 and were comprised of 50% performance shares and 50% time-vested restricted stock. 
The table below shows the annual equity award opportunities for our named executive officers and actual awards made in 2018.

Performance shares tied to 2019-2021 performance 
The September 2018 performance share awards were based solely on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500, measured over 2019 through 2021. Historically, performance share awards were tied to a second financial metric, most recently net income margin growth relative to the diversified financial services index of the S&P 500. However, with the mid-year acquisition of NEX, setting the net income baseline for the combined company would require a significant use of judgment. For 2018, the committee approved the use of a single metric for performance share awards with a plan to revisit performance metrics prior to the 2019 grants to ensure ongoing performance metrics are aligned with longer term measures of success for the combined company. Following the three-year performance period, the award will be settled in unrestricted shares of stock, based upon achievement of the following performance metric:

Performance shares tied to 2016-2018 performance 
Certain members of our senior management group received performance share awards in September 2015 for the performance period 2016 through 2018, with 50% based on growth in net income margin relative to the diversified financial services index of the S&P 500 and 50% based on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500. The company achieved 96th percentile growth in net income margin relative to the diversified financial services index of the S&P 500 for the performance period, exceeding the target goal of 50th percentile and the maximum goal of 75th percentile. The company achieved 97th percentile total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 for the performance period, exceeding the target goal of 50th percentile and the maximum goal of 75th percentile. Performance on both of these metrics resulted in an above-target payout of 200% of the total target performance shares being earned. 
The following table shows total payout opportunities of the previously granted annual performance shares tied to 2016 through 2018 performance based on the range of performance against the established metrics, and actual shares earned when performance was certified by the committee in early 2019.

In addition to annual equity awards, certain members of senior management may be eligible to receive initiative-based equity awards based upon their contributions to select key corporate initiatives. Participation in such awards is at the recommendation of the individual serving in the role of Chief Executive Officer, subject to approval by the compensation committee. We did not grant any such initiative-based awards to our named executive officers in 2018. 
Performance-based grant of restricted stock 
In lieu of participation in our initiative-based equity program, Mr. Duffy is eligible to receive an annual grant of time-vested restricted stock with a value of up to 100% of his base salary based upon the achievement of outstanding performance as measured based on cash earnings and total shareholder return over the prior year:

(1)  The compensation committee certified performance results associated with the 2018 cash earnings goal and the 2018 TSR  performance relative to the S&P 500 goal on February 6, 2019 and approved the award to be granted on March 15, 2019. Based on the committee's certification, the pre-established goal  associated with the TSR performance was achieved, and the maximum TSR payout opportunity was earned.  
[END TABLE]
Performance-granted restricted shares were awarded to Mr. Duffy on March 15, 2018 associated with the 2017 achievement of total shareholder return performance at the 75.2 percentile of the S&P 500. The committee certified the performance and approved the award of time-vested restricted shares on February 7, 2018. This award of 92 shares has a four-year vesting schedule, with 25% vesting one year after the grant date and 25% vesting on each anniversary thereafter. 
Health and Welfare Plans and Retirement Plans 
All eligible employees, including the named executive officers, participate in our benefit programs. We provide health and wellness benefits, including medical and dental coverage, disability insurance benefits based on two-thirds of base salary and life insurance benefits based on three times base salary. In addition, employees are eligible to participate in our qualified retirement plans, which consist of our 401(k) savings plan and our cash balance pension plan. 
In addition to the qualified retirement plans, employees whose pay exceeds the compensation limits for qualified benefit plans set by the Internal Revenue Service participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation plan which provides for "make-whole" contributions. For more information on our deferred compensation plans, see Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans beginning on page 58. 
Qualified and non-qualified retirement benefits provided to the named executive officers are set forth in the following tables: Pension Benefits and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans on pages 58 and 59, respectively. 
PERQUISITES AND OTHER PERSONAL BENEFITS 
We provide limited perquisites and other personal benefits to our senior management that we believe are moderate and consistent with our overall compensation program. We provide monthly parking benefits to a subset of our senior management group, including Mr. Duffy and Ms. Holzrichter. Additionally, all of our senior level employees are entitled to an annual physical examination. From time to time, we may pay the cost, if any, for an executive's or board member's guest to attend a CME Group business-related event where such attendance is expected or customary. In addition, occasionally, family members of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may accompany him on business-related travel, provided there is no incremental cost. The aggregate value of all perquisites received by each named executive officer in 2018 did not exceed $10,000. To the extent that perquisites result in imputed income to the individual, we do not provide gross-up payments to cover the personal income tax due on such imputed income. 
POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
Our employment contracts contain reasonable provisions and ensure continuity of leadership 
Our philosophy is to enter into employment contracts and retention agreements on a very selective basis in light of the particular facts and circumstances involved in the individual employment relationship, such as whether the employment arrangement would be necessary to recruit and/or retain necessary talent with compensation terms that we believe are in accordance with our overall compensation program. Employment agreements typically are for a period of three to five years, include non-compete and non-solicitation provisions, do not provide for cash severance payments in excess of two times annual base salary, do not provide for gross-up payments (except in connection with certain self-insured supplemental life insurance payments that would be paid to Mr. Duffy's beneficiaries under his agreement) and include a requirement that the executive execute a release agreement before becoming entitled to receive severance payments. All contractual compensation terms within the employment agreements for our senior management group are reviewed and approved by the compensation committee. We believe that our existing employment contract with Mr. Duffy contains compensation terms in line with our overall compensation program and philosophy. A description of the agreement is set forth in the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control—Employment Agreements and other Compensation Arrangements with Named Executive Officers beginning on page 59. 
We have reasonable change-in-control and other termination provisions 
Change-in-control provisions assist us with retention during rumored and actual change of control activity when management continuity is key to preserving the value of the business. We also provide other severance benefits in connection with terminations other than for misconduct. We believe these benefits allow us to facilitate changes with key employees, as needed, and to ensure minimal disruption to the business in exchange for non-competition and non-solicitation benefits for CME Group along with a general release. 
A description of our severance policies and practices and the estimated amounts that would be payable to our named executive officers under certain circumstances are set forth under the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control beginning on page 59. 
OTHER COMPENSATION POLICIES 
We have established stock ownership guidelines to ensure alignment of interests with our shareholders 
The committee has established the following stock ownership guidelines for the members of our senior management group: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: shares with a value equal to at least a multiple of five times base salary.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other named executive officers: shares with a value equal to at least a multiple of three times their respective base  salary.  
[END TABLE]
Each individual has five years from the date of hire or promotion to achieve their ownership guideline. As of the 2018 review, all of our named executive officers had satisfied the guidelines. 
The compensation committee monitors compliance with these stock ownership guidelines on an annual basis. Generally, shares that are deemed "owned" for purposes of Section 16 of the SEC regulations are counted towards satisfaction of these guidelines. Shares are valued based upon the greater of (i) the fair market value at the time of the assessment and (ii) the actual value at the time of acquisition or, in the case of restricted stock or performance shares, at the time of vesting. 
We prohibit derivative transactions and hedging of ownership risk of our securities and have adopted a policy restricting the pledging of our Class A shares 
To ensure alignment of interests between our employees and board members and our shareholders and to further ensure that such individuals share in the risks and rewards of the ownership of our stock, we prohibit our employees and members of the board from engaging in any derivative or hedging transactions relative to their ownership of our stock. The board also has adopted a policy prohibiting pledging of our Class A shares. In connection with the adoption of the policy, the board elected to grandfather in the existing pledging arrangements of certain directors based on the fact that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The aggregate number of shares pledged was significantly less than 0.1% of our outstanding Class A common stock.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The secured parties each had undertaken not to sell such pledged shares during any period in which the board members were  restricted from trading under our compliance policies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The board members agreed to own shares not subject to any pledging arrangement with a value that meets their applicable  stock ownership guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The pledging arrangements were related to such individual's derivatives trading activities at CME Group.

Since the approval of the policy, only one of the grandfathered arrangements remains in existence. 
Our compensation committee and board annually review the total compensation of our senior management 
To ensure the committee members are informed of the potential compensation levels of our senior management group, the committee reviews on an annual basis all components of their compensation package and total compensation. This review includes annual base salary, annual cash bonus, value of annual equity awards, in-the-money value of all historic equity grants including monetized gains, the value of retirement contributions under our qualified and non-qualified plans, and potential change-in-control payments. The committee provides an annual report on the results of this review to the board during an executive session. For more information on the operation of our compensation committee see page 35. 
We have implemented a recoupment policy 
In furtherance of our philosophy to ensure the interests of our senior management are aligned with those of our shareholders, effective as of 2010, the compensation committee recommended, and the board approved, a recoupment policy. This policy provides the board with the discretion to recoup annual bonus payments to our employees at the level of managing director and above in the event of a financial restatement, the effect of which is that such incentive payments were not otherwise earned by an individual under our bonus programs based upon the restated calculation of our cash earnings or any other performance metric in effect at the time. In July 2015, the SEC proposed rules to implement the recoupment provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We plan to amend our recoupment policy as necessary to comply with the final rules. 
The compensation committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with our management. After such discussions, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(5)  As discussed under the section entitled Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control—Employment Agreements and other Compensation Arrangements with Named Executive Officers on page 59, we have agreed to self-insure supplemental life and long-term  disability coverage for Mr. Duffy and to gross up his beneficiaries for any additional taxes incurred as a result of the supplemental life coverage. Because no actual payments were made or liabilities incurred as a result of this coverage, no  amounts have been included in Mr. Duffy's compensation in respect of such coverage.

PENSION BENEFITS 
We maintain a non-contributory defined benefit cash balance pension plan for eligible employees. To be eligible, an employee must have completed a continuous 12-month period of employment with us and have reached the age of 21. Our funding goal is to have the pension plan 100% funded on a projected benefit obligation basis, while also satisfying any minimum required contributions and maximizing tax deductible contribution requirements. 
Participants are fully vested in their accounts after three years of service. Once an employee becomes a participant in the pension plan, their notional pension account is credited with an amount equal to an age-based percentage of that individual's earnings plus the greater of 4% interest or the December yield on one-year constant maturity yield for U.S. Treasury notes. During 2018, the pension plan interest rate was 4%. The pension account is portable and vested balances may be paid out in a lump sum when participants end their employment with us. Alternatively, upon retirement, a participant may elect to receive the balance in the account in the form of one of various monthly annuities. 
The following is the schedule of employer contributions based on age and percentage of pensionable pay (including base salary, regular annual bonuses and merit lump sum payments) under our pension plan. Pensionable pay is limited by the Code, which imposed a limit of $275,000 in 2018:

(1)  In calculating the present value of the accumulated benefit, the following assumptions were used: assumed retirement age  of 65; discount rate of 4.4% as of December 31, 2018; and projected future investment crediting rate assumption of 4% as of December 31, 2018. The normal retirement age as defined in our pension plan is 65 years of age with 5 years of  service. Under the terms of our pension plan, years of service for purposes of the plan are credited beginning on the first day of the calendar quarter on or after attaining one year of service with CME Group. Therefore, years of credited service  under the plan are less than an employee's actual period of service with CME Group.

NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 
All of our senior level employees, including our named executive officers, are eligible to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of their bonus into our Senior Management Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan. The contributions made by our named executive officers under this plan in 2018 are shown in the table below under "Executive Contributions." Deferrals may be invested in one or more market-based investments offered by the plan from time to time at the choice of the individual. The return on their investment choice is the only return they will receive on the contributions under the plan. We do not provide any guaranteed rate of return. There is no limitation on their ability to change investments. Distributions will be on a fixed date, at termination or six months after termination, depending upon the time of the distribution election and the requirements of applicable law. 
The deferred savings plan also includes 401(k) make-whole and pension make-whole contributions. Make-whole contributions are company contributions for individuals whose compensation has exceeded the statutory compensation limit identified in the Code and thus must be excluded from consideration in qualified retirement plans. These amounts are included in the table below under "Registrant Contributions." The aggregate balance at year end in the table below includes the balance the named executive officer may have in the Senior Management Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
In 2018, we had an employment agreement in place with Mr. Duffy. The contractual commitments under this agreement are summarized below. For our named executive officers other than Mr. Duffy, their employment relationships are governed by our policies and practices that we have in place for other employees from time to time, including members of senior management. In addition, for the named executive officers other than Mr. Duffy, their post-employment benefits are governed by the Senior Management Severance Protection Agreements that were put in place in 2016 and described on page 60. Estimated termination payments to our named executive officers under our employment and severance protection agreements and general policies are shown in the table beginning on page 62. 
Employment Agreements and other Compensation Arrangements with Named Executive Officers 
Duffy Employment Agreement 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, our philosophy is to enter into employment contracts or other agreements on a very selective basis in light of the particular facts and circumstances involved in the individual employment relationship. The following is a summary of the key terms of our employment agreement with Mr. Duffy, which was most recently amended and restated on May 8, 2018. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the employment agreement, which was filed with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K on May 9, 2018. 
Agreement Term:December 31, 2022. 
Minimum Base Salary: $1,500,000 per year. 
Annual Bonus and Equity Compensation: Effective January 1, 2017, the annual target opportunity under our bonus incentive plan was increased to 175% of base salary paid in the plan year. Effective January 1, 2017, for our equity incentive plan, the annual target grant date value opportunity was increased to 350% of base salary. 
Termination Provisions: In the event of a termination of employment by the company without cause, as defined in the agreement, in addition to his accrued benefits, the executive is entitled to a one-time lump sum severance payment equal to two times his then current base salary, subject to the executive's timely execution and delivery of a general release. Additionally, upon such a termination all outstanding unvested time-vesting equity awards that were granted after November 4, 2010 will automatically vest and, in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, will remain exercisable for a period of four years from the date of

[END TABLE]
 termination (but not beyond the maximum term of the award). Also, upon such a termination, all outstanding performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term. 
In the event of executive's death or disability, as defined in the agreement, all unvested time-vesting equity awards granted after November 4, 2010 will vest and, in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, will remain exercisable for a period of four years from the date of the event (but not beyond the maximum term of the award) and all performance-based equity awards shall become vested at the target level and become payable within 30 days following the date of death or termination for disability. 
Change of Control: In the event of a change of control, as defined in the agreement, prior to termination of employment, all of the executive's unvested time-vesting equity awards shall become vested and all of the executive's performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term (unless a more favorable treatment is provided in the agreement evidencing the particular award or applies to the award pursuant to the operation of the applicable plan under which the award was granted, in which case such more favorable treatment will apply). If executive is involuntarily terminated without cause within 60 days prior to a change of control, all of his unvested time-vesting equity awards that would have been outstanding had he been employed on the date of the change of control will become vested and all performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term (unless a more favorable treatment is provided in the agreement evidencing the particular award or applies to the award pursuant to the operation of the applicable plan under which the award was granted, in which case such more favorable treatment will apply). 
Non-Compete Provision: The agreement also contains a provision prohibiting the executive during the term of his employment, and for one year thereafter, from being employed in an executive or managerial capacity by, or providing, whether as an employee, partner, independent contractor, consultant or otherwise, any services of an executive or managerial nature, or any services similar to those provided by him to the company, to a competing business. 
Treatment of Equity at Expiration: If employed by the company on December 31, 2020, all outstanding unvested time-vesting equity awards granted to the executive after November 11, 2015 will vest and all performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term, which vesting is subject to executive's timely execution and delivery of a general release. Further, if employed by the company on December 31, 2022, all outstanding unvested time-vesting equity awards granted to the executive will vest and all performance-based equity awards shall become vested or be forfeited solely based on actual performance measured over the full performance term, which vesting is subject to executive's timely execution and delivery of a general release. 
Treatment of Annual Bonus at Expiration: If employed by the company on December 31, 2022, then executive shall be entitled to a bonus opportunity under our bonus incentive plan and any continued employment requirement of the applicable bonus award or its payment shall be waived subject to executive's timely execution and delivery of a general release. 
Additional Benefits: In the event of executive's disability or following any termination of employment by him voluntarily or by the company without cause, the executive will also be entitled to receive insurance and health benefits until the earlier to occur of (i) the fourth anniversary of the expiration or termination, as applicable, or (ii) the date the executive is covered by comparable insurance and health benefits. In the event that life insurance coverage results in taxable income to executive's beneficiaries, CME Group will provide a gross up. 
Severance Protection Agreements 
In December 2016, the committee approved enhancements to the severance benefits offered to our named executive officers (other than Mr. Duffy, who is party to the agreement described above) to better align severance benefits with competitive levels, strengthening leadership continuity during organizational change. We entered into severance protection agreements with the named executive officers other than Mr. Duffy, which provide for the following benefits in the event of a termination without cause (as defined in the agreement) through December 31, 2018, subject to the executive executing a release of claims in favor of the company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum severance payment equal to 150% of the executive's annual base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting of time-vesting restricted shares scheduled to vest during the  18-month period following termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued eligibility to vest in performance shares for which the performance period ends during the 18-month period following termination (with vesting to be based on actual performance results);  
[END TABLE]

• company payment of COBRA premiums for 18 months following termination; and

• six months of outplacement services.  
[END TABLE]
The description above is only a summary of the terms of the severance protection agreements and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the form agreement filed with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K on December 9, 2016. 
Other CME Policies and Practices 
The following is a summary of our other plans in place that provide for benefits upon termination of employment and/or in the event of a change of control. 
Annual Performance Bonuses. In accordance with the terms of our bonus plans, in the event an employee dies or becomes disabled, he or she or his or her beneficiaries will be entitled to receive a pro rata bonus, subject to actual performance. 
Equity Plans. We make equity grants to our employees under the Omnibus Stock Plan. All of the outstanding awards for our named executive officers follow the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Stock Plan. The terms of the employment agreement for Mr. Duffy govern his equity awards. 
In the event of death, the employee's beneficiaries would vest in any outstanding equity awards, with outstanding performance shares vesting at the target level. In the event of termination due to disability, outstanding restricted stock awards become vested and outstanding performance shares become vested at the target level. Awards automatically vest upon a change of control (as defined in the Omnibus Stock Plan), with performance shares vesting at the greater of actual performance at the time of the change of control or the target level.

(1)  Cash severance represents contractual amount for Mr. Duffy in accordance with his employment agreement. Cash  severance for Mr. Pietrowicz, Mr. Durkin, Ms. Holzrichter and Mr. Tully is pursuant to the terms of their severance protection agreements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Amounts shown for the "Value of Equity Subject to Accelerated Vesting" are based on the applicable stock plan,  severance plan and contractual provisions in place and include accelerated vesting of outstanding options, restricted stock and performance shares as applicable. For purposes of this analysis, for performance awards tied to performance periods  ending on or before December 31, 2018, the actual number of shares earned was used in the calculations for applicable scenarios; for outstanding performance awards tied to performance beyond 2018, the target number of shares was used in the  calculations. The values were determined using the closing price on December 31, 2018 of $188.12.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Amounts shown for the "Continuation of Health and Welfare Benefits" reflect our contractual agreements with  named executive officers in effect during 2018. Mr. Pietrowicz does not participate in the company's medical plans and therefore is not eligible for continued coverage through COBRA. Mr. Duffy's continuing benefits do not reflect  the additional amounts that CME Group may incur in connection with the self-insurance of certain benefits as previously described because such amounts were granted for the purposes of providing Mr. Duffy with the disability insurance benefits  based on two-thirds of base salary (subject to plan maximums) and life insurance benefits based on three times base salary (subject to plan maximums) consistent with benefits provided to other employees on a  broad basis.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median annual total compensation of our employees (other than Mr. Duffy, who serves in the role of Chief Executive  Officer) was $137,287;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of Mr. Duffy, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $13,416,665; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as a result, the annual total compensation of Mr. Duffy is estimated to be 98 times that of the median annual total  compensation of our employees (other than Mr. Duffy).  
[END TABLE]
Per the SEC rules, we have chosen to utilize the same median employee as last year, given there have been no significant changes in either our employee population or compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would impact our calculation. Further, the individual previously selected as the median employee did not receive a promotion or above market pay raise, we did not make changes to any of our compensation programs impacting our broader employee population and we did not experience significant turnover in our employee population over the past 12 months. 
It is important to note that CME Group did complete an acquisition of NEX in November 2018, which has significantly changed our employee population and will require us to identify a new median employee next year. However, SEC rules allow for a transition period for companies that are completing an acquisition in the fiscal year in which the transaction becomes effective, which allowed us to exclude these employees for purposes of the above calculation. For reference, the approximate number of employees acquired and excluded is 1,750. 
Consistent with the prior year methodology, we selected a measurement date of December 31, 2018, our fiscal year-end. As of that date, our global employee population consisted of approximately 2,950 staff, with 73% (2,165) of these employees working in the United States and the remaining 27% (795) working in our various non-U.S. locations (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United Kingdom). 
Under the "de minimis exemption" adjustment permitted under the SEC rules, the following countries and employee counts were again excluded from our median employee determination: Australia (1), Brazil (2), Canada (1), China (3), Hong Kong (19), Japan (3), Singapore (52) and South Korea (3). Our employee population, after taking the "de minimis exemption" into account, consisted of approximately 2,875 individuals. 
Our median employee calculation aggregates actual base salary earnings in 2018, overtime earnings paid in 2018 for employees eligible to earn overtime, bonus awards earned in 2018 and paid in March 2019 and the grant date value of any equity awards granted in 2018. The sum of these amounts represents our "consistently applied compensation measure," used in identifying the median employee. We do not apply a cost of living adjustment to the data. 
The total annual compensation for the "median employee" was determined using the Summary Compensation Table methodology, which included the change in pension value for the median employee and 401(k) contributions made by the firm in 2018. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have differing employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

Our directors play a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and overseeing management. Developments in corporate governance and financial reporting have resulted in an increased demand for highly qualified directors. We provide compensation commensurate with our directors' workload, risk and opportunity costs. In addition, to satisfy our self-regulatory responsibilities, we have established a number of functional exchange committees of which certain of our directors are members. Our compensation program for our non-executive directors is designed to compensate our directors based on their respective levels of board participation and responsibilities, including service on board committees and functional exchange committees. 
Similar to our philosophy on management pay, we generally target the 50th percentile of the competitive market for compensation of the board of directors. We also review the range of values around the median, including the 25th and 75th percentiles. The primary components of our board member compensation package consist of an annual cash stipend, committee meeting fees, an annual equity stipend, chairperson retainers for our non-executive chairs, additional meeting fees for certain committee chairs and a stipend for our independent Lead Director. Non-executive board members are eligible to participate in our Director Deferred Compensation Plan. 
During our annual review of director pay in 2018, we determined that pay had fallen below the 25th percentile of our peer group. (See page 43 for the companies within our peer group.) As a result, the compensation committee conducted a formal review of director pay across each component, including our cash stipend, equity stipend and approach to meeting fees. Following a review by the committee's advisor, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC, the committee sought to increase both the cash stipend and equity stipend to position overall pay at the 25th percentile. The compensation committee recommended, and the board approved, an increase in the compensation for our non-executive directors: cash stipend (increase from $60,000 to $80,000) and equity stipend (increase from $100,000 in value to $120,000). The increase was effective as of September 1, 2018. 
The compensation of our board members is set forth in the table entitled Director Compensation Table on page 65. 
FEES AND COMPENSATION PLANS FOR CME GROUP NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS 
The compensation committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the board the compensation for the non-executive directors of CME Group. Only non-executive directors receive compensation for their service as a director. Our non-executive director compensation includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual  Stipends         
 Annual cash stipend(1)     $  80,000    
 Annual retainer for non-executive directors serving as a committee chair     $  20,000    
 Annual equity stipend(2)     $  120,000    
 Annual Lead Director stipend     $  25,000    
 Meeting  Fees         
 Meeting fees for audit, clearing house  oversight, compensation, executive, finance, governance, market regulation oversight, nominating and risk committees(3)     $  1,500    
 Additional meeting fee for non-executive directors serving as chair of the foregoing committees     $  500    
 Meeting fee for the strategic steering,  clearing house risk, interest rate swap risk and credit default swap risk committees and for other functional exchange committees(3)(4)     $  1,000    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Directors have the option to elect to receive some or the entire portion of their annual cash stipend, which is paid pro-rata on a monthly basis, in shares of stock valued at the closing price on the date of grant. If a director who elects to receive additional stock leaves the board prior to the next annual meeting, such director  will be responsible for repaying us for the amount of the unearned stipend that otherwise would have been paid in cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Shares received are granted under our Director Stock Plan and are not subject to any vesting restrictions.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The fee for telephonic participation in a regularly scheduled CME Group board committee meeting is 50% of that for in-person participation. However, it is within the discretion of the particular committee chairman to determine if it is appropriate to pay the full meeting fee, taking into consideration the member's ability  to participate based upon the particular circumstances. It is within the discretion of a committee to create a subcommittee to address a specific issue and to determine whether members of such subcommittee should receive fees up to the amount of the  regular committee meeting fee for their participation in such subcommittee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The strategic steering committee was disbanded in August 2018 and the credit default swap risk committee was disbanded in  March 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Non-executive directors may participate in our Director Deferred Compensation Plan in the market investments that the plan offers from time to time. The return on the investments selected by the directors is the only return they will receive on their deferred compensation. We do not provide any pension, health benefit or other benefit programs to our non-executive directors. 
The following table provides information regarding the compensation earned during the year ended December 31, 2018 by each of our current directors, except for Mr. Duffy, and for directors who retired during 2018. The compensation for Mr. Duffy as a named executive officer is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54.

(1)  The amounts reflected in the "Fees Earned or Paid in Cash" consist of annual cash stipends, cash payments made  due to share rounding of the stock award, committee meeting fees (board, functional and subcommittee) and annual retainers for the committee chairs, including amounts deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Board committee and  functional committee meeting fees are subject to an overall cap of $100,000 per year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts reflected in the "Stock Awards" column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value computed in  accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. See note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements of CME Group Inc. and subsidiaries for more details on the assumptions made in the valuation of stock awards. The  value of 2018 stock awards was calculated using the closing price on June 25, 2018 of $166.49 and on September 25, 2018 of $173.60. The awards represent our annual grant to our non-executive board  members, which are not subject to any vesting restrictions. The amounts include the pro rata grant in connection with the increase in the equity stipend, which was made in September. Awards in excess of $115,164 are due to the director's  election to receive additional shares in lieu of all or a portion of his or her annual cash stipend. No other awards were made to our non-executive board members in 2018.

DIRECTOR STOCK PLAN 
Our Director Stock Plan provides for the issuance of up to 625,000 shares of Class A common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of a merger, reorganization or similar corporate event involving us) through awards of non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and shares of common stock. The plan is administered by the compensation committee, which has the responsibility for recommending to the board the annual equity stipend for our non-executive directors. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
Our non-executive board members are subject to stock ownership guidelines valued at two times the total annual retainer (representing 5 times the cash portion of the retainer, or $400,000). Each member has five years from May 2008 or election to the board, whichever is later, to achieve this stock ownership guideline. As of the 2018 review, all of our board members with five or more years of board service had satisfied the guideline. 
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN FORMER DIRECTORS 
Mr. Melamed. During 2018, we had two written consulting agreements with Mr. Melamed. One applied during the time he served on our board and the other applies from his retirement from the board on May 9, 2018 with a term through the end of his lifetime. 
In accordance with the terms of the written agreement in effect during his board service, Mr. Melamed provided us with consulting services relating to the financial services industry and related matters within Mr. Melamed's areas of expertise. For these services, Mr. Melamed received $300,000 per annum plus all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket travel and other expenses incurred in connection with the consulting services and up to $190,000 annually for non-travel expenses, including office and secretarial expenses. Under the agreement, Mr. Melamed may not, without our prior written consent, render services to any competitor or otherwise compete with us throughout the term of the agreement and for one year thereafter. Mr. Melamed also received compensation for his service on our board. 
Under the terms of the written agreement that took effect on May 9, 2018 until his death or until his termination of the agreement, Mr. Melamed provides us with similar consulting services and receives $300,000 per annum plus reimbursement for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket travel and other expenses incurred relating to his service. We will also provide office and secretarial support during the term of the agreement. Mr. Melamed may not render services to any competitor or otherwise compete with us during the term of the agreement without our prior written consent. In the event the agreement is terminated during Mr. Melamed's lifetime he will continue to be subject to the non-compete provisions for one year after such termination. 
For the two-year period following Mr. Melamed's retirement from the board, he will receive additional compensation for his consulting services in the amount of $1 million per year. 
Mr. Sandner. Mr. Sandner, who retired from the board on May 9, 2018, serves as a consultant to the board for which he receives compensation of $1 million per year. This arrangement is expected to continue until at least the two-year anniversary of his retirement from the board. 
The following tables show the amount of common stock owned by each of our directors, director nominees and by each executive officer who is not also a director named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54 of this proxy statement, and by all directors and executive officers as a group and the amount of common stock beneficially owned by individuals owning more than five percent of our Class A common stock as of March 11, 2019 unless otherwise noted. In general, "beneficial ownership" includes those shares over which a person has the power to vote, or the power to transfer, and stock options that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of March 11, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. None of our directors, director nominees or executive officers beneficially own more than one percent of any class of common stock. Shares have been rounded to the nearest full amount.

CERTAIN BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Our audit committee has adopted a written policy for the review of related party transactions. A copy of our related party transaction approval policy is available on our website. Related party transactions are transactions in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related parties consist of our directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, holders of more than five percent of our outstanding Class A common stock, and the immediate family members of these individuals, as defined in the policy. Our Office of the Secretary, in consultation with management and outside counsel, as appropriate, will review potential related party transactions to determine if they are subject to our related party transactions policy. Certain transactions, including compensation and ordinary course trading activity on any of our exchanges, are considered pre-approved and thus do not require specific approval under the policy. 
In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the audit committee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, whether there are compelling business reasons to proceed, and whether the transaction would impair the independence of a non-management director or present an improper conflict of interest for a director or executive officer, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the related person, the direct or indirect nature of his or her interest in the transaction, the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the committee deems relevant. The policy also provides that certain engagements by us of a large firm in which an immediate family member of a director or executive officer is a general partner of such firm will not be considered a related party transaction; provided certain factors are met, including that such family member did not have any involvement in the selection or engagement process, does not receive any compensation or credit in connection with the engagement other than that provided to the other unaffiliated partners and that no other facts or circumstances exist suggesting that the immediate family member has any direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. 
We do not consider the amounts involved in the transactions described in this section to be material to our business or material in relation to the businesses of such other companies or the interests of the individuals involved. We recognize the need for transparency and additional disclosure regarding transactions between an issuer and its insiders. However, we do not believe that these disclosures should be a substitute for the overall independence test for determining whether a material relationship exists. 
Transactions Relating to Trading Activity in 2018 
We are a unique organization stemming from our evolution from a member-owned organization to a public company. In connection with such transition, we recognized the need to maintain the deep industry knowledge of members of our trading community as board members. As a result, some of our board members continue to participate in our markets from which we derive revenue. Payments relating to trading activity include clearing and transaction fees, market data and information services fees and connection fees. A substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees is received directly from our clearing firms which include charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers, some of whom may be members of our board or Class B director nominees. Payments received directly by clearing firms in which a board member or Class B director nominee has a significant affiliation are based upon our financial records. Other payments, which are not derived from our financial records because they are processed indirectly through a clearing firm, are set forth below but the actual amounts are not included. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Beitler is the founder of one of our member firms that made aggregate payments to us indirectly through its  clearing firm in excess of $120,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Carey is a principal of two member firms that made aggregate payments to us indirectly through their clearing firm  in excess of $120,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hertshten is the owner of a clearing firm that made net payments to us of approximately $108 million and the  owner of a member firm that made net payments to us in excess of $120,000. Mr. Hertshten's brother-in-law is also a member of our exchange and made aggregate  payments to us indirectly through a clearing firm in excess of $120,000.

• Mr. Hobert owns a majority interest in one of our member firms that made payments to us indirectly through its clearing  firm in excess of $120,000.

• Mr. Siegel made payments to us indirectly through his clearing firm in excess of $120,000.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Wescott is part owner in one of our member firms that made payments to us indirectly through its clearing firm in  excess of $120,000.  
[END TABLE]
The fees we charge our customers, including any of our board members, are based on published fee schedules and no benefits or discounts are provided to our board members that are not otherwise made available to similarly situated customers. We, therefore, do not believe that such transactions impair the independence of such individuals and any potential conflicts are handled appropriately under our director conflict of interest policy, a copy of which is available on our website. Our other board members and director nominees who participate in our markets also incur trading fees, but such fees were below $120,000 during 2018. The foregoing transactions relating to trading activity are considered pre-approved under the audit committee's related party transaction approval policy. 
Other Relationships 
Ms. Lockett is the Chief Executive Officer of LEAP Innovations. LEAP Innovations received a grant of $250,000 from the CME Group Foundation in 2018. In 2018, the board of the CME Group Foundation approved the renewal of the three-year grant to LEAP Innovations: $250,000 in 2019; $250,000 in 2020 and $250,000 in 2021. As these charitable contributions were entered into prior to Ms. Lockett's nomination, the terms were not submitted to the audit committee for its approval in accordance with its policy on related party transactions. 
An in-law of Mr. Pankau is employed by us in a non-officer position. The employment relationship occurred prior to Mr. Pankau's service on our board. The employee received aggregate compensation in 2018 of approximately $305,000 (part of which included an annual equity award) and other benefits provided to employees at the same level. The compensation is in accordance with our standard compensation practices applicable to similarly-situated employees. The audit committee previously ratified this related party transaction and receives annual reports on the compensation arrangements as part of its review of ongoing related party transactions. 
Mr. Sandner, who retired from the board in May 2018, sub-leases his office space from us. In 2018, we received lease payments of approximately $180,000. The original sub-lease was negotiated on an arm's length basis and was on terms consistent with our overall master lease and other existing leases at the location at the time of execution. The audit committee reviewed and approved the original sub-leasing relationship. The term of the original sub-lease was extended in 2015. The audit committee ratified the extension in 2016. 
Mr. Spencer, who was appointed to the board in November 2018 in connection with our acquisition of NEX, has the following investments: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Exotix Holdings Ltd. Mr. Spencer (through IPGL (Holdings) Limited (IPGL), a private investment company  controlled by Mr. Spencer) owns approximately 87% of Exotix Holdings Ltd (Exotix) and NEX Group Limited, a subsidiary in the CME Group organization, owns approximately 4% of Exotix. Exotix is a London-based provider of trade and  investment services in emerging markets around the world. As of December 31, 2018, there was an outstanding balance of £0.5 million due from Exotix to NEX Group Limited. As the loan was entered into prior to Mr. Spencer's  appointment, the terms were not submitted to the audit committee for its approval in accordance with its policy on related party transactions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Gain Capital Holdings, Inc. Mr. Spencer (through IPGL) owns 12.6% of GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc. (GAIN)  as well as $52.2 million of convertible debt issued by GAIN. GAIN is a US-based, Nasdaq-listed provider of online trading services and provides market access and trade execution services in foreign  exchange, contracts for difference and exchange-based products to retail investors. During 2018, the Company collected revenue of $1.9 million from

CHARITABLE AND CIVIC CONTRIBUTIONS 
We believe that it is both a responsibility and a privilege to give back to the global communities where we live and work. Through our charitable programs and foundations, we are able to put change in motion that will positively impact the lives of those in need. Through our corporate foundation, CME Group Community Foundation, we made charitable grants focused on the locations where we do business and provided support to three primary areas of concern: children in need, education, and health and human services. Certain members of our board also serve on the CME Group Foundation. Our board members and executive officers may have affiliations with organizations that have received donations from these foundations. None of the donations made by these foundations were deemed to impact the independence of any of our board members or director nominees, other than Ms. Lockett as previously discussed as it related to support provided in 2016. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of the forms we have received, all of our officers and directors complied with their Section 16(a) filing requirements during 2018. 
CATEGORICAL INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS 
A director who satisfies the independence requirements of the applicable listing standards and meets all of the following categorical standards shall be presumed to be "independent": 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The director does not (directly or indirectly as a partner, shareholder or officer of another company) provide consulting,  legal or financial advisory services to the company or the company's present or former auditors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Neither the director nor any member of his or her immediate family is a significant shareholder in the company's  Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. For purposes of this categorical standard, a shareholder shall be considered significant if the ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock is greater than five percent (5%) of the  outstanding Class A Common Stock or if the ownership of shares of any series of Class B Common Stock is greater than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Class B Common Stock in such series.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Neither the director nor any member of his or her immediate family serves as an executive officer of a civic or charitable  organization that receives financial contributions from us or the CME Group Community Foundation (excluding payments pursuant to a matching gift program) or the CME Group Foundation in excess of $200,000 or five percent (5%) of that entity's  total annual charitable receipts and other revenues, whichever is greater, per year. The Board shall also consider whether any charitable donations made to a civic or charitable organization in which a director or member of his or her immediate  family serves as a director, trustee or employed fundraiser impact the particular director's independence; provided, however, donations less than $200,000 per year shall be presumed to be insignificant and, therefore, not impact such  director's independence.  
[END TABLE]
